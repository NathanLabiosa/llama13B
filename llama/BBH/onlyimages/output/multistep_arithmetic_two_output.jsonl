An equation is a set of two or more expressions that are equal to each other.\nAn expression is a combination of numbers, letters, and operations.\nFor example, the number of lemons is equal to 3.

So, the variable for the number of sugar packets is \"sugar\".\nThe number of water bottles is equal to 4 more than the number of lemons. So, the variable for the number of water bottles is \"water\".\nFinally, the assistant needs to make sure they have enough money to pay for the ingredients and the stand. They need $20.00.

These effects combine to change the price of each energy type.\nFor example, the law decreases the supply of coal and increases the demand for wind and solar power. This means that the price of coal goes up, while the price of wind and solar power goes down.\nAn increase in price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded.

This means to multiply the non-terminal numbers together and then multiply the terminal numbers together. For example, consider the equation 3x + 4 = 11. To solve this equation, first cross-multiply: 3x * 4 = 11 * 4. Then, solve the resulting equation: 3x = 11 * 4 / 4. Simplify: 3x = 11 / 4. Finally, solve for x: x = 11 / 4.\nAnother way to solve an equation is to use a table to calculate the answer. For example, consider the equation 6x + 2 = 11. To solve this equation, use a table to calculate the answer:\nx | 6x + 2 = 11\n--- | ---\n0 | 11\n-1 | 11 - 6\n-2 | 11 - 6 - 2\nUse the table to find the answer: x = -2.\nSOLUTION: To decide which method to use, think about which approach will leave you with a simpler answer. Cross-multiplication may be easier to follow, but it may also result in a more complicated final answer. The table method may be easier to understand, but it may also be more time-consuming to use."}

For example, the function f(x) = x^2 is a relationship between the variable x and the value x^2.\nThe value of a function at a certain point is called a function's value at that point. The graph of a function is a set of points that contain its values.\nIf a function describes a curve, then the maximum and minimum values of the function occur at points on the curve. To find the maximum and minimum values of a function, you need to find the points on the graph of the function where the function takes on its maximum and minimum values.\nSOLUTION: To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^2 - 8x - 7 + 2x + 8, use the following steps:\n1. Find the derivative of the function. The derivative of a function describes the rate at which the function is changing.\nf'(x) = 2x - 8.\n2. Set the derivative to zero and solve the equation to find the points on the graph of the function where the function takes on its maximum and minimum values.\n2x - 8 = 0\nx = 4\n3. Find the values of the function at the points where it takes on its maximum and minimum values.\nf(4) = 2 + 8 = 10\nf(4) = 7 - 8 = -1\n4. The minimum value of the function is -1. The minimum value occurs at x = 4.\nThe maximum value of the function is 10. The maximum value occurs at x = 4."}

Solar panels are made of photovoltaic cells, which are made of silicon.\nWhen sunlight strikes a photovoltaic cell, it creates a flow of electrons. This flow of electrons is an electric current. The electric current can be used to power small appliances, or it can be fed into a home's electrical grid.\nSOLUTION: A 100-watt solar panel can generate 100 watts of electricity when the sun is shining. If the cost of the solar panel is $150, the cost per watt is $1.50/W.\nThe payback period is the number of years it takes for the solar panel to generate enough electricity to pay for itself.\nUsing the calculations above, the payback period is 150 / 100 = 1.5 years."}
