This type of exchange can also be called a Yankee swap, because it was popularized in the United States.\nThe name \"white elephant\" comes from a gift that was considered valuable but also useless. In ancient Southeast Asia, white elephants were considered sacred. However, they were expensive to own and maintain, and actually had little practical use.\nA white elephant gift exchange can have any number of people. The more people who participate, the more times the gifts will be traded.\nHere are some examples of how a white elephant gift exchange might play out:\nExample 1: In a group of 4 people, each person gets a different color present. They trade pairs of presents until everyone has a different present.\nIn this example, each present is traded one time.\nExample 2: In a group of 5 people, each person gets a different color present. They trade in pairs each time, so that the number of presents stays the same.\nIn this example, the orange ball is not traded at all.\nExample 3: In a group of 6 people, each person gets a different color present.

A central economic question is whether certain resources are allocated to their most valuable uses. One way to help answer this question is to understand the incentives that shape the allocation of resources.\nIncentives can be described in terms of the returns and costs of different activities. Returns are the benefits that an activity generates. Costs are the resources that an activity requires.\nThe following figures show the relationship between returns and costs.\nFigure C:\nImagine an economy with two possible activities: producing wine and producing wheat.\nThe diagram shows the returns and costs of each activity. The returns are measured on the left axis, and the costs are measured on the right axis.\nThe point within the diagram represents the sector that produces wine. The point on the wine production sector of the diagram shows the returns and costs of that activity.\nThe point within the diagram represents the sector that produces wheat. The point on the wheat production sector of the diagram shows the returns and costs of that activity.\nThe intersection of the returns and costs of each sector determines whether that sector is allocated to its most valuable use.\nIn a well-functioning economy, the points of the activities that have the highest returns and the lowest costs will intersect. This ensures that the resources are allocated to their most valuable uses.\nSOLUTION: The goal of a team is to win the game. The team's chances of winning are better when the players are in the positions that optimize their contributions to the team.\nBefore the positions are changed, Bob is playing right midfielder. This position is optimal for Bob if he is the player on the team who can best contribute to the team from that position. This means that the return from playing right midfielder is higher than the return from playing other positions for Bob. The return from playing right midfielder is higher than the return from playing any other position for Bob. So, Bob is in the position that optimizes his contribution to the team.\nAfter the positions are changed, Alice is playing right midfielder. This position is not optimal for Alice.

These decisions can have a big impact on the environment.\nFor example, a company might choose to produce goods using fossil fuels, which can harm the environment. Consumers might choose to buy goods produced using fossil fuels instead of goods produced using renewable energy.\nOne way to address these environmental impacts is to put a price on pollution. This can help companies and consumers make decisions that are better for the environment.\nFor example, if a company has to pay for the pollution its activities produce, then the company will have an incentive to reduce its pollution. Consumers will also have an incentive to buy products that are produced using fewer pollutants.\nPolicymakers can use a variety of economic tools to design a carbon price that is effective at reducing pollution. Some of the factors they might consider include:\nthe level of the carbon price\nthe design of the carbon price (e.g., a tax or a cap-and-trade system)\nhow the carbon price is applied (e.g., does it apply to all companies, or just to those in a specific sector?)\nhow the carbon price is used (e.g., is it used to fund programs or to pay down debt?)\nSOLUTION: An effective carbon price can help reduce pollution and improve environmental outcomes.\nBy putting a price on pollution, a carbon price incentivizes companies and consumers to make decisions that are better for the environment. For example, a carbon price can help encourage companies to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

The prices of the balls, or the information needed to determine the prices, are not described in the game. So, you cannot use market mechanisms to determine which player gets each ball at the end of the game.\nYou can see that the game has multiple equilibrium states.

In an ideal market economy, the allocation of resources is determined by the markets for goods and services.\nMarkets for goods and services are designed by nature to be efficient. An elegant body of theory demonstrates that, under certain conditions, markets will allocate resources in ways that are efficient.\nAn allocation of resources is efficient if it maximizes the value of the goods and services produced. One of the conditions for efficient allocations is that prices reflect the costs of production. When prices reflect the costs of production, they can guide markets to allocate resources in efficient ways.\nProducers who face market prices will respond to changes in prices by changing their production. Higher prices increase the profit that producers can earn. So, higher prices will increase the quantity of goods and services produced. Lower prices decrease the profit that producers can earn. So, lower prices will decrease the quantity of goods and services produced.\nBy producing more goods and services, producers increase the value of the goods and services produced. So, efficient allocations of resources maximize the value of the goods and services produced.\nSOLUTION: The positions of the players in the soccer match are assigned by the coach. The coach can determine which positions maximize the value of the team's performance.\nThe coach can evaluate each player's performance to determine which positions maximize the value of the team's performance.\nIf Claire is playing center midfielder, the team's value is $1,000.

One way to do this is to have players swap positions with each other. For example, a fullback might swap positions with a winger.\nPositions are the different jobs that players do on the field. Each position has its own set of responsibilities.\nThe cheerleader is a player who does not play on the field.

As a result of these trade relationships, each country receives goods and services that it did not produce at home. This process is called international trade.\nOne of the main benefits of international trade is that it allows countries to specialize in producing specific goods and services. This specialization can lead to increased efficiency and lower costs. For example, a country with abundant resources may specialize in producing and exporting those resources. A country with a large number of skilled workers may specialize in producing and exporting high-tech goods.\nAnother benefit of international trade is that it allows countries to access a broader range of goods and services. This can lead to higher living standards. For example, importing goods can provide a country with goods that are not produced domestically. Exporting goods can provide a country with foreign currency, which can be used to import goods.\nSOLUTION: In the game described above, Alice, Bob, and Claire trade balls to each get a different ball. As a result of this trade, all three players receive balls they did not have before.\nThe international trade example and the game have two main differences. In international trade, countries trade goods and services. In the game, players trade balls. Also, in international trade, countries aim to gain from the trade. In the game, the players are not trying to hurt each other. They are trying to end up with a different set of balls.\nDespite these differences, the two examples have the same effect.
