{"question": "True and not not ( not False ) is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When you write a condition in an if statement, you can use a boolean expression to decide whether the condition is true or false.\nA boolean expression is an expression that can take on one of two values: true or false.\nSome examples of boolean expressions are:\nx > 5\nx < 5\nx = 5\ny = 3\nThese expressions are evaluated to true or false.\nThe expression x > 5 is true when x is greater than 5.\nThe expression x < 5 is true when x is less than 5.\nThe expression x = 5 is true when x is equal to 5.\nThe expression y = 3 is true when y is equal to 3.\nYou can use these expressions in an if statement to execute code only when the expression is true. For example, consider the following code:\nif (x > 5) {\nprint(\"x is greater than 5.\");\n}\nWhen the value of x is greater than 5, the print statement is executed.\n\nSOLUTION: An oil spill can have a major impact on the environment. Oil spills can harm birds, animals, and people. They can also harm the ocean and coastlines.\nTo help prevent oil spills, it is important to identify and address the risks. One way to do this is to conduct a spill analysis. A spill analysis can help predict the behavior of an oil spill. This can help identify the measures that need to be taken to prevent or mitigate the impact of an oil spill.\nHere are some examples of what a spill analysis might consider:\nThe type of oil: Different oils can behave differently when spilled. For example, light, volatile oils may spread more quickly than heavier, less volatile oils.\nThe conditions of the ocean or environment: The behavior of an oil spill can depend on the conditions of the ocean or environment in which the spill occurs. For example, wind and waves can affect how an oil spill spreads.\nThe location of the spill: The location of the spill can affect how an oil spill affects birds, animals, and people. For example, a spill in a sensitive habitat might have a greater impact than a spill in an area with less sensitive wildlife."}

{"question": "( False ) or not False or True is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: One key difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources is their availability. Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible, which means that they will never run out. Some renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, have the potential to provide unlimited energy. Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite. This means that they will eventually be depleted.\nAnother key difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources is their environmental impact. Renewable energy sources have a much lower environmental impact than non-renewable sources. For example, wind and solar power do not produce any air or water pollution. In contrast, non-renewable energy sources can lead to air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other negative effects.\nThe cost of a energy source is another important factor to consider. The initial costs of renewable energy sources can be higher than those of non-renewable sources. However, renewable energy sources typically have lower operational costs. This means that, over time, renewable energy sources may be more cost-effective than non-renewable sources.\nReliability is another key difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources are often more reliable and can be used in more remote locations than non-renewable sources. This is because renewable energy can be harnessed in a variety of ways, such as wind or solar panels, while non-renewable sources may require expensive infrastructure to extract and transport them.\nFlexibility is another important factor to consider. Renewable energy sources are often more flexible and can be adapted to different situations and needs, while non-renewable sources are more rigid and inflexible. For example, it is easier to increase or decrease the number of wind turbines in a wind farm than it is to change the output of a coal-fired power plant.\nSOLUTION: Sustainability is the ability to continue into the future. Renewable energy sources are more sustainable over the long term than non-renewable sources. This is because renewable energy sources are replenished naturally, which means that they will not run out. In contrast, the use of non-renewable energy sources can lead to economic and social"}

In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A prototype is tested when it is exposed to real-world conditions. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can examine one design, or they may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind to see if it would move too much."}
{"question": "not False or ( True or True ) is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When making a decision, it is important to consider all of the options and their possible outcomes. One way to do this is to use a decision matrix. A decision matrix is a table that shows how different options compare to each other. You can use a decision matrix to consider the factors that are important to you, and to decide which option is the best.\nThere are two types of decision matrices: categorical and quantitative.\nA categorical decision matrix compares options based on categories. For example, you could use a categorical decision matrix to compare colleges. You could have one column for campus location, one column for size of the student body, and one column for available majors. Each cell in the matrix would contain a comparison of the options in that category.\nA quantitative decision matrix compares options based on numbers. For example, you could use a quantitative decision matrix to compare cars. You could have one column for the price of the car, one column for the fuel efficiency, and one column for the safety rating. Each cell in the matrix would contain a comparison of the options in that category.\nWhen you use a decision matrix, consider the following:\nThe factors you use in your decision matrix are important to you.\nThe options in your decision matrix are relevant to you.\nThe comparisons in your decision matrix are specific and meaningful.\nSOLUTION: To fill in a decision matrix with specific information, consider the following example:\nYou want to decide which college to attend. You could use a decision matrix to compare colleges. The matrix would have columns for important factors, and rows for the colleges you are considering.\nIn this case, the factors are different campuses, large or small student bodies, and strong majors. The options are the colleges you are considering.\nFor each cell in the matrix, decide what comparison to make. A comparison may be a fact about the college, or a prediction about what will happen if you attend that college.\nThe comparison in the \"large or small student body\" column for the University of California, Berkeley is \"UC Berkeley has a small student body.\" This is a fact.\nThe comparison in the \"strong majors\" column for the University of California, Berkeley is \"UC Berkeley has strong majors in many fields.\" This is a prediction."}

These are called conditional statements.\nIf-then statements are made up of two parts: the condition and the conclusion.\nIf the condition is true, then the conclusion will be true.\nIf-then statements can be easy to read. They can be difficult to determine if they are true.\nImagine an engineer needs to check if a bridge will move too much in high wind. So, they build a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, they expose the prototype to high winds and measure how much the bridge moves.\nIf the bridge moves too much, the engineer will have to design a different prototype.\nSo, the engineer wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high winds.\nThe condition of the if-then statement above is \"high winds.\" The conclusion is \"the bridge will move too much.\"\nYou can use a logic gate to determine if this if-then statement is true.\nThe truth table shows what conditions cause the conclusion to be true.\nIn this case, the conclusion is true only when high winds are present."}
{"question": "not False and False and True or False is", "answerKey": "False", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A graphic organizer is a chart or picture that shows how ideas, facts, or topics are related to one another.\nWhen you read, look for graphic organizers included in the text. You can use these images to find key information. You can also create your own graphic organizers with information that you've read. Doing this can help you think about the ideas in the text and easily review them.\nWhen you write, you can use graphic organizers to organize your thoughts and plan your writing.\nSOLUTION: A table is a graphic organizer. It compares information by placing it in rows and columns.\nThis table compares the key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources.\nRenewable energy sources are shown in the Renewable energy sources column. Non-renewable energy sources are shown in the Non-renewable energy sources column.\nThe first row in the table points out that renewable energy sources are not depleted when used. So, they can be used many times.\nThe first row in the table also points out that non-renewable energy sources are depleted when used. So, they can be used many times. But each time they are used, a little more of the resource is gone.\nSo, renewable energy sources are more renewable than non-renewable energy sources."}
{"question": "True or not False and ( False ) is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When evaluating sources of information, it's important to consider the source's qualifications, or what the source knows or claims to know.\nA source may have expertise in a certain area. For example, a scientist is an expert in science. Or, a source may have more knowledge about a certain subject than an average person. For example, a reporter who has interviewed many people about a certain topic may have more information than a person who has only read one article.\nSOLUTION: Consider what the source knows and whether they are an expert in the field. The Rocky Mountain Institute is an expert in the field of energy use and the environment. They have released a report that cites research from the University of Denver's Energy Institute.\nThe report is based on research and is not an opinion."}
{"question": "( not ( False ) ) or False is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When writing an if-else statement, be sure to use the correct syntax.\nIf-else statements have the following syntax:\nIf a condition is true, do this.\nOtherwise, do that.\nBe sure to use the correct indentation and spacing.\nThe condition should be a boolean expression. A boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value. A boolean value is a value that is either true or false.\nExamples of boolean expressions include:\nx > 5\nx >= 5\nx < 5\nx <= 5\na is not b\na is null\nThe if-else statement has two clauses: a clause to execute if the condition is true, and a clause to execute if the condition is false. These clauses are usually followed by a set of instructions.\n\nSOLUTION: In an if-else statement, the condition is followed by a clause to execute if the condition is true. The clause to execute if the condition is true is followed by a set of instructions.\nThen, the if-statement is followed by a else statement. The else statement is followed by a clause to execute if the condition is false. The clause to execute if the condition is false is followed by a set of instructions.\nMake sure that the condition is a boolean expression. If the condition is not a boolean expression, then you will get a compiler error."}
{"question": "True and not True or False and True is", "answerKey": "False", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The following table lists the key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources. As you read through the table, decide if each statement is true or false.\nRenewable energy sources are sustainable, which means that they can be used without running out. Non-renewable energy sources are not sustainable, and their use can lead to environmental harm.\nNon-renewable energy sources are sometimes called fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources can be replenished naturally.\nSOLUTION: True.\nNon-renewable energy sources are finite. This means that they will eventually be depleted. Renewable energy sources are not finite.\nTrue.\nThe environmental impact of renewable energy sources is lower than that of non-renewable sources. This is because renewable energy sources do not release harmful pollutants into the air or water.\nTrue.\nRenewable energy sources are often more expensive to set up than non-renewable sources. But, over time, renewable energy sources tend to have lower operational costs.\nTrue.\nRenewable energy sources can be used in more remote locations than non-renewable sources. This is because renewable energy sources can be stored and transmitted over long distances.\nTrue.\nNon-renewable energy sources are more rigid and inflexible than renewable energy sources. This means that they are not easily adapted to changing situations.\nFalse."}

{"question": "True and ( not True or False ) is", "answerKey": "False", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When evaluating sources of energy, it is important to consider both their advantages and disadvantages.\nRenewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally in a relatively short amount of time, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass.\nNon-renewable energy sources are finite and will eventually be depleted, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\nThe table below shows some examples of renewable and non-renewable energy sources.\n\n| Renewable Energy Source | Non-Renewable Energy Source |\n| --- | --- |\n| Solar | Coal |\n| Wind | Oil |\n| Hydro | Natural gas |\n| Geothermal | N/A |\n| Biomass | N/A |\nSOLUTION: Renewable energy sources and non-renewable energy sources have some key differences.\nAvailability. Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible, while non-renewable energy sources are finite and will eventually run out.\nEnvironmental impact. Renewable energy sources have a much lower environmental impact than non-renewable sources, which can lead to air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other negative effects.\nCost. Renewable energy sources can be more expensive to initially set up, but they typically have lower operational costs than non-renewable sources.\nReliability. Renewable energy sources are often more reliable and can be used in more remote locations than non-renewable sources.\nFlexibility. Renewable energy sources are often more flexible and can be adapted to different situations and needs, while non-renewable sources are more rigid and inflexible.\nSustainability. Renewable energy sources are more sustainable over the long term, while non-renewable sources are not, and their depletion can lead to economic and social instability."}
