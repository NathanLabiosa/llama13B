Some of them are renewable, and others are non-renewable.\nRenewable energy sources can be replenished naturally. This means that they can be repeatedly harvested or collected without using up the source. Some examples of renewable energy sources are wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.\nNon-renewable energy sources cannot be replenished as quickly. This means that they are finite, and there is a limited amount of them. Oil, coal, and natural gas are examples of non-renewable energy sources.\nSOLUTION: Finite means that a resource is limited. It is opposite of infinite.\nA fuel cell uses a fuel to generate electricity. The energy from the fuel is changed into electricity with an efficiency of 60%. This means that 60% of the energy from the fuel is used to generate electricity. The remaining 40% is lost as heat.\nSOLUTION: A 60-watt light bulb can be powered by a 1.8-kilowatt fuel cell for 30 minutes. To calculate this, use the efficiency formula.\n1.8 kilowatts \u00d7 60% = 1.08 kilowatts\n1.08 kilowatts / 60 watts = 17.5 minutes\n17.5 minutes / 30 minutes = 0.58\nThis means that a 60-watt light bulb can be powered by a 1.8-kilowatt fuel cell for 0.58 hours."}

The steps of the process are:\n1. Identify the problem.\n2. Research the problem.\n3. Brainstorm potential solutions.\n4. Choose a solution.\n5. Build a prototype.\n6. Test the prototype.\n7. Implement the solution.\n8. Evaluate the solution.\nEach step of the process builds upon the previous step.\nSOLUTION: First, identify the problem. The problem is that not all students have access to equal amounts of electricity.\nThen, research the problem. Find out what is causing the unequal access to electricity. One possible cause is the cost of electricity. Some people can't afford to pay for a lot of electricity.\nNext, brainstorm potential solutions. One potential solution is to use renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power. These sources of energy are more readily available in some areas than in others. But using renewable energy sources can help make electricity more affordable.\nAnother potential solution is to use energy more efficiently. This can help reduce the amount of electricity that is needed. For example, using LED light bulbs instead of incandescent bulbs can help reduce the amount of electricity that is needed for lighting.\nThen, choose a solution. LECTURE: Choosing a solution involves deciding which potential solution is the best. This can involve considering the costs and benefits of each potential solution.\nFor example, using renewable energy sources may be a more expensive upfront investment. But it may also reduce energy costs in the long run. On the other hand, using energy more efficiently may be a less expensive upfront investment. But it may not reduce energy costs as much in the long run.\nAnother consideration is how well each potential solution solves the problem. For example, using renewable energy sources may not address the underlying issue of unequal access to electricity. But using energy more efficiently can help reduce the amount of electricity that is needed, which can help make electricity more affordable for everyone.\nSOLUTION: Choose a solution."}

This means that they cannot be replenished as quickly as they are used. Instead, they took millions of years to form.\nFossil fuels are formed from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. The remains were buried and exposed to high temperature and pressure. Over time, the remains were converted into fossil fuels.\nUsing fossil fuels is a good example of an unsustainable technology. An unsustainable technology is one that cannot be continued without running into problems.\nAnother challenge of using fossil fuels is that they can contribute to climate change. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. These gases can trap heat, causing the temperature of the earth to increase. This is called global warming.\nSOLUTION: To solve these problems, scientists and engineers are working on new technologies to use Earth's energy sources more efficiently.\nOne of the new technologies is called an infrared solar concentrator. This technology uses infrared radiation from the sun to heat a fluid. The fluid is then used to generate electricity.\nAnother technology is a stirling engine.

Renewable energy sources are resources that can be replenished naturally. This means that they can be constantly reused without running out.\nSOLUTION: Many renewable energy sources can be used to generate electricity. Some common renewable energy sources include wind turbines, solar panels, and hydroelectric dams.\nWind turbines use wind to generate electricity. When wind blows, it turns the blades of a wind turbine. The blades are connected to a generator, which produces electricity.\nSOLUTION: Hydroelectric dams can generate electricity by harnessing the power of moving water. Hydroelectric power uses the kinetic energy of moving water to generate electricity.\nSOLUTION: A biomass plant uses organic matter to generate electricity. Organic matter can include plants, animals, or even garbage.\nSOLUTION: Geothermal power plants use heat from the earth to generate electricity. Geothermal power is a type of renewable energy."}
