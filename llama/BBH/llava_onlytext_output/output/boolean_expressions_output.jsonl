This type of energy use is not sustainable.\nSOLUTION: Renewable energy sources are replenished naturally. This means that they can be used again and again.\nWind, solar, and geothermal energy are renewable energy sources. Water and biomass can also be renewable, depending on how they are used.\nHydro"}
{"question": "True or not False and ( False ) is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Non-renewable energy sources take millions of years to form. These energy sources will run out eventually.\nSOLUTION: This statement is false. Non-renewable energy sources do not take millions of years to form. They take thousands of years to form."}
{"question": "( not ( False ) ) or False is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Non-renewable energy sources take millions of years to form. These energy sources cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used.\nSOLUTION: Non-renewable energy sources are not renewable. They take millions of years to form."}
{"question": "True and not True or False and True is", "answerKey": "False", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Non-renewable energy sources take millions of years to form. We cannot replace the fuel that we use from these sources. As a result, they are not sustainable.\nSOLUTION: The statement is true.\nRenewable energy sources are replenished naturally. We can replace the fuel that we use from these sources. As a result, they are sustainable."}
{"question": "not ( not not not not False ) is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Non-renewable energy sources are finite. This means that they will eventually be depleted.\nThe main non-renewable energy sources are fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas.\nSOLUTION: Energy sources that are not renewable are not sustainable.\nSustainable energy sources are able to keep up with the demand for energy over the long term.\nRenewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can be replenished naturally."}
{"question": "True and ( not True or False ) is", "answerKey": "False", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Renewable energy is energy that comes from resources which are not depleted when used. This means that these resources can be used again and again.\nA wind farm uses wind power to produce electricity.\nA hydropower plant uses the energy of moving water to produce electricity.\nSOLUTION: Renewable energy is not finite. This means that they can be used again and again.\nAn energy source is considered renewable if it can be replenished naturally in a short amount of time. Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, and hyd"}
{"question": "( not not not False or True ) is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Renewable energy sources and nonrenewable energy sources are both used to generate electricity.\nRenewable energy sources can be replenished naturally. Some renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, use the sun and wind, respectively, to generate energy. Other renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power and biomass, use the earth's natural resources to generate energy.\nNonrenewable energy sources cannot be replenished as quickly as renewable energy sources. Fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas"}
