For example, they may not be able to meet all of a country's energy needs at once, and they can be more expensive to set up initially. However, with advances in technology and better policies in place, renewable energy sources are becoming more economically viable and widely used. As a result, it is expected that the proportion of renewable energy in the global energy mix will continue to increase in the coming years, reducing the reliance on non-renewable energy sources and helping to combat climate change.</p><p>In conclusion, renewable energy sources and non-renewable energy sources offer different benefits and limitations. Renewable energy sources are environmentally friendly, sustainable, and more flexible, while non-renewable energy sources are more reliable and convenient.

Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power are becoming increasingly cost-effective and efficient, and can be used in a variety of applications, from small-scale household use to large-scale power generation. By transitioning to renewable energy, we can reduce our reliance on non-renewable energy sources, such as fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases and other pollutants. This can lead to reduced air and water pollution, improved public health, and a slowing of climate change. Additionally, the use of renewable energy can create new job opportunities and economic growth in the renewable energy sector.
