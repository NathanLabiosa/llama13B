{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Frederik Andersen took a three.\"", "answerKey": "no", "model_answer": "No, the sentence is not plausible. \"Frederik Andersen took a three\" would not make sense in the context of a sentence about ice hockey, as there are a number of different ways the sentence could be revised to make it grammatically correct and make sense in the context of ice hockey. For example, it could be revised to say \"Frederik Andersen took a penalty shot,\" which would make sense given that he is a goaltender and penalty shots are a rare event in which a player attempts to score a goal against the opposing team's goaltender."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Adam Thielen got on base.\"", "answerKey": "no", "model_answer": "Yes, the sentence is plausible. Adam Thielen is a real person who is a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL), and he has had success getting on base during his football career.

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Jonas Valanciunas beat the buzzer.\"", "answerKey": "yes", "model_answer": "No, it is not plausible. Jonas Valanciunas is a basketball player who plays for the Memphis Grizzlies in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is a center and has the ability to shoot from outside, but it is unlikely that he would be able to beat the buzzer, which is a reference to a basketball game situation where a player attempts a shot at the end of the game that could potentially tie or win the game. The sentence would make more sense if it was written as \"Jonas Valanciunas hit the buzzer-beating shot\" or something similar, but even then it would still be a rare occurrence in a game."}

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Delon Wright went for it on fourth down.\"", "answerKey": "no", "model_answer": "No, the sentence is not plausible because Delon Wright is a basketball player and the sentence refers to a football play. In football, a team typically tries to score a touchdown by advancing the ball down the field, and they can do this by running or passing the ball or a combination of both. When a team is on offense and they are on or near the opponent's 40-yard line, they may choose to \"go for it\" on fourth down rather than punting the ball to the other team, which would give the other team possession of the ball. If a team chooses to go for it, they will try to score a touchdown, make a field goal, or turn the ball over to the other team, depending on the situation."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Malcolm Brogdon banked the shot in.\"", "answerKey": "yes", "model_answer": "No, the sentence \"Malcolm Brogdon banked the shot in\" is not plausible. \"Banking\" a shot in basketball means intentionally missing a shot, and it is not a common phrase used to describe a successful shot.

In basketball, the three-point line is 18 feet away from the basket, but it is not possible to shoot from outside the line itself since the line is a boundary marker to determine if a shot is considered a three-point shot. James Harden would have to be outside the court boundaries to shoot from that distance."}

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Tom Brady was safe at first.\"", "answerKey": "no", "model_answer": "It is plausible that the sentence \"Tom Brady was safe at first\" could be true, depending on the context of the sentence. If Tom Brady was a runner on a baseball team and was running towards a base, and if the fielding team caught the ball and touched the runner with the ball before he reached the base, then the runner would be considered \"out\". If the fielding team did not catch the ball and touch the runner with the ball before he reached the base, or if the runner was already on the base when the ball was caught, then the runner would be considered \"safe\".

Sergio Aguero is a famous Argentine footballer and the sentence might imply that he performed a skillful and impressive move during a game, similar to Diego Maradona, a former Argentine footballer known for his exceptional skills and creativity on the field. However, it is important to note that this is just an interpretation of the sentence and the meaning may vary depending on the context."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Gerrit Cole set the hard screen.\"", "answerKey": "no", "model_answer": "Yes, the sentence is plausible if you are referring to Gerrit Cole, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher, setting a hard screen for his teammates during a game."}

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Deshaun Watson was flagged on the play.\"", "answerKey": "yes", "model_answer": "Yes, the sentence is plausible. It suggests that Deshaun Watson, who is a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL), may have committed an offensive penalty during a game. Flags are typically waved by officials on the field to indicate a penalty or violation, so the sentence implies that a penalty may have been called against Watson during a game."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Tyler Glasnow watched the pitch go by.\"", "answerKey": "yes", "model_answer": "Yes, the sentence is plausible. Tyler Glasnow is a professional baseball player, and it is possible that he watched a pitch during a game. However, whether he actually did so cannot be confirmed without additional information."}

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Frederik Andersen converted the first down.\"", "answerKey": "no", "model_answer": "The sentence is plausible if Frederik Andersen is a professional football player who is playing in a game that uses the \"down\" system. In American football, a \"down\" is a unit of play that is determined when a play ends, and the team is required to either advance the ball or make a first down. If a team makes a first down, they have gained at least 10 yards and have the option to continue the play.

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Diego Forlan did a maradona on the defender.\"", "answerKey": "yes", "model_answer": "No, the sentence is not grammatically correct and the phrase \"did a Maradona on the defender\" is a slang term that means to cheat or trick someone, typically in a sports context. It is not appropriate to use this phrase in this context."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"George Springer committed a blocking foul.\"", "answerKey": "no", "model_answer": "No, it is not plausible to say that George Springer committed a blocking foul. George Springer is a professional baseball player who has primarily played as a left fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB).

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Kwadwo Asamoah beat the shot clock in the Eastern Conference Finals.\"", "answerKey": "no", "model_answer": "No, the sentence is not plausible. The shot clock is a device used in basketball to regulate the time allowed for a team to attempt a shot. It is not possible for a player to beat the shot clock in the context of a basketball game, as the shot clock is used to track the elapsed time between the last successful shot taken by a team and the subsequent inbounds pass. The Eastern Conference Finals is also not the appropriate context for a statement about a player attempting to beat a shot clock, as this is a gameplay aspect that occurs during regular-season games and is not relevant to the outcome of postseason games."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Kyle Tucker stepped on first base.\"", "answerKey": "yes", "model_answer": "It is plausible that Kyle Tucker stepped on first base, but without more context or information, it is impossible to know for sure whether this is true or not."}
