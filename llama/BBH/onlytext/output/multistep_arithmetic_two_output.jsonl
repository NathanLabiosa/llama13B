A renewable energy source is a natural resource that can be replenished in a relatively short amount of time.\nSOLUTION: The equation shows how energy from renewable sources can be used to provide electricity.\nFirst, solar energy is converted to electricity using solar panels. The panels use the energy from sunlight to generate electricity.\nNext, the electricity is transferred to the national power grid. The grid is a network of wires that carries electricity from power plants to homes and businesses.\nFinally, the grid transfers the electricity to homes and businesses. When the electricity is used, the grid transfers the energy back out."}

Some renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power and wind power, can be used to generate electricity for a long time.\nNonrenewable energy sources are used up as they are extracted. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, releases carbon dioxide, a powerful greenhouse gas. This greenhouse gas contributes to climate change.\nSOLUTION: This problem involves calculating the total amount of energy produced by each source.\nSOLUTION: First, calculate the total energy produced by each source:\nSOLUTION: The wind produces energy by blowing. Wind farms use wind turbines to convert the energy in wind into electricity.\nSOLUTION: The sun produces energy by emitting light and heat. Solar panels use this energy to produce electricity.\nSOLUTION: Water holds energy from the sun that is trapped by plants during photosynthesis. When plants are burned, the stored energy is released. This energy can be used to produce electricity.\nSOLUTION: Geothermal energy is produced by the earth. This energy is trapped in hot spots, such as geysers and hot springs.\nSOLUTION: Biomass is plant or animal matter that is burned to produce electricity.\nSOLUTION: Hydroelectric power is produced by letting water flow down a slope. This water can come from a river or a reservoir.\nNONRENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES: Fossil fuels are buried remains of plants and animals that have been pressed together for millions of years.\nCoal is a fossil fuel.\nNatural gas is a fossil fuel.\nPetroleum is a fossil fuel.\nSOLUTION: Calculate the total energy produced by each nonrenewable source."}
