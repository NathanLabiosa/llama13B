Some operations on Boolean values can be combined using Boolean operators.\nThe following operators are used with Boolean values:\nThe and operator combines two conditions to make both conditions true.\nThe or operator combines two conditions to make at least one of the conditions true.\nThe not operator changes a condition from True to False.\nThe not not operator changes a condition from False to True.\nAn example of an and operator is the statement:\nIf a person is in New York and working, then that person is working in New York.\nThis statement is true because the person is in New York and working.\nAn example of an or operator is the statement:\nIf a person is in New York or is working, then that person is either in New York or working.\nThis statement is true because the person is in New York or working.\nAn example of a not operator is the statement:\nIf a person is not in New York, then that person is not working in New York.\nThis statement is true because the person is not in New York.\nAn example of a not not operator is the statement:\nIf a person is not not in New York, then that person is in New York or working.\nThis statement is true because the person is not not in New York.\nSOLUTION: The statement is not not False is true. It is not the case that the person is not doing some work."}
{"question": "not False and False and True or False is", "answerKey": "False", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Non-renewable energy sources take millions of years to form. The sun heats up organic matter, such as plants and animals, that accumulate in sediments. The pressure of layers of sediment above the organic matter transforms the organic matter into fossil fuels.\nFossil fuels are a finite resource. They were formed over millions of years, and they will take millions of years to renew. We cannot replace the fossil fuels that we use.\nRenewable energy sources can be replenished naturally. Some renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, use the energy of the sun or the wind. Other renewable energy sources, such as biomass, hydro, and geothermal, use organic matter.\nSOLUTION: Non-renewable energy sources are formed in nature. They take millions of years to form and are a finite resource. We cannot replace the fossil fuels that we use.\nRenewable energy sources are replenished naturally. Some renewable energy sources use the energy of the sun or the wind. Other renewable energy sources use organic matter."}
{"question": "True or not False and ( False ) is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "Non-renewable energy sources take millions of years to form. We cannot replace the energy that we use from these sources. As a result, we cannot use non-renewable energy sources indefinitely.\nSOLUTION: Renewable energy sources are replenished naturally. We can use renewable energy sources indefinitely."}
{"question": "( not ( False ) ) or False is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Renewable energy sources and nonrenewable energy sources are both used to generate electricity.\nRenewable energy is energy that comes from natural resources that are replenished. Some renewable energy sources include wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.\nNonrenewable energy is energy that comes from resources that do not naturally replenish. Some nonrenewable energy sources include coal, oil, and natural gas.\nSOLUTION: Energy from the wind and sun are renewable energy sources.\nWind and solar power both use renewable energy to generate electricity."}
{"question": "True and not True or False and True is", "answerKey": "False", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Renewable energy is energy that comes from resources which are not depleted when used. Many renewable energy sources rely on natural processes that are repeated regularly, such as sunrise every day.\nSOLUTION: This statement is true.\nRenewable energy sources are more sustainable over the long term because they are replenished frequently. A finite resource, such as coal, will eventually be depleted and cannot be sustained."}
{"question": "not ( not not not not False ) is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Non-renewable energy sources are finite. This means that there is a limited amount of these energy sources on Earth.\nWhen non-renewable energy sources are used, they are gone forever. This type of energy use is not sustainable.\nSOLUTION: The key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources are the availability and sustainability of the energy sources.\nRenewable energy sources are renewable. This means that they can be replenished naturally. Renewable energy sources are a sustainable source of energy.\nNon-renewable energy sources are not renewable. This means that they are not sustainable. The use of non-renewable energy sources will eventually deplete the energy source."}
{"question": "True and ( not True or False ) is", "answerKey": "False", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Non-renewable energy sources take millions of years to form, and they are in limited supply. We can use them up relatively quickly.\nWhen we use non-renewable energy sources, we are spending our \"fossil fuel inheritance.\" Our fossil fuel inheritance is the energy stored in non-renewable resources that we have already found. This energy is not renewable, so it is up to us to use it wisely.\nRenewable energy sources can be replenished naturally. Some renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are called \"renewable\" because they can be used again and again.\nOther renewable energy sources, such as biomass, hydropower, and geothermal energy, are renewable because they can be replenished naturally. Biomass can be replenished by growing more crops or raising more livestock. Hydropower can be replenished by the tides or waves. Geothermal energy can be replenished by the heat of the Earth."}
{"question": "( not not not False or True ) is", "answerKey": "True", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Energy sources can be classified as renewable or nonrenewable.\nRenewable energy sources can be replenished naturally. Some renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are fueled by the sun. Other renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power and biomass, are fueled by the earth.\nNonrenewable energy sources cannot be replenished as quickly as they are used. Coal, oil, and natural gas are nonrenewable energy sources. These energy sources are formed in the earth over a long period of time.\nSOLUTION: To decide whether a energy source is renewable or nonrenewable, think about how the energy source is formed and how long it takes to form.\nA energy source is renewable if it is replenished naturally.\nA energy source is nonrenewable if it is not replenished naturally."}
