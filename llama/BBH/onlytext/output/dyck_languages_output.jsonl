Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas are examples of nonrenewable energy sources.\nSOLUTION: The table below compares renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.\nCharacteristic Renewable energy sources Nonrenewable energy sources\nAvailability Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible. Nonrenewable energy sources are finite.\nEnvironmental impact Renewable energy sources have a lower environmental impact. Nonrenewable energy sources can cause air and water pollution, and they are the primary source of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.\nCost Renewable energy sources can be more expensive to build. But over the long term, they have lower costs, because they don't need to be replaced as often as nonrenewable sources. Nonrenewable energy sources have to be extracted from the ground, which can be done with fewer resources if they are closer to the surface. But if they are deep underground, more resources will be needed to extract them. In addition, nonrenewable energy sources have to pay for the extraction and transport of the fuel.\nReliability Renewable energy sources are often more reliable. The sun rises and sets every day, and the wind blows intermittently. But these patterns are predictable. So, it is possible to predict how much energy will be generated by renewable sources. Nonrenewable energy sources can be relied on to produce a steady supply of energy, but they can't be used as much as they would like to, because they are running out.\nFlexibility Renewable energy sources are more flexible. For example, you can use more renewable energy if you build more solar panels or wind turbines. But you can't use more nonrenewable energy by using more of the fuel that powers your car. You can use more fuel, but that will just delay the day when the fuel runs out.\nSustainability Renewable energy sources"}

Energy can be transferred from place to place by waves, such as sound and water waves. Energy can also be moved from place to place by sending particles, such as electric or magnetic fields.\nSome energy sources are renewable. This means that they are replaced quickly enough to be used indefinitely. Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy.\nOther energy sources are nonrenewable. This means that they are not replaced as quickly as they are used. Nonrenewable energy sources include coal, oil, and natural gas.\nSOLUTION: Complete the sequence by deciding whether each energy source is renewable or nonrenewable.\nPotential energy is stored in objects. It can be transformed into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.\nSOLUTION: Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward the center of the earth. The height of an object above the ground is called its elevation.\nThink about an object on the ground. Gravity pulls the object toward the center of the earth. This movement is called a fall.\nIf the object is not pulled out of its fall, it will continue to move toward the center of the earth. The object will keep falling until it is one or two earth diameters below the ground.\nThis means that the potential energy of the object is equal to the weight of the object. The weight is the amount of resistance that the object provides to the force of gravity.\nSo, the potential energy of an object is equal to the weight of the object.\nIf the weight of an object is not changed, the potential energy of the object is not changed. So, a solid is a good insulator. It does not change the potential energy of a object that is on or near it.\nSOLUTION: A nonrenewable energy source is a resource that will not last forever.\nA fossil fuel is a nonrenewable energy source. Fossil fuels formed from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.\nHumans are using fossil fuels much more quickly than nature can make new ones. So, fossil fuels are not a sustainable resource.\nSOLUTION: An renewable energy source is a resource that can be replenished"}

Some renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, use the energy of the sun or the wind. Other renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power and geothermal power, use the energy of rivers and the earth, respectively.\nNon-renewable energy sources are formed over millions of years. Coal, oil, and natural gas are all non-renewable energy sources. Because non-renewable energy sources take so long to form, they are not replaced as quickly as we use them."}

Some sources of energy are renewable, which means that they can be used again and again. Other sources of energy are nonrenewable, which means that they cannot be used again after they are used up.\nRenewable energy sources can be replenished naturally. Some renewable energy sources include wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.\nNonrenewable energy sources are not renewed by nature. Fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) are nonrenewable energy sources.\nSOLUTION: The parentheses in the passage are not balanced. This means that some parentheses have been left open.\nThe passage has three unmatched parentheses. They are ( )."}

The wind and the sun are nature's energy sources.\nSome energy sources are non-renewable. This means that they are not replenished naturally. Non-renewable energy sources take a very long time to be replenished.\nCoal, oil, and natural gas are three examples of non-renewable energy sources.
