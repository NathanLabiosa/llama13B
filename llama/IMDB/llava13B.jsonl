Parker is given the story credit. Bottom line is Trem Carr and Paul Malvern bought it from Totman in 1931 and gave the Story credit to whoever wrote the screenplay on the two remakes, and writer Wellyn Totman loses two credits rightfully belonging to him. The 1938 remake subs the name \"Bob Mason\" for \"John Mason\"(in \"The Dawn Trail\") and all of the other main character names in \"Western Trails\" stayed the same. Check it out. The story has John Mason, after several seasons of punching cattle in Texas, coming back home to see his father,agent for the local freight line. He is not, as some summaries show, coming to town to avenge his father's death...his father ain't dead when he hits the city limits. On his way over to see his father, John bumps into Ben McClure, they have a fight, and Ben, a good-hearted fellow, decides the drinks are on him and he and John become fast friends in no time at all. John then decides to amble over to the freight office and call on his father, Dan Mason, and arrives in the midst of a hold-up and the elder Mason is killed. John pursues the robbers and is shot from his horse. Badly wounded, he is taken to his new best-friend's cabin, and is nursed back to health by Ben's sweetheart (although she doesn't know this), Alice Gordon and, as Totman's original story and Nosler's swipe would have it, John and Alice fall in love, especially after she saves his life from a gang headed by her brother, Rudd, who held up the freight station and killed Mason's father. None of which John knows. Recovered, he suspects Ben, who is already miffed because John has stolen his sweetheart, even if neither John nor Alice are aware of Ben's claim. Rudd challenges John to a duel in the street and Ben, plied with liquor supplied by Rudd and the gang member saloon owner, goes off and removes the cartridges from John's gun. John picks up his gun and heads for town. John is out in the street, with an empty gun, about to face Rudd, whose gun isn't empty. All three versions of Totman's original story---no matter who was given the remake credit---are among the best (a relative term) of the B-Western genre. Well, in the case of \"The Dawn Rider\", the reference is to the original B&W Lone Star version, and not to the awful colorized video version that, for some unknown reason, has dubbed voices and a completely unneeded---not to mention bad---musical track added.

Will she be stopped in time to save Laura's son, Bobby?", "Twelve Anglo-Saxon women who were members of the same sorority at St. Alban's Seminary have remained friends long after their days at the seminary. One person who did not remain friends with this group is half-caste Hindu Ursula Georgi, a woman who wanted to pass as white but was shunned by the group for her ethnicity. To get back at the group, Ursula, now working as the secretary for the renowned astrologist Swami Yogadachi, manages to get the women, through a series of round-robin letters, to ask the Swami to send each of them their horoscope. Regardless of the Swami's horoscope for each, Ursula instead sends them one of doom, often predicting their death or that of a loved one. The doomed predictions start to become self-fulfilling prophecies primarily through the mere suggestion, although Ursula does have some strong mystical powers of her own. The woman deemed to be the strongest of the group, single mother and Beverly Hills society matron Laura Stanhope, decides to gather the remaining group together as an act of defiance against the doomed predictions. What Laura does not tell her friends is that she too has fears about her horoscope, predicting the death of her son Bobby before his upcoming birthday in three days, especially after the Swami's prediction of a death not among the group does also come to pass. Knowing Laura's inner strength, Ursula takes some more direct measures to ensure the Swami's prediction for Bobby's death does happen. When Laura begins to realize that someone other than the Swami is really trying to kill Bobby, she turns to the police.

The belief among the scientific community at large is that the organisms are the result of disease and not the cause. This belief is despite the fact that thirty percent of women die in childbirth due to child bed disease, accounting for twenty thousand annual deaths in Paris alone. The debate takes Pasteur all the way to a meeting with Emperor Napoleon III and his physician, Dr. Charbonnet, who is one of the leading opponents of Pasteur.

Through a fluke he and his assistant discover that a weakened dose of rabies helps the human immune system create its own antibodies.

The London foreign office places great importance on Carpathia because of an unstable geopolitical situation with Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany set to overthrow its monarchy government if allowed. The Regent, a Prince originally from Hungary, and the most recent and now deceased Queen married for convenience. As such, the Regent has spent time with a series of lady friends while on his travels in his somewhat \"free\" state. In meeting one of those London women, music hall actress Maisie Springfield, and the company of her current production \"The Coconut Girl\", the Regent instead has his eyes set on one of the minor players in the show, American actress Elsie Marina.
