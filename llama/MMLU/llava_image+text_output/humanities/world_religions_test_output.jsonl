This anthropomorphic deity was imagined to have emotions, personal preferences, and a body.\nThe Presocratics did not deny the existence of a supreme deity, but they argued that the deity was not involved in the world. Instead, the deity was an impersonal force, like a natural principle.\nSOLUTION: The major shift by Greek philosophers who rejected the anthropomorphic view of the divine took place in the Fourth and Third Centuries BCE.\nDuring this time, philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus argued that the divine was not involved in the world. These philosophers believed that the divine was an impersonal force, such as a natural principle."}

This accountability is demonstrated through elections.\nFor centuries, people have fought and died for the right to vote. Voting is the most important thing you can do as a citizen. By voting, you can help choose representatives who make decisions in government.\nWhen you vote, you help choose the leaders of our country. But voting is also about choosing the values that those leaders will uphold.\nIn a democracy, people have different opinions. But a democracy is still a society of shared values. Some of these values are in the Constitution. Others are in the laws that make up the United States Code.\nSome of these values are based on the idea of democracy itself. For example, Americans believe that all people are created equal. This belief is so important that it is in the Constitution. Americans also believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. These beliefs are also in the Constitution.\nOther values are based on the history and experiences of the American people. For example, the government bans desecration of the flag because of how strongly Americans feel about the flag. The government bans burning or urinating on the flag because these things are seen as disrespectful.\nThe values of a democracy are not always the same as the values of other types of societies. For example, in a monarchy, the leader is not chosen by the people. In a monarchy, the leader is born into power."}
