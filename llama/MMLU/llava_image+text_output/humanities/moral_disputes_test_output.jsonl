The principles of just war theory identify the moral limits within which war can be fought.\nJus in bello is the name for the principles of just war theory that apply to the conduct of war. These principles regulate the use of violence in war, and they include the following:\nthe principle of discrimination, which requires that the violence used in war be directed at military targets rather than at civilians or civilian objects;\nthe principle of proportionality, which requires that the violence used in war not cause excessive harm in relation to the military objective sought;\nthe principle of necessity, which requires that the violence used in war be limited to what is necessary to achieve a military objective;\nthe principle of humanity, which requires that the Parties to a war take all possible measures to protect civilians and civilian objects from the effects of war; and\nthe principle of surrender, which requires that soldiers who are defeated or surrender be treated with respect for their fundamental rights.\nJus ad bellum is the name for the principles of just war theory that apply to the decision to go to war. These principles identify the moral limits of war, and they include the following:\nthe principle of self-defense, which allows a State to use force in self-defense against armed attack;\nthe principle of necessity, which requires that other means be exhausted before a State goes to war;\nthe principle of proportionality, which requires that the use of force in war not cause excessive harm; and\nthe principle of civilian immunity, which requires that civilians not be targeted by war.\nMoral nihilism is the belief that there is no morality, and that moral judgments are neither true nor false.

The problem of climate change is sometimes called a \"intergenerational storm\" because the bad effects of current carbon dioxide emissions will fall largely on future generations.\nThe compounding effects of greenhouse gas emissions make the problem worse: as the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the temperature will continue to rise. So, the current generation will need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions not only to help future generations but also to help the current generation.\nSOLUTION: The bad effects of climate change will fall largely on future generations. By burning fossil fuels, humans have released huge amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This has led to the warming of the Earth's surface, the melting of snow and ice, and the rising of sea levels.

For example, a government official might want to spend more money on national defense. But if the official spends too much money on defense, there might not be enough money for other important programs, such as education.\nSo, when is a decision 'important' for the purposes of this unit? When it involves trade-offs.\nA decision involves trade-offs when choosing one thing involves giving up on or reducing something else.

Philosophers attempt to understand the nature of good and bad, right and wrong, and beauty and ugliness.\nThe value of a thing is what makes it preferable. A value is a judgment about what is desirable.\nAn ethical value is a value that has to do with how people should treat themselves and others. The question of whether a particular behavior is right or wrong is a question about whether it is in accord with ethical values.\nThe terms right and wrong are used to describe how a particular choice or action aligns with ethical values. Something is right if it is in accord with ethical values. Something is wrong if it is not.\nA philosophical explanation is a careful, well-reasoned argument. A satisfactory philosophical explanation is one that shows that a claim is true.\nSOLUTION: Leon Kass thinks the notion of being \"better off dead\" is incoherent because, he claims, death is undesirable. In other words, Kass believes that the fact that something is dead makes it worse off.\nAccording to Kass, the notion of something being better off dead is incoherent because death is, by definition, undesirable.

Virtue ethics is concerned with how individuals should live their lives.\nAn important virtue is decent. Decent people are considerate of others, take responsibility for their own lives, and do not try to manipulate others.\nA virtue ethics approach to business might well lead to the conclusion that a company should act in a decent way. For example, a company should tell the truth about its products, pay its employees a fair wage, and not pollute the environment.\nSOLUTION: An advocate of care ethics would agree that traditional moral theories have difficulty explaining the rightness or wrongness of attitudes. But care ethics goes further in arguing that traditional moral theories focus too much on moral rules and not enough on caring relationships.\nCare ethics is an important development of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics has long emphasized that character is important. Care ethics takes this emphasis further by arguing that the caring practices of others are what build character.\nCare ethics is not alone in arguing that the only important moral concepts are care and compassion. But care ethics is unusual in its insistence that these concepts are the only important moral concepts.\nAccording to care ethics, we should think about welfare and happiness in terms of sympathy. The care ethics view is that the welfare and happiness of individuals is most effectively promoted when those individuals are cared about in a sympathetic manner."}

Consequentialist considerations focus on the effects of actions. An action is considered right if it has good consequences, and wrong if it has bad consequences.

The court said that an appellate court must review capital cases as if it were sitting in the trial court. The appellate court must consider all the evidence and make its own decision about whether the defendant is guilty of the capital offense.\nSOLUTION: The overall percentage of capital cases that are overturned because of serious errors is 68 percent."}

She defines sexual objectification as a state in which an individual is seen as a mere object of sexual desire, with all the concomitant loss of dignity and autonomy that this entails.\nNussbaum claims that there are many ways to treat a person as an object. One is to treat her as a sexual object. Another is to treat her as an object of pity. A third is to treat her as an object of awe. And so on. But, according to Nussbaum, all of these ways of objectifying a person share a common structure. To objectify a person is to treat her as a thing, as an object that can be used or touched or manipulated without regard for her own perspective or needs."}

In this way of thinking, the earth is not a commodity to be exploited, but a community to be nurtured.\nThe term biocentrism is not much older than the 1970s, but it has roots in the ancient world. For instance, the Stoics of the first century CE believed that the universe was a living organism, with human beings as a part of it.\nBiomass, biosphere, bioethics, and other terms that begin with the prefix bio- suggest that living beings are the subject of importance. Consequently, a biocentric approach to environmental ethics gives priority to the well-being of living beings, including humans.\nSOLUTION: The question asks you to identify the view that biocentrism holds. The only beings that possess direct moral standing are human beings. is a view of anthropocentrism, not biocentrism. Anthropocentrism is the view that non-human living beings have value only insofar as they benefit human beings.\nAll and only sentient creatures have direct moral standing. is a view of biocentrism. Sentient beings have the ability to feel. So, according to this view, the only beings that have direct moral standing are living beings that can feel.\nAll living beings, because they are living, possess direct moral standing. is a view of biocentrism. Living beings are more than just alive. They are also part of a community of living beings.\nThe primary bearers of direct moral standing are ecosystems in virtue of their functional integrity. is not a view of biocentrism. An ecosystem is not a being. So, an ecosystem cannot be the primary bearer of direct moral standing."}

Rather, they are based on an agreement between the rulers and the ruled.\nThe social contract is a hypothetical agreement that explains how and why people come to be governed. This contract is not actually signed.

The administrators may be focused on the speakers' past statements, which they see as proof of the speakers' racism or bigotry. However, this focus on past statements may cause the administrators to ignore the speakers' other qualities, such as their accomplishments in other areas. By doing so, the administrators are failing to look at the speakers holistically.\nHistorical perspective: In the past, the American government has disinvited speakers from college campuses. In the 1950 s, for example, many colleges and universities disinvited speakers who were communist sympathizers. (At that time, such people were often seen as threatening to American values.) The disinvitations were controversial, but they were not necessarily a violation of the principle of free speech. The speakers were still able to give their speeches; they just weren't able to do so on college campuses.\nSo, the disinvitation of certain speakers may be a violation of the principle of free speech. But it is also an example of mental filtering. By focusing on the speakers' past statements, college administrators are seeing only part of the picture."}

Some of the most common types are listed below.\nSome anti-homosexuality arguments are based on the idea that homosexuality is unnatural. These arguments claim that homosexuality is not found in nature or that it is wrong to engage in sexual behavior that is not open to procreation.\nSome anti-homosexuality arguments are based on the idea that homosexuality is immoral. These arguments claim that homosexuality is immoral because it goes against the rules of a particular religion or because it is not in line with traditional moral values.\nSome anti-homosexuality arguments are based on the idea that homosexuality is a choice. These arguments claim that individuals choose to be homosexual, and that being homosexual is somehow worse than being heterosexual.\nSome anti-homosexuality arguments are based on the idea that homosexuality is harmful.

Many philosophers believe that having duties to respect the human rights of others is what makes actions right. These duties are protective of the rights of individuals and groups. They are universal, in that they apply to everyone.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nThe test of whether or not legal and economic structures are minimally just is whether or not they recognize, enforce, and implement duties not to violate human rights. This applies to all groups and individuals.\nAshford believes that a just society is a society that has a certain type of legal and economic structure. This type of structure, which includes the right institutions and incentives, allows people to use their capabilities to lead lives they value. However, these institutions and incentives must also recognize, enforce, and implement duties not to violate human rights.\nFor example, if an institution or incentive violates someone's human rights, it is not part of a minimally just society. For example, slavery is a violation of human rights. It is not just because it is economically inefficient."}

In other words, beings with moral standing are beings that can have good or bad experiences.\nMoral permissibility is a concept that is used in ethics to decide whether something is morally right or wrong.\nAn action is morally permissible if it can be done without wronging anyone.\nA being is viable if it is able to survive or live. In other words, viability is about the ability to live.\nViability is important when you are deciding what to do with a being that is alive but not yet born.\nSOLUTION: To have moral standing, a person or thing must have the ability to suffer or to enjoy. So, by having moral standing, a person or thing counts morally.\nMoral permissibility means that something is not wrong. So, if a person or thing has moral standing, it is also morally permissible.\nViability means that something is able to survive or live. But viability does not necessarily mean that something has moral standing. A being that is not yet born is viable if it is able to survive or live.

Your argument might look something like this:\nJill is always late for work.\nThe only way to explain this behavior is to assume that Jill believes that being on time for work is not important.\nTherefore, Jill believes that being on time for work is not important.\nAn explanation is the best guess of the causes of a behavior. In order to be the best guess, an explanation must make the behavior sound reasonable. In the example above, the explanation sounds reasonable because there are many possible reasons why Jill might believe that being on time for work is not important. For example, Jill might believe that her work will not fire her if she is late, or Jill might be a highly organized person who is always on time to everything else in her life.\nAnother way to argue that someone believes a claim is to use modus ponens. For example, you can argue that Jill believes that being on time for work is not important using this argument:\nJill is always late for work.\nBeing on time for work is important.\nTherefore, Jill believes that being on time for work is important.\nThis argument applies modus ponens. This rule says that if something is true and you know that something else is true, then you know that the something else is true. In this argument, you know that Jill is always late for work and that being on time for work is important. So, the something else that you know is true is that Jill believes that being on time for work is important.\nSOLUTION: The question says that Timmons suggests that people believe in moral relativism because of four reasons.

In recent years, however, new treatments have come into use that can improve people's abilities or enhance their normal functions. These treatments are called medical enhancements.\nSome people think that medical enhancements are just another type of medical treatment. But others think that there is a moral difference between medical treatments and medical enhancements.\nThis difference is related to the idea of what makes a person's life go well. Some people think that a person's life goes well when they have good health. Other people think that a person's life goes well when they have good health and can live a life that is as good as possible.\nThe difference between these two ideas is the difference between two views of what makes a person's life go well. One view is that a person's life goes well when they have good health. The other view is that a person's life goes well when they have good health and can live a life that is as good as possible.\nThese two views can lead to different ways of thinking about medical treatments and medical enhancements.\nSuppose that a medical treatment can make a person's life go better by helping them to have good health. This treatment is just a medical treatment.\nSuppose that a medical enhancement can make a person's life go better by helping them to live a life that is as good as possible. This enhancement is not just a medical treatment. It is a medical enhancement.\nSome people think that there is no moral difference between treatments and enhancements. But Kamm argues that there is a moral difference between them.\nKamm claims that Sandel's moral distinction between treatment and enhancement assumes that nature is sacred and should be honored.

These assumptions are often hidden within the argument, but they can have a big impact on the logic of the argument.\nAn assumption is a statement that is taken for granted. An argument assumes that the claims made in the premises are true. An argument may also assume that the claims made in the premises are the only possible true claims.\nWhen an argument assumes something, it usually does so implicitly. So, when you are evaluating an argument, you need to identify the assumptions that are implicit in the argument.\nAn argument may have only one assumption, or it may have several. An argument may also have an assumption that is implied by one of the premises.\nAn assumption can be supported by a premise, or it may be left unsupported. If an assumption is not supported by a premise, it is a gap in the argument.\nAn argument may have a gap in its reasoning, or it may assume a claim that is contrary to one of the premises.

A sound argument has all of the following qualities:\nIt is valid.\nIt is not unsound.\nIt has all the required assumptions.\nIt has all the required premises.\nWhen an argument is valid, it means that the argument follows from its premises. If the premises are true, the argument's claim is true.\nWhen an argument is not unsound, it means that the argument does not have any gaps in its reasoning.

He wrote many important papers on philosophy, but his most famous work is a book called Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. In this book, Kant argues that the only moral laws that are universal and unconditional are the ones that are based on the concept of duty.\nKant believes that a duty is something that you ought to do, no matter what you desire. To determine whether something is a duty, you ought to ask yourself whether you could want it to be a universal law. If you could want it to be a universal law, then it is a duty.\nKant offers the following formulation of the categorical imperative:\n\"Act in such a way that you could want the principle of your action to become a universal law.\"\nThis means that you should consider how your actions would affect other people. Would you want everyone to follow this same rule? If so, then it is a duty.\nSOLUTION: Promoting the ends of others is a key part of Kant's concept of duty. So, the goal of promoting the ends of others is a very general goal that satisfies Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative.\nSelf-sacrifice is the opposite of promoting the ends of others. So, self-sacrifice is not a very general goal that satisfies Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative.\nProducing happiness is not a very general goal that satisfies Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative. Happiness is not always the same as promoting the ends of others.\nIncreasing welfare is not a very general goal that satisfies Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative. Welfare is not always the same as promoting the ends of others.\nSelf-perfection is not a very general goal that satisfies Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative.

In oral arguments, justices question the parties to a case and their lawyers. The questions can be tough, and sometimes justices don't agree. But oral arguments can also show how well a claim holds up.\nThe quality of a claim is important. A weak claim can hurt a party's chances of winning. But even a strong claim can be hurt by a weak response. So, it's important to use evidence and reasoning in responding to questions.\nSOLUTION: The statement that doctors are as qualified as any other mature adult to decide whether a life is worth living is a claim. It can be tested by questions.\nOn the one hand, doctors are trained to evaluate patients' lives. They have the medical expertise to decide what a patient can expect from his or her condition. So, doctors are qualified to make such decisions.\nOn the other hand, being a mature adult does not necessarily make someone qualified to decide whether another person's life is worth living. A mature adult is not necessarily an expert in medicine. So, the second part of the statement is not necessarily true.\nThe argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors is not a statement. It is an argument. An argument is a claim that one or more statements are true. This argument claims that the proposal was made by doctors. But the fact that the proposal was made by doctors does not necessarily mean that the argument is true.\nThe law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis is a statement.

The economic interest of loggers to cut now is underlain by the impersonal interests of their children to live in a forest of maximum value. The economic interest of hunters to hunt now is underlain by the impersonal interests of wildlife and other hunters to live in a forest of maximum value.\nForest ecosystems have four basic variables: predators, prey, parasites, and pathogens. Any three of these four can be mutually supportive; the fifth is in conflict with the first four.\nA deer herd is a predator, and a pathogen. They prey on understory plants, and their surplus numbers cause forest change.\nA pathogen is also a parasite. It feeds on the living tissue of its host.\nA parasite is also a predator. It feeds on other organisms.\nA predator is also a pathogen. It feeds on other organisms.\nA healthy ecosystem is one in which each of the four variables is held to a somewhat narrow range by the others.\nFor example, when predators are scarce, they eat fewer prey. So, in a healthy ecosystem, there are few surplus predators.\nWhen surplus predators eat so many prey that the prey population is reduced, the pathogens that feed on the prey are also affected. So, in a healthy ecosystem, there are also few surplus pathogens.\nWhen surplus pathogens cause the death of some hosts, the parasites that feed on those hosts are also affected. So, in a healthy ecosystem, there are also few surplus parasites.\nAnd when surplus parasites feed on so many hosts that the hosts are reduced in number, the predators that feed on those hosts are also affected. So, in a healthy ecosystem, there are also few surplus predators.\nIn a conservation system based wholly on economic motives, the four impersonal interests are collapsed into one: the interest of some economic group in getting some resource.\nThis approach overlooks the fact that the four variables have different ways of affecting one another. For example, if there are too many predators, the pathogens that feed on the predators are not affected. But if there are too many prey, the pathogens that feed on the prey are not affected.\nA conservation system based on economic motives also assumes that the economic parts of the biotic system will function without the uneconomic parts.\nFor example, the soil is an essential part of the biotic system, but it is not economic. It does not produce resources that can be harvested for sale.\nSo, a conservation system based wholly on economic motives is a narrow and short-term approach that cannot conserve the biotic system."}

If this were true, it might make sense to eat meat. But it is not. Animals do have feelings and emotions.\nAnother argument is that eating meat is okay because humans are at the top of the food chain. This argument comes from the idea that all other organisms are made to serve humans. This point of view is not ecologically accurate.

It involves becoming aware of negative thoughts and behaviors, testing the validity of negative assumptions, and replacing negative thoughts and behaviors with positive ones.\nExamples of negative thoughts and behaviors include blaming others, being overly self-critical, or being unable to express oneself assertively.\nBecoming aware of negative thoughts and behaviors is the first step in changing them. You can do this by observing your thoughts and behaviors during therapy sessions and in your daily life.\nTesting the validity of negative assumptions involves looking for evidence that supports or refutes them. For example, a negative assumption may be that \"I'm not able to do anything right.\" Testing the validity of this assumption involves looking for times when you have done things right.\nReplacing negative thoughts and behaviors with positive ones involves coming up with more accurate and helpful ways of thinking and behaving. For example, instead of being overly self-critical, you might try to be more self-compassionate.\nSOLUTION: The goal of cognitive-behavioral therapy is to build grit.\nGrit is the ability to keep going after a goal, even when the going gets tough.\nGrit involves both persistence and resilience.\nPersistence is the ability to stay on track, even when encountering obstacles. Resilience is the ability to bounce back when setbacks occur."}

The conclusion is that liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees. This conclusion is not in the form of a direct verdict. So, you need to determine the main argument that supports this conclusion.\nThe key to finding the main argument is to look for the sentence or sentences that respond to the question of what liberal egalitarianism is. These sentences come after the conclusion and are in the form of a digression.\nEgalitarianism is founded on sentiments of envy and is therefore unjustified.\nLiberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism do not succeed.\nAnticosmopolitanism is the view that the nation should be composed of a single, homogeneous group.

Rather, the person who takes more risks is simply less concerned about their own safety than the person who takes fewer risks.\nHuemer argues that there is no reason to think that the harms of drug use are in an important sense different from the harms of other legally permitted harmful activities. All such activities are legal, and so, in a sense, they are all equally permitted. But they are not all equally dangerous.\nTaking more risks is a matter of indifference; it is not necessarily more admirable than taking fewer risks. But it is no more admirable than eating more food or drinking more water. In other words, doing something because one is less concerned about the risks involved is not necessarily more admirable than doing something because one is more concerned about the risks involved."}

So, what makes a punishment justified on a theory of justice? A justified punishment must be proportionate to the harm caused by the wrongdoing.\nProportionality is a key concept here. Proportionality requires that the punishment be similar in scale to the harm caused by the wrongdoing.\nMost theorists think that the punishment must be worse than the harm caused by the wrongdoing. The punishment must be significant enough to serve as a deterrent to others who are considering committing the same wrongdoing.\nSome theorists believe that the punishment must be even worse than the harm caused by the wrongdoing. These theorists think that the punishment must be severe enough to be a just retribution for the wrongdoing.\nSOLUTION: Metz believes that the only justifiable punishments are those that are harmful or unfriendly. These are the only types of punishment that are proportionate to the harm caused by the wrongdoing.\nDegradation is not a type of punishment that is proportionate to the degrading impacts of the wrongdoing. Degradation is a type of punishment that is aimed at making the wrongdoer worse than he or she was before. So, degradation is not proportionate to the harm caused by the wrongdoing."}

When an argument or claim is based on research, it is important to consider the following:\nthe type of research that was done\nthe methods used to conduct the research\nthe results of the research\nthe sources of the research\nWhen you are evaluating a claim that is based on research, you need to consider the type of research that was done. Some types of research are stronger than others. For example, experiments are usually more persuasive than surveys.

The theory posits that a lawbreaker should be punished only if punishment would have positive consequences.\nThere are several different versions of consequentialist theories of punishment. Some consequentialist theories focus on the potential benefits of punishment to the punisher. According to these theories, punishment is justified if it reduces crime or prevents repeat offenses. Other consequentialist theories focus on the potential benefits of punishment to the victim or to society. According to these theories, punishment is justified if it makes the victim or society better off.\nA theory of punishment cannot be based on the mere fact that punishment feels just or good to the punisher. Nor can a theory be based on the fact that a particular punishment is required by tradition or authorized by a legal system. Instead, the theory must claim that punishment has specific benefits.\nSOLUTION: To determine which conditions a lawbreaker must satisfy according to consequentialist theories of punishment, look at the choices.\nChoice \"the punishment is proportional to the wrongness of the crime.\": It is a condition of consequentialist theories of punishment that the punishment be proportional to the wrongness of the crime. Proportionality implies that the severity of the punishment should be related to the severity of the crime.\nChoice \"the punishment would likely produce as much overall intrinsic value as would any other alternative punishment.\": A theory of punishment based on consequentialist principles must focus on the consequences of punishment. An alternative punishment would be equally justified if it would produce the same overall consequences as the punishment.\nChoice \"the punishment is consistent with treating the person as an end in herself.\": This choice is not necessarily true. A consequentialist theory of punishment does not necessarily require that the punishment be consistent with treating the person as an end in herself.\nChoice \"the punishment is proportional to the wrongness of the crime.\": This choice is necessary for the punishment to be justified according to consequentialist principles."}

A countercharge is a response to a charge that accuses the other side of wrongdoing. For example, a argument might charge that a certain policy is unfair to students, and a countercharge might respond that the policy is actually necessary for fairness to students.\nIn any discussion, you should try to identify the charges and countercharges that are relevant to the question at hand. Being able to do this will help you see the issues at stake and evaluate the reasoning behind the argument.\nWhen you are charged with something, it is often helpful to respond in one of two ways. You can admit the charge and argue that it does not matter, or you can deny the charge and argue that it is not true.\nFor example, if you are charged with being too broke to afford the concert, you might argue that you can still go to the concert and have fun without spending much money. Or, if you are charged with being too drunk to drive, you might argue that you are not actually drunk.\nOn the other hand, if you are denied a loan by a bank, you might argue that you will be able to repay the loan. Or, if you are denied a visa, you might argue that you will not abuse the privilege of visiting the country.\nSOLUTION: To decide which steps are necessary for establishing a charge of unnaturalness, consider the different ways in which a charge can be established.\nThe first way a charge can be established is by offering a specific definition of the charge and showing why the charge matters. This is the strategy Corvino is using.\nThe second way a charge can be established is by offering evidence that supports the charge. For example, if the charge is that a certain policy is unfair, evidence that the policy is biased or discriminatory could be offered.\nThe third way a charge can be established is by drawing an obvious conclusion from the charge. For example, if the charge is that a certain financial investment is risky, it might be concluded that the investment could lose value.\nThe fourth way a charge can be established is by citing a specific source that offers evidence for the charge. For example, a scientist might cite a study that shows that a certain chemical is harmful.\nThe countercharge of choice fails to do any of these things. It does not specify exactly what is meant by unnaturalness or why that matter morally. It does not establish that people have a choice about their sexual orientation. And it does not explain why being gay is intrinsically self-destructive."}

Other claims are contingent, meaning that they are true in some circumstances but not in others.\nImagine that there is a claim that candy tastes sweet. This claim is universal. If you try it, you will find that it is always sweet.\nNow imagine that there is a claim that eating candy will make your children happy. This claim is contingent. Whether it is true depends on whether your children are hungry or have allergies.\nNot all claims are universal or contingent, however. Some claims are normative, which means that they express what a person believes is right or wrong, good or bad, or just or unjust. Normative claims often involve matters of personal or cultural preference.\nImagine that there is a claim that Americans should eat more vegetables. This claim is normative. Whether this claim is true depends on what a person believes is good for you.\nAnother claim is that it is impossible to treat people in light of their humanity in all circumstances. This claim is normative. Different people have different ideas about what it means to treat others in light of their humanity.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether there is a universal law of attraction, consider the following. Some people believe that there is a universal law of attraction, and that it is the force that draws people together. Other people do not believe that there is a universal law of attraction, and that it is instead a matter of personal preference.\nKant argues that because sexual attraction involves seeing another person as the object of one's appetites, the moral relationship with that person becomes impaired. This claim is normative. It reflects Kant's moral belief that people should not see other people as objects.\nThere is a universal law of attraction.\nThere is a universal law of attraction that says that every object is attracted to every other object. But this law does not say that people cannot help being attracted to other people."}

To answer the critic, you need to identify the flaw the critic is describing.\nUtilitarianism is based on the principle of utility, which states that the best action is the one that promotes the greatest amount of overall well-being. But not all actions involve promoting overall well-being. Critics argue that many actions are done for other reasons, such as having fun, getting rich, or keeping a promise. These are not necessarily reasons to promote overall well-being.\nTo answer the question, you need to determine whether the principle of utility is too demanding. The principle of utility demands that we always promote overall well-being. This is a high standard. If the principle of utility is too demanding, then it is a common objection to utilitarianism."}

The harmful attitude expressed by hate speech can be a causal antecedent to the expressive harm.\nAnother way to look at expressive harm is that it is the harm that results from the communication of hate speech. Hate speech can be harmful because it communicates an attitude that is harmful to others.\nFor example, a racist comment can harm a person's reputation by communicating an attitude that is harmful to people of that race.\nA causal consequence of hate speech is the harm that results from the actions that follow from hate speech. Hate speech can cause harm by motivating people to act on the harmful attitude expressed by the hate speech.\nFor example, a racist comment can lead to social exclusion by motivating people to act on the attitude that people of a certain race are not welcome."}

The book is a collection of essays on land use, conservation, and the environment. In these essays, Leopold develops his unique vision of the human relationship to the land.\nOne of Leopold's central ideas is that the problems associated with how we use the natural environment are not merely economic problems. They are not. Even if we could somehow calculate the economic value of every part of the environment, that would not ensure its proper use. This is because the problems we face are not just about the environment. They are also about how we should treat each other.\nFor example, consider a clear-cut logging operation. Cutting down the trees is a purely economic decision. But the real problem is not the trees. The real problem is that the decision is made without regard for the social and environmental consequences. The decision is made as if the environment were merely an economic resource. But the environment is not. It is a living system that supports life.\nSo, clearly, Leopold would not accept the claim that we should ignore all economic motives in deciding questions about land use. We cannot ignore the economic motives; we must understand them and use that understanding to decide how to use the environment in a way that is fair and balanced.\nThe problems associated with how we should use our natural environment ultimately concern how human beings should treat each other. We cannot solve these problems by thinking only about the environment. We must also think about the people who live in it.\nWe should think in terms of \"the balance of nature\" to properly appreciate the value of the natural environment. The phrase \"the balance of nature\" suggests a state of balance among all the parts of the environment. This is an important idea, but it is not the complete picture.\nThe problems associated with how we should use our natural environment are not merely economic problems. They are not. But they are not just environmental problems, either. They are problems about how we should treat each other."}

Some of the arguments for and against the death penalty focus on whether the death penalty is an effective deterrent to murder. Others argue that the death penalty is an ineffective way to deter murder, and that it is also an abuse of government power that amounts to the state committing premeditated murder.\nIn the United States, the death penalty is authorized by the federal government and imposed in some states. However, the use of the death penalty has not been supported by evidence that it is an effective deterrent to murder. For example, many murders are committed without premeditation, and the possibility of a death sentence is unlikely to deter someone in that situation. In addition, murder rates are not necessarily higher in states with the death penalty than in states without it.\nSome people argue that the death penalty is a more effective deterrent to murder than long prison terms. However, there is little evidence that the death penalty is a more effective deterrent. For example, the death penalty is not necessarily a stronger deterrent than life in prison without parole. And even if it were, the death penalty is not an effective way to deter murders elsewhere in the world that are not committed by Americans.\nFinally, some people argue that the death penalty is a necessary response to the murders it aims to deter. However, this argument is inconsistent with the fact that the death penalty has not been supported by evidence that it is an effective deterrent to murder."}

An argument should address the following questions:\nWhat is the author's position?\nWhat evidence does the author use to support his or her position?\nWhy is this evidence relevant?\nSome views are based on evidence, but others are not.\nA non-evidence-based view is a view that is not explained by the author's evidence. It is a view that the author simply states.\nAn evidence-based view is a view that is explained by the author's evidence. It is a view that the author explains by referencing specific evidence.\nSOLUTION: Dershowitz argues that torture warrants should be part of a legal system regulating the practice of torture. This view is expressed in the following statement by Dershowitz: \"Torture warrants should be issued by a judge, in the same way that search warrants are issued. A government official should have to convince a neutral judge that torture is necessary to prevent a terrorist attack.\" This view is part of Dershowitz's argument that torture can be made lawful.\nDershowitz also argues that no democratic society should allow public officials to engage in illegal actions \"off the books.\" This view is supported by the following statement by Dershowitz: \"Public officials cannot defend their illegal actions by claiming they were necessary to prevent a ticking bomb. If they do, they have claimed that the ends justify the means\u2014and that, in a democracy, is not a permissible argument.\" This view is not explained by Dershowitz's evidence; it is simply stated. So, this view is a non-evidence-based view.\nDershowitz does not argue that torture is permissible in the \"ticking bomb\" case. He does not provide evidence for the view that torture is permissible in this case. So, this view is not explained by Dershowitz's evidence. It is a non-evidence-based view."}

Here are some ways that people's positions on issues can be described:\nLiberal. Someone who takes a liberal position on an issue tends to be open to new ideas and change. They may be for change, even if it involves some risk.\nConservative. Someone who takes a conservative position on an issue tends to be traditional and cautious. They may be against change, even if it involves some risk.\nEvangelical. An evangelical position is typically conservative. It is based on the belief that the Bible is completely true. An evangelical may be against any issue that they think goes against the Bible.\nSecular. A secular position is not based on religious or spiritual values. This type of position may be for or against an issue, but it is not based on religious or spiritual values.\nSOLUTION: The passage says that Macedo describes his position on immigration as politically conservative. This means that Macedo tends to be traditional and cautious. He may be against change, even if it involves some risk."}

While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:\nIdeas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?\nOrganization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?\nVoice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?\nSentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?\nWord choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?\nGrammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?\nSOLUTION: Papadaki argues that the narrow view of sexual objectification is problematic because it fails to account for cases where there can be unintentional disregard of a person's humanity. Papadaki uses the term objectification to describe the act of treating a person as a thing, and argues that it is not always the case that the person being objectified is a woman and the person doing the objectifying is a man. However, when objectification does involve the use of sexuality, it is usually women who are sexualized, and men who do the sexualizing.\nChoice \"fails to account for cases of benign or positive objectification\" is incorrect. Papadaki's argument does not claim that objectification can never be benign or positive. Instead, Papadaki argues that objectification is always a problem, even when it is not necessarily the result of a man's look at a woman's body.\nChoice \"fails to account for cases where there can be unintentional disregard of a person's humanity\" is correct. Papadaki argues that objectification can be unintentional. This view is consistent with the idea that objectification involves the way a person treats a body, not the body itself.\nChoice \"is correct\" is incorrect. The correct answer is B."}

When two people have sex, their cells mix. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into a fetus.\nMost plants and animals use sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction helps ensure that offspring have a mix of genetic material. This can give offspring an advantage in an uncertain environment.\nCloning is a way to reproduce that does not involve fertilization. In cloning, the copy is genetically identical to the original organism.\nThere are two types of cloning. In somatic cell cloning, a copy of a body cell is made. In germ cell cloning, a copy of a reproductive cell is made.\nCloning can be done by a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer. In this process, the nucleus of a body cell is placed into an egg that has had its own nucleus removed. The egg then grows into a fetus.\nThis image shows somatic cell nuclear transfer.\nSOLUTION: An individual who is a product of normal sexual reproduction has genetic material primarily from two people. This individual's cells include genetic material from their father and mother.\nAn SCNT individual has genetic material primarily from one person. The SCNT individual's cells include genetic material that is a copy of the nucleus of a body cell from the person who was cloned."}

She suggests that we think about the abortion issue in terms of degrees and layers. Degrees refer to the different levels of a trait. Layers refer to the different aspects of a trait.\nFor example, consider the trait of being pregnant. The degree of being more pregnant is less pregnant.

When you are evaluating a writer's argument, you need to look at both the claim and the evidence.\nThe claim is the main point the writer is making. It is usually the first sentence of a paragraph or section.\nThe evidence is the information the writer uses to support the claim.\nThe analysis is the writer's discussion of the evidence and its relationship to the claim.\nIt is important to note that the claim, evidence, and analysis must be connected. The evidence should directly support the claim, and the analysis should explain how the evidence supports the claim.\nSOLUTION: The difference between combatants and noncombatants is a matter of degree. This claim can be supported by analysis of the difference between military and civilian populations in a conflict. Valls argues that the difference between combatants and noncombatants is a matter of degree: those who choose to fight may be granted greater protections than those who do not."}

They transition students from high school to the workforce. They transition students from their parent's home to an independent life. And, they transition students from dependence on their instincts and impulses to self-regulation and management of their behavior.\nTo make this transition, students need to develop the skills of self-regulation. Self-regulation includes critical thinking, which involves evaluating ideas and claims. It also includes reflective thinking, which involves questioning and reexamining one's own beliefs and assumptions.\nSOLUTION: The text argues that colleges and universities now encourage emotional reasoning instead of critical and reflective reasoning. Emotional reasoning means that people decide what to do based on their feelings. Instead, people should make decisions based on evidence and careful reasoning."}

Virtues are habits of acting for the right reason in the right way.\nAristotle argues that virtues are central to living a good life. Virtues are not just about following rules or avoiding bad behavior. Instead, virtues help you deliberately and consistently pursue a good life.\nAristotle describes three types of virtues: intellectual, character, and social.\nIntellectual virtues are habits that involve learning and understanding. Intellectual virtues include wisdom, prudence, and curiosity.\nCharacter virtues are habits that involve responding well to challenges and bad situations. Character virtues include courage, temperance, and justice.\nSocial virtues are habits that involve interacting well with others. Social virtues include friendship, generosity, and magnanimity.\nSOLUTION: The ability to control one's anger is a character virtue. It involves responding well to a challenge (angry situations).\nA disposition to avoid extremes in feeling and action is a character virtue. It involves responding well to a challenge (feelings of envy or anger).\nIntellectual knowledge is not a virtue. It involves understanding the world.\nThe capacity to ascertain what God would desire is not a virtue. It involves religious belief."}

For example, a harm argument might argue that harming others is always wrong.\nA possible counter to a harm argument is to point out a hidden assumption in the harm argument. A hidden assumption is an idea that the harm argument depends on but does not expressly state. If you can identify a hidden assumption, you might be able to argue that the harm argument is not valid.\nFor example, consider the following harm argument:\nPracticing medicine is sometimes risky. Not practicing medicine is not risky. So, practicing medicine is morally required.\nA counter to this harm argument is that there are possible worlds in which the only way to make no mistakes is to do nothing. In those worlds, practicing medicine is not morally required. This counter shows that the harm argument depends on a hidden assumption, which is that making mistakes is always wrong.\nAnother possible hidden assumption is that the right thing to do is always the safest thing to do. This hidden assumption is not expressed in the harm argument, but it is a common assumption. If this hidden assumption is not true, the harm argument is not valid."}
