{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAll this while the Indians came skulking about them, and would sometimes show themselves aloof off, but when any approached near them, they would run away; and once they stole away their tools where they had been at work and were gone to dinner. But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them.

They believed that Christianity would help Native Americans escape the \"barbarous\" ways of their culture and become more like \"civilized\" Europeans.\nThe missionary organization of the colony could not proceed upon any plan. The ministers and people were left to surmise what they ought to do. Some were willing to spend their time in teaching the Indian language, writing, and reading; others thought it best to apply to the Indians in their own way. There were some who were not afraid to look the savages in the face, and to use their hands to supply their bodily wants.\nOthers could see no good in the Indians but to kill them, or to exile them from the country.\nThese things were doubtless exaggerated in the popular mind. But they do indicate the nature of the dilemma that perplexed the colonizers. The only way to avoid eventual conflict with the Indians was to convert them to Christianity, and yet that was slow to happen.\nSOLUTION: William Bradford expresses surprise that Native Americans could learn English and serve as cultural intermediaries.\nWhat a joy it is to see these Indians so willingly embrace English ways!"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Wherever I go\u2014the street, the shop, the house, or the steamboat\u2014I hear the people talk in such a way as to indicate that they are yet unable to conceive of the Negro as possessing any rights at all. Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

They believed that the new government's power should be based on the consent of the governed and that it should be able to address a number of pressing issues, including trade, taxes, and defense.\nA series of essays, written by Publius under the name \"Madison,\" were published in newspapers and later collected in a book called The Federalist. These essays argued for the importance of a strong central government and explained the proposed new constitution as a way to achieve that end.\nFederalist essays 10 and 51 are often assigned in high school courses.\nFederalist 10 discusses the necessity of a strong central government to prevent the kind of factionalism that was evident in the decade-long debate over independence. The author, James Madison, describes the ways in which a faction, or a group with a common interest, can deprive other groups of their rights. Madison argues that a strong central government, with a broad authority, is necessary to prevent such abuses.\nFederalist 51 explains the structure of the new government that would be established by the proposed constitution. Madison argues that the new government would be a single entity with many parts. He argues that the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the government would be so designed as to prevent any one part from being able to dominate the others. This article emphasizes the importance of the proposed government's powers and of the checks and balances that would ensure that the different parts of the government were in balance."}

In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Act, which limited the president's ability to commit U.S. forces to war. The act was a response to the Vietnam War and to the belief that the executive branch had waged war without a formal declaration from Congress.\nThe Tet Offensive of 1968 was one of the turning points of the Vietnam War.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nOne of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative.

When they do, they typically argue that the new program or legislation is necessary or desirable on the basis of certain principles or ideas.\nPrinciples and ideas can be influential because they can help to guide government policy and affect how people think about important issues. Some principles and ideas are broad and all-encompassing, while others are narrow and specific.\nOne important principle that has influenced government policy is the idea of limited government. Limited government is the principle that there are limits to how much government can or should do. This idea has been influential in the United States since its founding.\nAnother important principle that has influenced government policy is the idea of liberty. Liberty is the principle that people should be free to do as they please as long as they do not harm others. This idea has been influential in the United States since its founding.\nA specific idea that has influenced government policy is the idea that the government has a responsibility to take care of its citizens. This idea has been influential in the United States since the New Deal era of the 1930 s.\nSOLUTION: Calvin Coolidge's ideas about taxation were influenced by the principles of limited government and liberty. He believed that the government should not take more than necessary from its citizens and that people should be free to do as they please with their own property.\nIn the 1920 s, the United States economy was prosperous, but there were also widespread concerns about the growth of the welfare state.

Zenger, a New York newspaper editor, had been accused of criticizing the royal governor. His lawyer, Alexander Hamilton's famous grandfather, argued that the truth was not punishable under the law. Zenger was acquitted, and the case became a symbol of the fight for freedom of speech and the press in America.\nThe passage above describes a series of events that are part of a continuity with the events of the Zenger trial. All of the events are instances of colonial Americans taking matters into their own hands to deal with Indian violence. In the passage, the Paxton Boys describe their actions as a response to the failure of the colonial government to protect the frontiers from Indian attacks.

It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.'

In January 1918, he made a speech to the U.S. Senate in which he explained why America was fighting. He said that the United States was neutral in the sense that it was not taking the war to other countries. However, he acknowledged that the United States was involved in the war in a limited way.\n\"We are not neutral in respect to the ultimate outcome of the war. We are adhering to the cause of the United States and the cause of the human rights. It is not a war between two countries, but a war between the forces of the right and the forces of the wrong.

This action was the \"straw that broke the camel's back,\" as far as the United States was concerned.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky.

Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors.

Even before the United States was a country, states debated how much power to give the central government. The debates continued after the country was formed, and they have never completely stopped.\nThomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton had disagreements about federal power and states' rights in the 1790 s. Their debates led to the formation of the first political party in the United States, the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party.\nThe questions below refer to the following excerpt from the textbook.\n\"The Constitution does not explicitly mention voting rights. But the right to vote is implicit in the concept of citizenship. The Bill of Rights describes the rights of American citizens. Since the Constitution does not specify how citizens are to choose their government, it is up to the states to decide.\nThe states have also been able to extend voting rights to noncitizens. For example, in Minnesota, voting rights are given to noncitizens who have been in the United States for at least one year.\nThe ability of states to extend voting rights to noncitizens is one of the issues that debates over federal power and states' rights have never completely stopped.\nSome people think that the federal government should be able to set rules for all states. Others think that states should be able to do whatever the federal government does not prevent them from doing.\nThe debates over federal power and states' rights have been among the major issues in U.S. history. They have led to constitutional amendments, such as the Eleventh Amendment, which says that states cannot be sued by other states. The debates have also been important in recent U.S. history. For example, the debates were major issues in the presidential campaigns of the 1960 s.\"\nSOLUTION: The passage uses a historical context to discuss the continuity of debates over federal power and states' rights. The quotation from Martin Luther King, Jr., discusses the interrelatedness of all communities and states. It shows that debates over states' rights were important during the Civil Rights Movement."}

Some laws required that people attend their local church and forbade them from preaching or holding religious meetings without the permission of the local government.

The Puritan church had become complacent, and many colonists had begun to question their faith.\nIn response to these concerns, the Great Awakening movement began. The movement's leaders were ministers who traveled through the colonies, holding revival meetings and calling for a personal, emotional religion that emphasized repentance, humility, and a direct relationship with God.\nThe Awakening did not create a new religion, but it did lead to the emergence of a new type of minister.

I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals.
