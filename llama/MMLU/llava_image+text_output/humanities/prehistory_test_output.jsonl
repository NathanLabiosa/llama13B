The study of human evolution can help you understand how our ancestors lived and what challenges they faced.\nWhen scientists study human evolution, they consider a number of factors, including the fossil record, ancient DNA, and comparative anatomy.\nThe fossil record contains the remains of organisms that lived in the past. Sometimes, the remains of many individuals of the same species can be found in a small area. These remains suggest that the species lived and died in that area. Other times, the remains of only a few individuals of the same species have been found over a large area. These remains suggest that the species was widespread.\nAncient DNA is DNA that has survived from ancient organisms. Scientists can use ancient DNA to learn more about the past behavior of species.\nComparative anatomy is the study of the body parts of organisms. By comparing the body parts of different species, scientists can determine how those species are related.\nSOLUTION: Homo erectus and Homo sapiens are not sister species. Because Homo erectus and Homo sapiens are not sister species, they do not have the same ancestor.\nAnatomically modern humans are Homo sapiens. When anatomically modern humans first arrived in the Middle East, they encountered Homo erectus.\nThe first Homo sapiens lived in Africa. About 200,000 years ago, some Homo sapiens arrived in the Middle East. Other humans also arrived later.\nNeandertals are a sister species to Homo sapiens.

But the types of tools that each culture used showed different ways of exploiting their environment.\nMousterian tools were made with a hard rock called flint. Flint is tough, so it can be used to make sharp blades. However, flint is also hard to work with. To make a blade out of flint, a craftsman had to remove a lot of rock. As a result, most Mousterian tools have a lot of wasted material.\nAurignacian tools were made with a softer rock called limestone. Limestone is easier to work with than flint, so Aurignacian tools usually wasted less material.

One way that anthropologists study these things is by looking at how they developed.\nAnthropologists observe that many traits of a culture must be present in the world before they can appear in a particular culture. For example, writing must be invented before it can be used to record the stories and laws of a culture. Likewise, the domestication of animals must be discovered before animals can be used for food and transportation.\nAnthropologists also observe that traits of a culture often spread from one culture to another. For example, the idea of using iron weapons was first discovered by people in the ancient Near East, but it soon spread to neighboring cultures. The spread of ideas from one culture to another can be caused by migration, war, trade, or the movement of ideas through books and other writings.\nThe way that anthropologists describe the spread of cultural traits is called cultural diffusion. Cultural diffusion is the process by which ideas, practices, and objects move from one culture to another.\nSOLUTION: The question asks about the belief that all of the characteristics of civilization developed in one place and then spread out. This belief is called diffusionism.\nDiffusionism is the idea that cultural traits spread from one culture to another. This illustration shows how diffusionism might have worked.\nThis illustration is not meant to show exactly what happened. Rather, it is meant to show how anthropologists think that cultural traits might have spread through diffusion.

Ethnographic evidence supports the following conclusions:\nSurpluses are not always produced by agriculturalists. For example, some foraging societies produce surpluses, but food is not the primary focus of their societies.\nEconomic inequalities are not always dependent on agriculture. In some societies where most people are farmers, food surpluses are not the primary cause of economic inequalities.\nThe production of surplus food is important in the development of economic inequalities and social complexity. However, this does not mean that all societies that produce food surpluses will develop economic inequalities and social complexity. Other factors, such as population size and political system, are also important.\nSOLUTION: The question focuses on the connection between surplus food and social complexity. Ethnographic evidence shows that surplus food is important in the development of economic inequalities and social complexity. However, only agriculturalists can produce the food surplus necessary for economic inequality. Some resource-rich environments allow for the creation of surpluses that can lead to economic inequalities and social complexity. The production of surplus food is not important in the development of economic inequalities or social complexity. Economic inequalities are the foundation of social complexity and entirely dependent on agriculture for the production of surplus food."}

Some of these features are absolutely necessary for a society to be considered a civilization. Other features are probably necessary for a civilization to become a world power.\nPopulation size and concentration: A civilization is usually defined by a large population. Ancient civilizations were concentrated in the Nile River Valley, Mesopotamia, and the Yellow River Valley.\nFarming: Farming is necessary to feed a large population. Ancient civilizations developed irrigation and the plow to increase the yield of their farm land.\nCities: Cities are necessary to support a large population. Cities also concentrate resources and ideas, which helps civilizations grow.\nWritten language: A written language is necessary to keep track of information and ideas. Sumerian writing was the first written language.\nGovernment: A civilization needs a way to organize its society. Ancient civilizations developed different types of government.\nLaw: A civilization needs a way to resolve disputes and maintain order.

What archaeological, historical, or ethnographic evidence suggests that a particular practice was borrowed? How many other practices might be affected by borrowing? Are there any other possible explanations for the evidence?\nThe Olmec civilization of Mexico developed a number of new ideas and technologies that were shared with other groups. One of these was the practice of ritual human sacrifice.\nRitual sacrifice was practiced in the earlier Mesoamerican cultures of Mezcala and San Lorenzo. The Aztecs and Maya also practiced ritual sacrifice, and it is likely that they learned it from the Olmec.\nThere is evidence that the Hohokam, a group of farmers who lived in what is now Arizona, borrowed the practice of ritual human sacrifice from Mesoamerican cultures. The Hohokam had no tradition of human sacrifice before they adopted this practice.\nAnother example of cultural borrowing is the playing of ritual ball games. The Maya and Aztecs played a game called pok-ta-pok, which was also played by other cultures in Mesoamerica.\nThe construction of stepped pyramids is another example of a practice that was borrowed. The Maya and Aztecs did not build pyramids until after they had contact with other Mesoamerican cultures.\nMaize beer was a Mesoamerican practice that was not present in the earlier cultures of the Southwest. But maize beer was also a common practice in other parts of North America. So, it is possible that the borrowing was from a more widely distributed practice, not just from Mesoamerican cultures."}

One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can have multiple parts that are tested and measured. Examples of parts of experiments that are often tested and measured in animal studies include the part of the experiment that is different or changed and the part that is measured.\nSOLUTION: Step 1: Look at each answer choice.\nThe anatomy of Australopithecus africanus hands and analogies with studies of living non-human primates that demonstrate tool use does not involve pieces of stone. So, cut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone are not cut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone.\nSimple stone cores, anvil stones, and flakes found at the Lomekwi 3 site in West Turkana, Kenya are not cut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone.\nCut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone are cut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone. This answer choice shows how the anatomy of Australopithecus africanus hands and analogies with studies of living non-human primates that demonstrate tool use support the argument that hominids made and used stone tools by at least 3.3 million years ago.\nAll of the above are cut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone.\nStep 2: Determine which answer choice is the best.\nThe Lomekwi 3 site in West Turkana, Kenya is an archaeological site that contains simple stone cores, anvil stones, and flakes. So, simple stone cores, anvil stones, and flakes found at the Lomekwi 3 site in West Turkana, Kenya are cut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone."}

Haplogroups can be used to track the ancestry of organisms, including people.\nThe cells in the body contain mitochondria and chromosomes. Mitochondria and chromosomes are passed down from parents to offspring.\nMitochondria have their own set of chromosomes. Offspring receive their mitochondria from their parents.\nChromosomes are passed down in sets of two. Offspring receive one set of chromosomes of each type from each parent.\nHaplogroups are created by comparing the sets of chromosomes that cells have. Haplogroups are based on the similarities between the chromosomes.\nSome haplogroups have names. Other haplogroups are identified by numbers. Haplogroups that have names are given a type of symbol. For example, the mitochondrial haplogroup H is often denoted by the symbol H.\nHaplogroups can change when cells have changes in their chromosomes. Over time, different groups of cells will have different haplogroups.\nThis means that organisms with the same haplogroup are descended from a common ancestor. The different haplogroups that an organism has are called the organism's haplogroup spectrum.\nHaplogroups can be used to study human migration. Haplogroups can provide information about where ancestors of modern humans may have come from.\nSOLUTION: The earliest migrants to the New World do not match those of modern Native Americans.

Stone tools are important because they are the first objects made by humans.\nBefore 400,000 years ago, there were several hominid species. The most famous are Australopithecus afarensis and Sahelanthropus tchadensis. These species are part of the human line of evolution, but they are not direct ancestors of modern humans.\nAustralopithecus afarensis is the species to which the famous hominid skeleton \"Lucy\" belongs. Sahelanthropus tchadensis is the earliest known hominid species that was capable of walking upright on two legs.\nSOLUTION: Bipedalism is the ability to walk on two legs. Bipedalism and relatively stable brain size are key traits of hominids. These traits appeared together in hominids 400,000 years ago."}

These societies have differed in ways that have included how they obtained food, how they organized their economies, and how they lived.\nThroughout much of their history, humans have obtained food by foraging. Foraging involves gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals. Foragers usually do not have to plant or tend crops or raise animals.\nAgricultural societies are societies in which people farm for their livelihood. That is, they grow crops and raise animals. Agriculture allows people to produce more food than they can gather or hunt.\nSome of the first agricultural societies arose about 10,000 years ago. Agricultural societies have a harder time than foraging societies did. Agricultural societies have to find ways to organize their work. They also have to find ways to cooperate and communicate.\nArchaic states are societies with an organized government and a sense of common identity. These societies, which appeared about 5,000 years ago, were the first to require their citizens to pay taxes.\nPrimitive civilizations are societies that are organized into cities and have a complex economy. These societies also have a sense of common identity.\nSOLUTION: To build monumental structures, people must have had a relatively advanced level of organization. So, the people who built these structures were not foragers.\nThe people who built these structures were also not affluent foragers. Affluent foragers have a surplus of food and can use it to buy luxuries.\nSo, the people who built these structures were not affluent foragers.\nMonumental structures also require a certain level of cooperation.

Fossils are the remains of organisms that lived long ago. Scientists look at fossils to find out what organisms looked like, what they ate, and how they lived.\nIn the past, fossils were classified into groups based on their anatomical similarities. But recent research has shown that this approach assumes that evolution proceeds at a constant rate. Evolution does not. Organisms that are not closely related can have similar traits because they adapted to similar environments. So, fossils that used to be classified into the same group may not have been as closely related as once thought.\nNow, fossils are classified into groups based on their evolutionary relationships. Scientists look at the fossil record for organisms that have traits in common. Then, they try to determine if these organisms were part of a group that evolved into other organisms.\nSOLUTION: Homo erectus is classified as a hominid.

Isotopes of carbon are chemically identical elements, but the nuclei of their atoms have different numbers of neutrons. Because they are chemically identical, isotopes of carbon behave the same way chemically. But because their nuclei have different numbers of neutrons, isotopes of carbon have different atomic masses.\nThe atomic mass of a nutrient is a measure of its weight. Scientists use units of amu (atoms per molecule). The atomic mass of a nutrient is typically given in units of amu.\nFor example, the atomic mass of carbon-12 is 12 amu. The atomic mass of carbon-14 is 14 amu. The atomic mass of carbon-13 is 13 amu.\nThe different isotopes of carbon make different contributions to the atomic mass of a substance. In a substance that contains carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14, the atomic mass of carbon is the sum of the atomic masses of carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14.\nSOLUTION: Researchers can estimate an individual's diet by analyzing the levels of 13C in their bones. The atomic mass of 13C is 13 amu.\nThe bones of people who ate mostly grains have more 13C than the bones of people who ate mostly meat.\nSo, analyzing the levels of 13C in bones can tell whether an individual ate mostly grains or mostly meat."}

The choice of a particular people group depends on the time period and the location.\nMore than 200 hundred years ago, the northwest coast of North America was home to many different people groups. Some of these people groups were foragers who hunted and gathered berries. Other people groups were agriculturalists who grew crops. For example, the Chinookan people lived along the Columbia River and grew crops. The Salishan people lived along the Pacific Ocean from northwest Washington to northwest California and were foragers.\nMore than 100 years ago, Europeans and Americans began to explore and settle on the northwest coast. Many Native American groups were conquered by these outsiders. For example, the Aztec were a group of Mexican people. They were not on the northwest coast of North America, but they were conquered by the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes in 1521."}

Scientists study the fossils of hominids to learn about the ancestors of modern people.\nBecause there were many hominid species, there was not just one answer to the question of what helped early hominids survive and thrive. Different hominids evolved different traits.\nSome hominids evolved the ability to hunt large mammals. This required cooperation and communication among hunters. Being able to hunt large mammals may have helped early hominids get food.\nSome hominids evolved the ability to survive and reproduce. This allowed them to have offspring and pass their traits to the next generation. Being able to interbreed with other hominids may have helped early hominids survive and thrive.\nSome hominids evolved the ability to adapt to changing environments. This allowed them to survive and thrive in a wide range of habitats. Being able to adapt may have helped early hominids survive.\nSome hominids evolved the ability to control fire.

These rulers not only controlled their own city-states but also exerted influence over other city-states through alliances and military strength.\nThe Aztecs did not have a central government like modern nation-states. Instead, the Aztec Empire was a multi-city state system in which individual city-states had a great deal of autonomy. However, the city-states also cooperated and interacted with each other in complex ways. One of the ways they did this was through tribute payments.\nTribute payments were a crucial part of the Aztec economy. City-states paid tribute to the empire in the form of gold, jade, feathers, cloth, and jewels. In turn, the empire provided security and protection to the city-states.\nThe Aztec Empire also had a highly developed system of social and religious control. The Aztecs believed that the gods had instructed their warriors to build a sacred city on top of a mountain. To do this, the Aztecs needed to conquer other city-states and use tribute payments to fund their military campaigns."}
