It is a set of legal norms that are not part of the domestic law of any state. Instead, these norms arise from international agreements and are accepted by governments as part of a community of nations.\nAn essential aspect of the international legal system is the concept of international legal personality. This concept determines whether an entity has rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.\nThe concept of international legal personality is different from the concept of legal personality in domestic law. In domestic law, legal personality is a characteristic of an individual or an organization. It means that an individual or an organization is a legal entity that can sue and be sued.\nInternational legal personality is similar to legal personality in domestic law. It means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.\nThere are four categories of international legal personality:\nStates are the most important actors in the international legal system. States have the most extensive rights and duties under international law.\nIntergovernmental organizations are entities that governments create. Examples include the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. These organizations have rights and duties under international law.\nOrganizations that are not intergovernmental organizations may also have rights and duties under international law. These rights and duties may arise from international agreements between governments or from customary international law.\nIndividuals may have rights and duties under international law. In some cases, individuals may bring cases to international courts.\nSOLUTION: International legal personality means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.\nThis definition is similar to the definition of legal personality in domestic law. In both cases, the concept describes an entity that has rights and duties under the law."}

IOs have immunity in two different forms: procedural immunity and substantive immunity.\nProcedural immunity involves immunity from suit. This means that an IO cannot be sued in the courts of another state without that state's consent.\nSubstantive immunity involves immunity from liability. This means that an IO is not liable to pay damages in the courts of another state, even if a court in that state finds that the IO should be held liable.\nThe principal source of immunity for IOs is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunities. This convention, which is a treaty, provides the main rules for the immunity of IOs.\nThe UN Charter is the treaty that created the United Nations. The UN Charter provides some rules for the immunity of IOs, but it is not the principal source of immunity.\nHeadquarters agreements and multilateral treaties providing specific immunities are agreements between an IO and a host state. These agreements do not create immunity. Instead, they make clear the immunity that is already there.\nCustomary law is the law that states follow out of a sense of legal obligation. According to some legal experts, customary law can provide the basis for immunity for IOs. But the principal source of immunity for IOs is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunities."}

When states gather together in international assemblies, they often seek to agree on standards that will guide their conduct. These standards can take the form of treaties, conventions, and other agreements.\nStandards can serve as guidelines for how states should act. For example, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a set of international standards that sets out a number of rights that all humans should enjoy.\nSOLUTION: The function of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy is to put forward binding legal standards. Binding standards are rules that states are expected to follow. These standards are voted on and agreed upon by governments.\nGovernments are expected to abide by the standards. If a government breaks a standard, other states can use diplomacy to press the government to comply."}

States and international organisations are international legal persons.\nInternational legal personality is limited. It is not absolute. Limited international legal personality means that you have some rights and can be a party to certain international legal proceedings.

International law applies between states, while domestic law applies within states.\nDualism suggests that international and domestic laws comprise distinct legal Systems.\nUnder dualism, the laws applied in international disputes are international law, and the laws applied in domestic disputes are domestic law.\nIn recent years, some scholars have criticized the theory of dualism, suggesting that international law and domestic law are not distinct legal systems. These scholars argue that domestic courts can and should apply international law in certain cases."}

The incorporation of customary crimes into the domestic sphere means that a state's domestic laws come to regulate these crimes.\nThe inclusion of customary crimes within the domestic sphere is not a clear-cut matter. If customary crimes are not recognized in the domestic sphere, they are not enforceable in the jurisdiction. However, customary crimes can be incorporated into the domestic sphere.\nThere are three ways in which customary crimes can be incorporated into the domestic sphere:\n1. Act of Parliament: An act of parliament can incorporate customary crimes into the domestic sphere. However, this is not a straightforward process. A significant amount of evidence must be presented to the British Parliament to demonstrate that a customary crime has been committed.\n2. Common law: The common law can also incorporate customary crimes into the domestic sphere. However, the common law can only incorporate crimes that are recognized by the international community. In other words, the crimes must be customary laws that are so widely accepted that they are considered part of the international legal system.\n3. Multilateral treaty: Customary crimes must be contained in a multilateral treaty in order to be automatically incorporated into the domestic sphere. A multilateral treaty is a treaty that is signed by multiple states.\nThe correct answer is C."}

This section explains when the Court requires such protection.\nThe most basic of these obligations is the obligation to refrain from acts that may cause disadvantage, injury or death. For example, the state must refrain from using excessive force or from failing to intervene to protect an individual from the violent acts of others.\nThe state also has an obligation to investigate acts that may have caused disadvantage, injury or death. For example, if a member of the armed forces shoots and kills an individual, the state must investigate the act to determine whether it was necessary and proportionate.\nThe state also has an obligation to provide a remedy when an individual has been disadvantaged, injured or killed by the act of another person. For example, if an individual is injured in a traffic accident, the state must provide a remedy, such as compensation, to address the harm caused by the accident.\nIn addition to these obligations, the state has a positive obligation to protect individuals from the actions of private actors. For example, the state must protect women from domestic violence.\nThe state also has an obligation to develop a legal framework to protect those within its jurisdiction. For example, the state must provide remedies for violations of environmental laws.\nThe state must also take measures to ensure that all individuals have access to housing.\nSOLUTION: When the applicant is in the custody of the state is a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect. The European Court of Human Rights has developed this situation over time. For example, in the case of Anufrijeva v. Russia, the Court held that the state must protect an individual from the harm caused by the actions of other individuals who are also in state custody.\nTo provide housing for all those homeless within a state is not a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect. The European Court of Human Rights has not developed this situation as requiring positive obligations.\nDevelop a legal framework to protect those within the state is a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect. The European Court of Human Rights has developed this situation over time. For example, in the case of Airey v. Ireland, the Court held that the state must provide a remedy for violations of environmental laws.\nWhere the state must investigate claims against it is a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect. The European Court of Human Rights has developed this situation over time. For example, in the case of Makhmudov and Khudayarov v. Russia, the Court held that the state must investigate claims that police officers had tortured two individuals."}

So, the first court or tribunal to hear a dispute does not have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThe International Court of Justice has by definition priority over any other court or tribunal.

They include the right to life, the prohibition of slavery, the right to a fair trial, and the right to freedom of expression.\nSocial and economic rights are rights that concern the distribution of wealth, and the right to a decent standard of living.

As with any legal system, there are problems and challenges that can arise in international law.\nOne issue that can arise is fragmentation. Fragmentation of international law concerns the possibility of different legal regimes develop in isolation from each other. As a result, different rules of international law can be produced, and these rules can come into conflict with one another.\nFor example, consider two legal regimes: trade law and environmental law. Imagine that rules in one legal regime incentivize countries to trade with each other, while rules in the other legal regime incentivize countries to protect the environment. If these rules come into conflict, countries may have to choose between protecting the environment and trading with other countries.\nFragmentation is also when States assume different interpretations of the same rule of international law. For example, different countries may have different ideas about what constitutes an act of aggression. If countries make different interpretations of the same rule, this can lead to different countries taking different actions.\nSOLUTION: The problem of fragmentation is when different legal regimes develop in isolation from each other. This can lead to the production of divergent rules of international law.\nFor example, consider the relationship between foreign investment law and human rights law. These two legal regimes can develop in isolation from each other. As a result, different rules can be produced, and these rules can come into conflict with each other.\nFor example, an investment treaty may require a country to pay compensation to an investor if the country violates the treaty. This could include violations of human rights. But human rights law may require a country to protect the rights of individuals to bring complaints against other countries. This could include the right to bring complaints against foreign investors."}

In each case, the official is acting within the scope of his or her official duties.\nAs a prosecutor, Harris knows that the police have arrested the wrong person for a drug crime. Harris wants to go to the police and tell them to release the wrong person. If Harris does this, Harris will be sued for damages. As a prosecutor, Harris has immunity.\nAs a prosecutor, Harris wants to stop a news rack campaign that is critical of her. Harris wants to use a civil suit to stop the campaign. If Harris does this, Harris will be sued for damages. As a prosecutor, Harris has immunity.\nIn each of the following cases, the official is not immune from liability. In each case, the official is acting outside the scope of his or her official duties.\nA prosecutor wants to use a civil suit to get back at a rival political candidate. The prosecutor sues the candidate for damages. The prosecutor is not immune from liability.\nA prosecutor wants to enforce a state statute that is unconstitutional. The prosecutor sues the defendant for damages. The prosecutor is not immune from liability.\nSOLUTION: Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act.\nIf the person is not acting within the scope of his or her official duties, then the person is not immune.\nIf the person is acting within the scope of his or her official duties, then the person is immune.\nThe scope of official duties is determined by the legislature. In Texas, the scope of official duties is determined by the Texas Legislature.\nThe Texas Legislature has not said that any particular official is immune from liability. So, the following officials are not immune from liability:\nthe governor and other state officials;\na district attorney or criminal district attorney;\na county attorney or city attorney; or\na justice, judge, or magistrate."}

A public act is not a mere routine matter. It is typically an act that requires the official to exercise his or her discretion, such as making a decision or issuing a ruling.\nA private act is an act that is done by a government official in his or her non-official capacity. A private act is a mere matter that does not require the official to exercise his or her discretion.\nThe immunity of a government official is called official immunity. An official has official immunity for acts done in his or her official capacity. An official has absolute official immunity for acts done in his or her official capacity. An official has qualified official immunity for acts done in his or her official capacity. The official immunity of a government official is different from the immunity of the government itself. The government has sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity means that the government cannot be sued.\nA former head of State is a foreign state official. A foreign state official has immunity. A foreign state official has absolute immunity. A foreign state official has qualified immunity.\nSOLUTION: The Pinochet case confirmed that the head of a foreign state enjoys immunity for official acts. It also confirmed that the head of a foreign state does not enjoy immunity for non-official acts.\nIn the Pinochet case, the House of Lords confirmed that the former head of a foreign state enjoys immunity for official acts. The House of Lords also confirmed that the former head of a foreign state ceases to enjoy personal immunity once removed from office."}

Monists posits that international law and domestic law are part of the same legal order.\nMonistic theorists argue that international law is not necessarily inferior to domestic law. They claim that domestic and international law do not exist in isolation from each other. Rather, the two types of law are part of a single legal system.\nAccording to this theory, when domestic law and international law conflict, domestic law must yield to international law. This is because international law is superior in terms of its legal order. However, if international law and domestic law are in harmony, then domestic law is the superior law.\nSOLUTION: The fundamental premise of monist theory is that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order. According to this theory, when domestic law and international law conflict, domestic law must yield to international law. This is because international law is part of a superior legal order."}

An organisation's charter is its contract, so to speak, with the international community. It is the source of its powers, or authority, to act. If a power is not explicitly granted in the charter, it may still be implicitly granted by an expansive interpretation of the charter. An expansive interpretation is one that gives more power to the organisation than a strict interpretation would. So, implied powers are those whose determination depends on an expansive interpretation of an organisation's charter."}
