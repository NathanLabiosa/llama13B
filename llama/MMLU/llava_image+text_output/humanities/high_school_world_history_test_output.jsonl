{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.

On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land.

But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.

Harappan civilization, which developed around the same time as ancient Sumer, was located along the Indus River in what is now Pakistan. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Harappan civilization had a well-developed trade network.\nThe presence of highly developed port cities was another key driving force in the development of the ancient economy. Ancient Sumer was located between two major trading networks. The trade networks on either side of Sumer both reached the Persian Gulf, but the network to the west reached an area with few ports.\nSOLUTION: Competition with European trade networks led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal.\nIn the journal, Ibn Battuta describes a thriving port city, 'Aden, which was a crucial stop on the trade route between India and Arabia. The port city's success was based on its role as a center for the trade of goods such as spices and textiles.\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the sea route around the horn of Africa was the main route for Europeans to reach the riches of Asia. European rulers wanted their merchants to have access to this profitable trade. So, they funded the development of ships and the search for new trade routes.\nBy the 17th century, European nations had established extensive trade networks. European traders could transport goods great distances over water. The presence of highly developed port cities, such as 'Aden, allowed these traders to resupply and do business."}

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Killing of civilians during wartime"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Violence is a serious matter, and there are many forms of violence. It is not always easy to decide how to classify a particular act of violence. Here are some types of violence that might help you decide.\nPolitical violence involves the use of force for political purposes. This can include violence against individuals or property, as well as counterviolence.\nSocio-economic violence involves the use of violence to keep people or groups apart. This can include violence based on race, religion, or income.\nStructural violence involves the use of institutions to harm people or groups. This can include violence against groups that is built into the structure of a society.\nDirect violence involves the direct use of force against an individual or group. This can include violence against persons or property.\nIndirect violence involves harm to individuals or groups that is not immediately obvious. This can include violence in the form of a harmful substance or a harmful practice.\nCross-sectional violence involves violence between people or groups who are not part of the same group. This can include violence between classes, nations, or ethnic groups.\nThe section \"Types of Violence\" of the Annual Review of Sociology is a useful resource for considering the different types of violence.\nSOLUTION: The first passage suggests that the violence was aimed at people of a particular race or ethnicity, and that it was part of a larger war of independence. These details suggest that the violence was an act of state-sponsored campaigns of genocide. The second passage suggests that the violence was an act of state-sponsored campaigns of genocide. The phrase \"monopoly of violence\" is used to describe the idea that governments have a right to use violence to maintain order. This violence is used to maintain a social order that is already unjust. So, the violent act is an abuse of power."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The development of Special Economic Zones along the coast brought economic growth to China, and the rural economy steadily declined.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs."}, {"label": "D", "text": "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: During the 1500 s, European countries were able to gain a significant edge in military power over the Chinese. One important reason for this edge was that European countries invested more in new military technologies, such as artillery, firearms, and naval ships.\nThe passage explains that Chinese military leaders did not prioritize investment in the new technologies of gunpowder weaponry. Instead, they devoted their resources to the improvement of traditional horse archer units.\nThis decision was likely due to the fact that the Chinese were not under the same pressure as Europe was to change its military technology. The Chinese had already invented gunpowder, which was a more powerful explosive than any other explosive in use at that time. The Chinese also had a strong, centralized government that could afford to invest in new military technologies.\nHowever, the Chinese were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so. Confucianism is a traditional Chinese philosophy that emphasizes the importance of tradition and virtue. Confucian traditionalism discouraged the Chinese from innovation and emphasized the importance of maintaining the status quo."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope\u2026\n\u2026The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures?

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute.

At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nBoth passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Emerging systems of coerced labor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The expansion of chattel slavery"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Initially, the labor of indigenous peoples was exploited through forced labor.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony].

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nWhether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe authors of both passages served institutions associated with which of the following colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Direct rule by the crown"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Complete privatization of colonial authority"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Martial law enforced by sizable armies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Both William Bentinck and George Simpson spoke in the service of companies. Company officers were not typically crown employees, but they did have a great deal of power.\nIn the early nineteenth century, many Western imperial powers followed a strategy of using companies to govern colonies. Under this colonial technique, companies were chartered to assume the costs of establishing a colony and to share the profits that the colony generated.\nUnlike crown employees, company officers had to answer to the company's shareholders. Shareholders could force company officers to resign if they were not satisfied with their performance. So, company officers had a strong financial incentive to make the colony profitable."}

In Europe, many states became more powerful, and new trading companies were established. Many societies in Africa, the Americas, and Asia suffered significant population declines, partly because of the spread of diseases. New trade routes were established, and some old routes were abandoned.\nOne major change during this period was the eastward expansion of European trading companies. This expansion was driven in part by the search for new trade partners and resources. It also led to the establishment of new trading routes and the decline of existing routes.\nFor example, the Portuguese conquest of India enabled the Portuguese to establish a land route to China. This new route allowed the Portuguese to bypass the Middle East and to trade with China directly. As a result of this change, the Portuguese could sell Chinese goods in Europe without having to purchase them from Middle Eastern merchants.\nThe Spanish conquest of Mexico created a new trade partner for Europe. The Spanish brought silver from Mexico to Europe in exchange for goods such as textiles. This new trade helped to fuel the European economy.\nThe eastward expansion of Russia enabled Russia to become a major trading partner with Europe. Russia provided Europe with access to Asian markets, and Europe provided Russia with much-needed technology and goods.\nThe establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate led to the isolation of Japan. Before the isolation, the Japanese were involved in international trade. But after the isolation, Japan had no trade partners.\nSOLUTION: Look for the development that directly led to a change in where goods were traded.\nThe establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate led to the isolation of Japan. So, when Japan was isolated, it was no longer directly involved in the trade of goods.\nThe Portuguese conquest of India, the eastward expansion of Russia, and the Spanish conquest of Mexico helped create new trade partners for Europe. So, when Europe had these new trade partners, it traded goods with them instead of with Japan."}

But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.

For example, in the Theravada tradition, Buddhism has moved from being a religion for the ruling elite to being a religion for the common people. In the Tibetan tradition, Buddhism has become a religion of the clergy, with a complex hierarchy of priests and lamas.\nOne reason for these changes has been the incorporation of local customs and beliefs into Buddhist practices. Another reason has been the exposure of Buddhism to other religions, such as Christianity and Islam.\nBuddhism has also modernized in response to the social and political changes that have occurred throughout the world in the past 500 years. For example, some Buddhists have advocated social reform, while others have focused on personal spiritual development.\nSOLUTION: The excerpt describes the Buddhist concept of reincarnation.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity.

Stalin argues that the Soviet Union must accelerate its industrial development in order to compete with capitalist countries.\nFascism, appeasement, and secret treaties are also influential in Stalin's speech.\nFascism is the idea that the government should be in charge of all aspects of society. Stalin argues that the Soviet Union must accelerate its industrial development in order to compete with fascist countries.\nAppeasement is the policy of giving in to the demands of aggressive countries in order to avoid war.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nThe political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Niccolo Machiavelli's text argues that it is better to be feared than loved.

They will not stand by you in times of need unless they fear your power to harm them.\nMachiavelli's ideas about the importance of being feared were influenced by his observations of the power struggles and violence of the Italian states in the 15th and 16th centuries. He believed that it was necessary for a ruler to be willing to do whatever it took to maintain his power.\nSome other political philosophies of the medieval period, such as those of Thomas Aquinas or Dante Alighieri, did not stress the importance of being feared.

Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny\u2026We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\nThe passage is best understood in the context of the fight for independence in South America."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Purusa-Sukta\"\nPurusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be?

The caste system is a system of social order that divides people into groups based on hereditary social roles. The four main castes are the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas, and the Shudras.\nThe caste you are born into determines your social role and your access to resources. For example, the Brahmins, the caste of priests and scholars, have historically been at the top of the caste system. They have had the opportunity to learn to read and write Sanskrit, the language of the ancient Indo-Aryans. Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism.\nThe Kshatriyas, the caste of warriors and rulers, are below the Brahmins in the caste system. They are allowed to defend the Brahmins and to rule the society.\nThe Vaishyas, the caste of merchants and farmers, are below the Kshatriyas in the caste system. They are allowed to trade with and provide food for the higher castes.\nThe Shudras, the caste of laborers and service providers, are at the bottom of the caste system. They are allowed to provide services to members of the higher castes.\nThe caste system is considered to be one of the oldest forms of social stratification in the world. It is unique in that it is based on hereditary social roles rather than on wealth or social class.\nSOLUTION: The Mahabarata was composed by the person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabarata. The Mahabarata is a Sanskrit epic poem that is one of the oldest and most important texts in the Hindu religion.\nThe text indicates that the gods created the four divisions of human society. In the Purusa-Sukta hymn, the gods are said to have made the worlds by dividing Purusa, the personification of the universe.\nFor there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle suggests that the Kshatriyas are supposed to be warriors. This passage shows that the caste system in ancient India did not imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society. A Kshatriya is supposed to be a warrior, but that does not mean that a Kshatriya cannot be a musician or a cook."}

Colonialism involved one society taking control over another.\nThe exchange of products included the importation of New World products, such as potatoes, corn, and tobacco, into Africa. At the same time, African societies exported slaves, gold, and ivory to European colonizers.\nThe spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa also was an exchange of ideas. But the spread of Christianity was not a trade.

Over time, however, cities began to organize their streets in grids, with wide, straight paths connecting public buildings and homes. This design makes the city easier to navigate and helps make it more organized and easier to defend.\nA city's architecture also evolved over time. In ancient cities, most buildings were made of local materials, such as mudbricks and stone. Temples, however, were often constructed of finer materials, such as white marble, because they were considered sacred.\nSome ancient cities were fortified with walls and gates, while others were not. The choice of whether to build walls was a decision made by the city's leaders.

The Soviet Union saw itself as a major world power and did not want to be beaten by any other country. This desire led the Soviet Union to send troops into Afghanistan in 1979 to support the new communist government there.\nThe speech also helps to explain the creation of the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet Union wanted to make sure that no other country in Eastern Europe challenged its military or political authority. By forming the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union gained a military alliance with several Eastern European countries.\nThe imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe was a decision made in the 1960 s and 1970 s. The Brezhnev Doctrine stated that the Soviet Union had the right to intervene in other socialist countries to protect the interests of the communist party.

Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nHow was the Arab trade in Africans different from the Atlantic slave trade?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: This passage describes the Arab slave trade.\nThe prices listed in the passage are for slaves. Slavery was the practice of taking people against their will and holding them as property. Slaves had no personal freedom. They could be forced to work for their owner.\nThe Arab slave trade differed from the Atlantic slave trade in several ways.\nSome of the slaves taken by Arab merchants were male, and some were female. Both men and women were taken for the Atlantic slave trade.\nSome female slaves were highly valued by Arab merchants. This was because they could be used for sexual activities. But female slaves could also be highly valued by Atlantic slave traders.\nMost slaves taken by Arab merchants were not likely to have a shorter life span. But it is possible that some slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were likely to have a shorter life span.\nReligion may have motivated some people involved in the Atlantic slave trade. But it is unlikely to have been a motivation for Arab slave merchants.\nSlaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female. But slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nThe legacies or adaptations of legacies from the Mongol empire are varied.

Thanks to the Mongols, the Silk Road was reopened, and merchants and travelers could cross the realm without fear.\nReligious tolerance. The Mongols were tolerant of other religions, and they gave religious minoritiespermission to practice their own religions.\nThe game of chess. The game of chess was first developed by Persians, but the Mongols are responsible for making it popular throughout their empire.\nPublic libraries.

A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.

To their narrative, which they gave in the regular order of events, and delivered in perspicuous language, he listened with attentive silence. The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him, and, upon hearing the former read, he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity, the zeal, and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre, he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care.

To obtain precious metals, gems, and other goods, Portugal became involved in the transatlantic slave trade. Many Europeans believed that they had a right to sell slaves to raise money for their wars.\nThe kingdom of Kongo was a frequent target of these slave raids.

For example, the Inca empire was built on the ruins of the Chimor kingdom, which had been built on the ruins of the Tiahuanaco culture.\nWhen a civilization is built on the ruins of another, the people who build it usually try to distinguish themselves from the people they replace. They do this by setting themselves apart in some way.\nFor example, the Inca empire was built on the ruins of the Chimor kingdom, which had been built on the ruins of the Tiahuanaco culture. The Inca empire distinguished itself from these earlier cultures in the following ways:\n\u2022 The Inca empire was larger.\n\u2022 The Inca empire was made up of many small states, but they all used the same language and followed the same laws.\n\u2022 The Inca empire was more efficient. The Inca empire had a better system for collecting taxes and for organizing labor.\nThese ways in which the Inca empire distinguished itself from the earlier cultures are examples of ways in which a conquered people can be treated by their conquerors.\nMany civilizations in the period 600\u20131450 C.E were built on the ruins of others.

Tacitus does not discuss the invitation of barbarians to rule instead of the ruling classes of their host societies.\nBarbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.\nThis choice is incorrect.\nMany ruling classes in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. were religious leaders. So, converting barbarians to the religions of their host societies helped to integrate barbarians into their societies.\nBarbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\nThis choice is incorrect.\nSome civilizations in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. had a servile status for some people. For example, the Aztecs had a servile status for people they conquered. But not all civilizations had a servile status.\nAnd the laws of a society can make conditions better or worse for a group of people. So, the laws of a society can relegate a group of people to a servile status. But the laws can also improve the status of a group of people.\nBarbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\nThis choice is incorrect.\nSoldiers fight for their country. But barbarians did not fight for their host society. They fought for their own society. So, barbarians were not utilized as soldiers in their host societies."}

This shows that Gandhi believed that the country should be self-sufficient in the production of textiles."}

How have people's ideas about work and labor changed throughout history?\nDuring the Agricultural Revolution, people began to live in settled communities rather than moving around in search of food. This change allowed people to grow crops and raise animals to supplement their diets. In addition to farming, people also had to do some hunting and gathering to find food.\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain in the late 1700 s, led to change in how people worked. For the first time, people left their farm homes to work in factories. Factories were able to produce goods faster and at a larger scale than could be done in people's homes. In the factories, people could work with machines to produce goods that could be sold in distant places.\nThe work week was long in the factories. Workers worked between 10 and 16 hours a day, every day of the week. Some workers were allowed to take Sundays off.\nThe practice of having children work in the factories was widely accepted. Children as young as 5 or 6 might work 12-hour days.\nIn the 1800 s, some people began to think about how workers could have a better life. Social reformers helped to change people's beliefs about work. They believed that work should be a positive part of people's lives. They said that workers should be treated with dignity and that they should have enjoyable work.\nThe practices of child labor and long work hours continued for many years. But in the 1800 s and early 1900 s, many people worked to change these practices.\nSOLUTION: The passage is about the working conditions in factories during the Industrial Revolution. In the 1800 s, children were allowed to work in factories. They were often paid low wages, or no wages at all. The children's families were often very poor.\nThe practice of allowing children to work in factories was not questioned until the 1800 s. In the 1830 s, a person named Robert Owen began to speak out about the need to end child labor. Owen believed that children should be able to go to school instead of working.\nIn the 1840 s, the publication of a book called The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 brought attention to the poor working conditions in factories. The author of the book, Frederick Engels, described how factory workers were treated. Engels wrote about the long work days, the low wages, and the unsafe working conditions.\nThe book helped to change people's beliefs about work. Many people began to think that working conditions in factories should be better."}

She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nStalin's efforts to advance Russia as justified by his mention of the \"continual beatings\" were vindicated by which of the following historical events?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Space Race with the United States"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The German invasion of Russia in 1941"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": ""}

On the one hand, they have led to the overthrow of unjust governments, the establishment of new rights, and the improvement of living conditions for many people. On the other hand, revolutions have also resulted in suppression of civil liberties, arbitrary rule, and economic decline. The outcome of a revolution depends on a variety of factors, including the goals of the revolutionaries, the characteristics of the population, and the impact of foreign powers.\nThe French Revolution, for example, led to the rise of the ideology of revolution and the spread of revolution to other parts of Europe. It also resulted in the Reign of Terror, a period of brutality and repression. Similarly, the Russian Revolution achieved the goals of the revolutionaries but led to a totalitarian regime that suppressed dissent and disregarded civil liberties.\nMany historians believe that revolutions are most likely to occur in countries with deep-seated social problems and relatively high nationalism. Countries with a strong tradition of democracy are less likely to experience revolutions.\nSOLUTION: The second passage highlights the disappointment of a woman from Algeria who hoped that the revolution would bring education and economic improvement to her children. The passage also suggests that the independence gained by Algeria did not benefit poor peasants like the speaker's family.\nThe first passage argues that de Gouges believed that the French Revolution failed to gain equal rights for women. The passage suggests that de Gouges believed that men and women are equal, but the leaders of the French Revolution did not.\nBoth passages suggest that the new liberties gained by revolution are not always distributed equally. The upper classes often gain more liberties than the lower classes. In addition, the revolutionaries may not recognize the rights of women or ethnic minorities.\nSo, the correct answer is B."}

The exchange began with Christopher Columbus's first voyage in 1492 and continued as more explorers reached the Americas. The New World offered crops such as maize, potatoes, and tomatoes that became staples in the Old World. The Old World offered livestock such as horses and cattle that became staples in the New World.\nThe exchange of plants and animals between the Old World and the New World took place through different paths. The triangular trade was one of them. The triangular trade was a trade network that shipped goods between the New World, the Old World, and the African Slave Trade.

To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe tone of the first passage best supports which of the following suppositions about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality."}, {"label": "D", "text": "They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": ""}
