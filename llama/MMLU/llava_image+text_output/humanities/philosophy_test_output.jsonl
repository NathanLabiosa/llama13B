He wrote many books on philosophy, but his main ideas are contained in his work Critique of Practical Reason.\nKant believed that the most important thing in life is to have a good will. A good will is a will that always chooses to do what is right. For Kant, the right thing to do is to act according to universal rules, rules that can be applied to everyone.\nFor example, if you decide to tell the truth every time you speak, you are acting according to a universal rule. If everyone always told the truth, the world would be a fairer place.\nKant believed that happiness and right action are not the same thing. You can do right actions and still not be happy. You can be happy and still not be doing right actions."}

They aim to show that the claim or argument is false, or at least that it is not strong enough to support a decision. To do this, skeptical arguments either point out inconsistencies in the claim or argument or raise suspicions about the evidence for it.\nNagel claims that most skeptical arguments are not necessarily the result of applying arbitrarily stringent standards. Instead, skeptical arguments grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards.\nSome arguments are rejected by skeptical standards but not by ordinary standards. For example, perceptual arguments in the philosophy of mind are often rejected by skeptical standards but not by ordinary standards. SOLUTION: Applying ordinary standards, Nagel decides that most skeptical arguments are not logically self-refuting. They are not claims that are necessarily false. Instead, these arguments grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards."}

In political philosophy, theories try to explain the principles that should guide a society.\nImagine that you are a political philosopher who believes that political principles are not invented by governments, but are instead discovered by looking at how well societies meet their members' needs. If that is what you believe, then you might think that the point of a political theory is to find out what those principles are.\nA contract is an agreement between two or more people. In politics, we might think of an original contract as an agreement about how a society should be organized.\nA theory of the original contract would try to explain how that agreement would look.\nWhat would people hope to achieve by entering into the original contract?\nTo answer this question, you need to decide what people seek when they enter into political arrangements. Some people believe that these arrangements should promote the common good. Others believe that the central goal is to prevent harm.\nWhat did people consider just or unjust in the original conditions of their society?\nTo answer this question, you need to decide what people consider just or unjust in the arrangements they make with each other. Some people believe that arrangements that benefit the most people are just. Others believe that arrangements that protect the most fundamental rights are just.\nWhat principles would people accept when they enter into the original contract?\nTo answer this question, you need to decide what principles people would accept when they agree to the original contract. Some principles would guide the benefits and burdens in the society. Other principles would protect the most fundamental rights and freedoms.\nWhat if the original contract is broken?\nEven if the original contract is broken, people in a society may still be bound by some of the principles that underlie that contract. For example, even if the contract is broken, people may still be bound by the principle of not harming others.\nSOLUTION: To decide what Rawls conceives of the original contract as one to do, you need to decide what people seek when they enter into political arrangements, what people consider just or unjust in the original conditions of their society, and what principles people would accept when they enter into the original contract.\nChoice \"A\" is not the answer. Rawls does not think that the original contract is one to enter a particular society. People already belong to a society when they make the original contract.\nChoice \"B\" is not the answer. Rawls does not think that the original contract is one to set up a particular form of government. The original contract is not a contract to establish a particular government. It is a contract to establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society.\nChoice \"C\" is the answer. Rawls conceives of the original contract as one to establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society. He believes that people would accept the principles of justice when they enter into the original contract.\nChoice \"D\" is not the answer. The principles of justice are not the content of morality. They are the principles that people accept when they enter into the original contract."}

Singer argues that these categories are not as clear-cut as usually supposed.\nRights are often classed as negative or positive. Negative rights are said to tell you what the government can't do to you. Positive rights are said to tell you what the government must do for you. But Singer argues that the line between these two types of rights is often blurry. For example, the right to free speech includes the right not to be cursed at. The right to free speech also includes the right to walk down the street without being attacked by a zealot. These latter two rights are positive, not negative.\nDuty and charity are often contrasted as moral concepts that concern what you owe to others. Duty is often seen as negative, as it tells you what you must not do. Charity is seen as positive, as it tells you what you must do. But Singer argues that there is an intermediate set of moral concepts that are neither purely negative nor purely positive. These concepts concern what you owe to others, but they do not divide clearly into negative and positive.\nAltruism and egoism are also contrasted as moral concepts that concern what you owe to others. Altruism is often seen as focusing on the interests of others, while egoism is often seen as focusing on the interests of the self. But Singer argues that these moral concepts also do not divide clearly into negative and positive."}

The higher the point on the line, the more a belief corresponds to reality.\nThe lowest point on the line represents beliefs that correspond to sense experience. These beliefs are unstable and change as our experiences change.\nThe next higher point on the line represents beliefs that are based on the Forms. These beliefs are more stable and permanent than beliefs based on sense experience.\nBeyond the Forms to images of goodness, beauty, and truth obtained from particular objects.\nThis answer choice indicates that, for Plato, knowledge is a belief that is justified by appealing to the Forms. However, the Forms themselves are not things that we observe with our senses. They are unchanging ideas that are perceived as rationally ordered.\nTo what our senses reveal to us about how things appear to us, not how they really are.\nThis answer choice indicates that, for Plato, knowledge is a belief that is justified by appealing to sense experience.

It is not just a matter of what we know.

In other words, we must determine what is right independently of God\u2019s will. But this means that God\u2019s will is not the source of what is right.

Two ways philosophers have tried to do this are by using utilitarianism or Kantianism.\nUtilitarianism is an ethical theory that focuses on the outcome of actions. According to utilitarianism, an action is right if it brings about the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. An action is wrong if it does not.\nDeontological ethics is an ethical theory that focuses on the nature of the action itself. According to deontological ethics, an action is right if it is done for the right reason, even if the outcome is not the best possible. An action is wrong if it is done for the wrong reason, even if the outcome is the best possible.\nImagine that a person does a good deed for a stranger. Using utilitarianism, the rightness of this action does not depend on the person's intent. Instead, it depends on whether the good deed helps the greatest number of people. Using deontological ethics, the rightness of this action depends on the person's intent. If the person intended to help the stranger, the action is right.

In this case, the claim identifies two key terms: \"examining life\" and \"worth living.\"\nWhen examining life, Socrates is often understood to be advocating for thinking deeply and thoroughly about life and the problems that life presents.\nWorth living is also important to Socrates, but the claim does not define these terms. It is often claimed that living a just and virtuous life is worth living. However, it is also common for people to argue that a life of leisure, filled with pleasure and wealth, is worth living.\nSOLUTION: Look for the answer choice that defines worth living in a way that is consistent with Socrates typically being understood to advocate focusing on life and its problems.\nChoice A is consistent with Socrates' claim. Choice B is not. Choice D is not.\nChoice A is incorrect. Socrates does not claim that simply going with the flow is always best. He is advocating for examining life.\nChoice B is incorrect.

For example, it is a matter of mores at a dinner party that you should not talk about politics. Other mores are nearly universal. For example, it is a matter of mores in most cultures that you should not murder people.\nSOLUTION: Baier believes that for a rule to be part of a group's morality, the rule must be universally teachable. This means that people outside the group can understand and be expected to follow the rule.\nMost moralists would agree that a rule is part of a group's morality if the rule is not merely a taboo. Some things that are not mere taboos are also universally teachable. For example, it is a taboo to eat human flesh, but everyone can understand and be expected to follow the rule.\nA rule is part of a group's morality if the rule is universally teachable.

So, in this condition, every man has a right to everything he needs to survive. This includes food, water, and shelter.\nBut Hobbes also believes that in a state of nature, there is a state of war. There is no ruler to decide issues between people. So, every man has a right to defend himself. He can use violence to keep himself safe."}

The fact that an action has bad consequences does not necessarily mean that the action is wrong. But if the bad consequences are unjustifiable, the action is wrong.\nPrinciple of universalizability: An action is wrong if it cannot be universalized. If an action is morally right, then it must be right for everyone to do.

A wrong motive is a motive that is bad.\nSome motives are not as good as other motives. Which motives are the best? Jonas does not say. He only says that a right motive is a good motive.\nThe consequences, or results, of an action can also make the action wrong. For example, consider an action that is done for a good motive.

In other words, the agent treats all people as ends in themselves, not as means to their own ends.\nIf a action is performed out of duty, then the agent acts with moral virtue.\nSome actions are virtuous because they are done out of a sense of duty.

Evidence can come from the text, from external sources, or from the author's own claims.\nThe assessment: The assessment is the evaluation of the claim. It is the decision you make about whether the evidence does a good job of supporting the claim.\nWhen you are evaluating a claim, you should consider the following:\nIs the claim clear? A claim may be difficult to evaluate if it is not clear.\nIs the evidence relevant? The evidence may be relevant or it may be irrelevant.\nIs the evidence substantial? The evidence may be substantial or it may be weak.\nAre there any fallacies?

If an action is commonly observed to have bad consequences, then it is likely to be immoral.\nThere are different ways to describe an action as observed. One way is to describe the effects of the action on things that matter for values. For example, if an action tends to preserve human life, then it is likely to have good consequences.\nAnother way is to describe the effects of the action on people who matter for values.

If the conventional use of a term is unclear, then the reference of the term is uncertain.\nThere are many ways in which the conventional use of a term can be understood. Sometimes the conventional use of a term is clear. Sometimes it is not.\nThe term virtue could be used in different ways. For example, it might be used to refer to a variety of behaviors that make people happy.

These laws include statements about speed, pressure, and density of the fluid.\nSOLUTION: Hobbes claims that all of the laws of nature can be summarized in the precept: do not do to another what you would not have done to yourself. This means that you should treat others as you would like to be treated.\nThis precept is not the same as maximizing happiness. For example, being kind to others is often wise, but it does not always maximize happiness. Being kind to a friend can make both people happier, but being kind to a person who is mean to you can make you unhappier."}

This feedback reinforces the connection between the behavior and the virtue, so that the person begins to feel internal pressure to behave virtuously."}

Obligations can be either agent-relative or agent-neutral.\nAn agent-relative obligation is an obligation that depends on the specific agent. For any obligation, there might be some agents who have the obligation and other agents who do not. For example, the obligation to pay a parking ticket is agent-relative.\nAn agent-neutral obligation is an obligation that does not depend on the specific agent. If you have an obligation to pay a parking ticket, you do not have the obligation because you are a person. Instead, you have the obligation because you parked your car. Most moral obligations are agent-neutral.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether the obligation to give priority to the welfare of one's children is agent-relative or agent-neutral, consider whether the obligation depends on the specific agent. The obligation to give priority to the welfare of one's children does not depend on the specific agent. Rather, it depends on the fact that you have children.

According to Augustine, human beings have an inclination to do good, but they also have the freedom to choose how they will act.\nBecause human beings are free to choose how they will act, they may choose to act in ways that are contrary to God's will. In Augustine's view, this is what it means to be evil.\nEvil is not a force that can be fought with weapons, according to Augustine. Instead, evil is a choice that a person makes. Because evil is a choice, it is not evil in itself.

In other words, these two parts of Saez's theory are not independent.\nHowever, the fact that two claims are provable from self-evident premises does not necessarily mean that the two claims are interdependent. A claim is independent if it can be accepted or rejected on the basis of other claims. A claim is interdependent with other claims if it can be accepted or rejected only on the basis of those other claims.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether the two parts of Rawls's theory are interdependent, ask whether you can accept one part without accepting the other. You cannot accept Rawls's theory of the original position without accepting his part about the two principles of justice. So, the two parts are not independent."}

In his book The Anthropology of Christianity, G. W. F.

These principles include the unspoken rules of behavior that govern routine social interactions.\nThe taboos are the moral principles that are less tolerated and more extreme than the folkways. These principles include the unspoken rules of behavior that govern less routine social interactions.\nThe lifeway is the moral principle that is so fundamental to a society that it is rarely questioned. This principle includes the unspoken rules of behavior that govern the most routine social interactions.\nA society's moral code has currency in the society only if a high proportion of the adults in the society subscribe to its principles. If most adults in a society do not subscribe to a moral code, that code will not guide the behavior of most people.\nA society's moral code is recognized as the moral code of the society if it is generally accepted as the proper moral code for the society.\nBoth a and b are required.

People have a natural right to do as they please, but if other people have the same right, then their pleasure may conflict with yours. If people decide that they need to reduce the uncertainty and vulnerability of their enjoyment of freedom, they can give up some of their freedom and establish a state with the authority to do what is necessary to reduce uncertainty and vulnerability.\nJohn Locke offers a different account of why people might give up their freedom and establish a state. He argues that in the state of nature, the enjoyment of freedom is uncertain and vulnerable because there is no government to enforce the laws. According to Locke, the state is established to protect people's rights to life, liberty, and property.\nBy giving up their freedom and establishing a state, people can enjoy a higher degree of freedom. In the state of nature, people have the freedom to do as they please, but they are vulnerable to those who do not have the same values. By establishing a state and giving up some of their freedom, people can reduce the risks and uncertainties that they face.

They argue that our experiences provide the sources of the ideas and concepts that make up our knowledge.\nOther philosophers claim that human knowledge is primarily based on reason. They argue that our ability to reason is what allows us to find the ideas and concepts that make up our knowledge.\nYet, even within the philosophy of reason, there are different accounts of how reason contributes to knowledge.\nSome philosophers argue that reason provides the structure for our ideas and concepts. According to this view, reason alone cannot provide knowledge, but it is what makes our experiences and observations meaningful.\nOther philosophers argue that reason can provide the basis for knowledge. According to this view, reason can discover the absolute good, for example, without the assistance of sense experience.\nSOLUTION: In order to show that hypothetical knowledge cannot provide the foundation of dialectical knowledge, Plato indicates that hypotheses simply describe sense experience without providing an explanation for dialectical methods.\nDialectic, in contrast, goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure."}

In order to be used in ethical inquiry, virtues must be defined as descriptive as possible. This means that they must be defined in such a way that they can be observed and measured.\nFor example, if a virtue is defined as kindness, it can be observed in everyday life. A person acts with kindness when she takes the needs of others into account. The term kindness is measured by how a person behaves.\nVirtues are also shaped by cultural and religious beliefs. Different cultures and religions have different names for virtues and may define them in different ways. For example, courage may be defined as standing up to danger in one culture, and as being able to endure pain in another culture.\nBut no matter how a virtue is defined, it should be defined as descriptive as possible. This allows for clear ethical discussions."}

These perspectives are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and they often overlap or are integrated in some way.\nTheory is a set of interconnected ideas that seeks to explain something. In psychology, theories can be used to explain everything from how people think and feel to how they learn and remember.\nSome of the most influential theories in psychology include the following:\nBehaviorism: Behaviorism is a theory of learning that assumes that all thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are acquired during a person's life.\nCognitive psychology: Cognitive psychology is a theory of learning that assumes that some thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are innate (present from birth).\nEvolutionary psychology: Evolutionary psychology is a theory that focuses on how evolution has influenced human behavior.\nSOLUTION: The identity theory is the theory that says mental states are nothing but brain states. This means that the mind and the brain are one and the same.\nThe other theories listed are also theories of the mind. But they do not accept that mental states are nothing but brain states.\nLogical behaviorism is the view that mental states are nothing more than behaviors. But not all behaviors are mental states. For example, going to the store is a behavior, but wanting to go to the store is a mental state.\nEpiphenomenalism is the view that mental states are caused by the brain, but cannot affect the brain.
