It classifies all As into the category B.\nThe major premise of a categorical syllogism takes the form:\nAll A's are B.\nThis is a universal statement. It is true if and only if every A is a B.\nA disjunctive syllogism is a syllogism that uses disjunctive statements. A disjunctive statement is a statement that presents a choice.\nEither A is B, or A is C.\nThis is a disjunctive statement. It presents a choice between A being B and A being C.\nThe major premise of a disjunctive syllogism takes the form:\nEither A is B, or A is C.\nThis is a biconditional statement. It is true if and only if A is B or A is C.\nA conditional syllogism is a syllogism that uses conditional statements. A conditional statement is a statement that presents a condition.\nIf A is B, then A is C.\nThis is a conditional statement. It presents a condition between A being B and A being C.\nThe major premise of a conditional syllogism takes the form:\nIf A is B, then A is C.\nThis is a conditional statement. It is true if and only if A is B implies A is C.\nA hypothetical syllogism is a syllogism that uses hypothetical statements. A hypothetical statement is a statement that presents a condition and a consequence.\nIf A is B, then A is C.\nThis is a conditional statement. It presents a condition and a consequence between A being B and A being C.\nThe major premise of a hypothetical syllogism takes the form:\nIf A is B, then A is C.\nThis is a conditional statement.

Its major premise takes the form:\nAll A's are B.\nThis is a categorical statement. It classifies all As into the category B."}

Fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.\nA slippery-slope fallacy involves the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences. This type of argument is fallacious when it describes a sudden and extreme outcome that is not likely to happen.\nGood authors use valid reasoning and logic in support of their claims. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a fallacy.\nA strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim.

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a fallacy.\nSOLUTION: The first step in this argument is the wrong size and shape. A slippery-slope argument is a type of argument that involves a series of steps. This step is a misrepresentation of the issues at hand. It is a misrepresentation because it omits some of the steps that would be involved in the progression. This argument does not provide a good reason to think that doing one action will inevitably lead to another undesirable action."}

Rejecting a claim by appealing to the person who makes it, rather than the claim itself, is a type of fallacy known as an ad hominem (Latin for \"to the person\").\nAn ad hominem argument might do one of the following:\ncall into question the character of the person making the claim\nappeal to a perceived bias of the person making the claim\nappeal to a perceived motivation of the person making the claim\nThe best way to spot an ad hominem fallacy is to look for an argument that makes a personal attack or appeals to a person's characteristics rather than their claims.\nComposition is the opposite of division. Division involves breaking something up into parts. Composition involves combining parts into a whole.\nA composition fallacy might overgeneralize from a small sample or draw an overly broad conclusion based on too few observations.\nA division fallacy might misrepresent the issues at hand by oversimplifying a complex situation.\nSOLUTION: Rejecting a claim by appealing to the person who makes it is an appeal to the person. This type of argument fallacy involves a personal attack that is not relevant to the claim."}

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a fallacy.\nA fallacy can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.\nAmphiboly is a type of fallacy that occurs when a statement has more than one possible interpretation.\nWhen a statement is ambiguous, it can be misinterpreted, and that can lead to a fallacy. For example, the claim \"The average person gains 10 pounds in 10 years\" is ambiguous. It doesn't specify what average person and what 10 years. This ambiguity can be misinterpreted to go on for 10 years. But that's not what the claim means.\nSOLUTION: The claim is ambiguous. The second answer choice is correct.\nThe text uses ambiguous language, and that ambiguity can be misinterpreted. For example, the phrase \"the same act committed by the arguer or supporters in favorable terms\" is ambiguous. It doesn't specify what the arguer or supporters think about the act. This ambiguity can be misinterpreted to think that the arguer or supporters think the act is okay."}
