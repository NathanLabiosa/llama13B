As blood passes through the blood capillaries, waste and excess substances from the blood enter the nephric space.\nThe nephron is composed of several parts. Each part is surrounded by a capsule.\nThe blood capillaries are surrounded by the afferent arteriole and the efferent arteriole. The afferent arteriole brings blood to the nephrons. The efferent arteriole takes blood away from the nephrons.\nThe glomerulus is a ball-shaped cluster of blood capillaries. The glomerulus is surrounded by the renal capsule. The renal capsule surrounds the glomerulus.\nThe loop of Henle is a tube-shaped structure. The loop of Henle reabsorbs water and shifts solutes from the nephric space into the blood.\nThe distal convoluted tubule and the proximal convoluted tubule are parts of the nephron. These tubules reabsorb water and solutes from the nephric space into the blood.\nThe collecting ducts collect waste water and waste solutes from the nephric space.

It is constantly growing and changing.\nThe bones of the skull, for example, do not stop growing at birth. Instead, they continue to grow slowly during a person's life.\nThe growth of bones is called remodeling. During remodeling, old bone is absorbed by the body, and new bone is formed.\nThe bones of the mandible (the bone that forms the lower jaw) grow in response to muscle activity. The mandible contains a thick section of bone at each end. These sections are called the condyles.\nDuring a person's development, the mandible grows in response to the activity of the muscles that attach to the mandible. After a person has grown into an adult, the condyles remain the same size. But the bone just in front of the condyles can continue to grow. This allows the mandible to move forward.\nSOLUTION: The mental symphysis grows together at about 1 year of age. So, the mental symphysis closes at about 1 year postnatally.\nThe condylar growth cartilage ceases activity at puberty. So, the condylar growth cartilage does not grow during puberty.\nThe ossification center appears about 8 weeks I.U.L medial to Meckel's cartilage. So, the ossification center appears in the bone at the back of the mandible.\nThe functional matrix acting on the angle of the mandible is the lateral pterygoid muscle. The functional matrix is a special type of bone that forms in response to a muscle. So, the muscle called the lateral pterygoid is linked to the growth of the mandible."}

They remove waste substances from the blood and regulate the balance of water and chemicals in the blood.\nThe nephrons are the filtering units of the kidneys. The blood flows through the afferent arterioles of the nephrons, and waste substances pass through the walls of the blood vessels and into the nephrons. The first part of the nephron is the glomerulus, which acts as a filter. The blood vessels in the glomerulus have walls that expand and allow waste substances to pass through. The waste substances then enter the tubules of the nephron.\nThe tubules are the site of waste substance removal. Cells in the tubules reabsorb chemicals that are important for the body and filter out waste substances. The waste substances are then removed from the body by the ureters.\nThe conditions that affect the nephrons can cause kidney problems.\nGlomerulonephritis is a condition in which the glomeruli in the kidneys become inflamed. This can be caused by autoimmune diseases or infections.\nInterstitial nephritis is a condition in which the tissues of the kidneys become inflamed. This can be caused by infections or reactions to drugs.\nPolycystic kidney is a condition in which many cysts form in the kidneys.

The part of the oscillation where the muscle relaxes is called the inactive portion.\nA muscle's active portion occurs during an oscillation.

The senses perform two important functions: sensing and perception.\nSensing is the process of detecting stimuli. A stimulus is any matter or energy that causes a sensory organ to respond. The senses perform different sensing functions. For example, seeing is a function of the eyes. Hearing is a function of the ears. Smelling is a function of the nose.\nPerception is the process of interpreting a stimulus. Interpretation involves organizing and making sense of the information that has been sensed. Perception is different for each sense. For example, seeing a object involves interpreting the information that the eyes have sensed. Hearing a sound involves interpreting the information that the ears have sensed.\nThe brainstem is a pathway for sensory information. The sensory organs in the head send sensory information to the brainstem. The brainstem sends this information to the rest of the brain for interpretation.\nThe rest of the brain is responsible for perceiving and processing sensory information. Different areas of the brain perceive and process sensory information. For example, the visual cortex is responsible for processing visual information. The auditory cortex is responsible for processing auditory information.\nSOLUTION: The tongue is a sensory organ. The tongue has different areas that are responsible for detecting different tastes. The areas of the tongue are called taste fields.\nThe tip of the tongue is a taste field for sweet tastes. The back of the tongue is a taste field for bitter tastes. The sides of the tongue are taste fields for sour tastes. The base of the tongue is a taste field for salty tastes.\nThe anterior two-thirds of the tongue is responsible for detecting tastes. The posterior one-third of the tongue is responsible for detecting bitter tastes.\nThe lingual nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve. The lingual nerve carries sensory information from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue to the brainstem.\nThe chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve. The chorda tympani carries taste information from the front two-thirds of the tongue.\nThe glossopharyngeal nerve is a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve carries taste information from the back of the tongue.\nThe hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve. The hypoglossal nerve controls the muscles of the tongue."}
