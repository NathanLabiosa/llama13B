Some scientists think that there are many more viruses that have not been discovered.\nViruses are not cells. They cannot replicate themselves. Instead, they enter cells and use the cells' machinery to make new viruses.\nViruses have genetic material called DNA or RNA. But they do not have all the machinery that cells have. So, they cannot replicate their genetic material without help.\nA virus enters a cell by binding to it. The virus then releases its genetic material into the cell. The cell's machinery uses the genetic material to make new viruses. The new viruses spread through the cell. Eventually, the cell bursts, releasing the new viruses.\nSOLUTION: At present, there are 100 human polyomaviruses known.\nHuman polyomaviruses are a group of viruses that can infect humans. In recent years, scientists have identified 100 of these viruses."}

There are several types of bias.\nSelection bias can occur when the pool of subjects for a study is not representative of the population of interest. For example, if a study on smoking cessation only includes people who can afford to pay for cessation classes, then the results may not be generally applicable to people who cannot afford to pay for such classes.\nObservational bias can occur when subjects or researchers have different experiences or information during a study. For example, if one group of subjects is diagnosed after a more thorough examination than the other group, then the group that is diagnosed after a more thorough examination may have a different prevalence of disease than the other group.\nConfounding can occur when there are differences between groups in the other variables that are related to both the exposure and the outcome. For example, if sedentary behavior is related to both alcohol consumption and the risk of developing a disease, then controlling for sedentary behavior may remove the association between alcohol consumption and the risk of developing the disease.\nNonresponse bias can occur when respondents are not representative of the population of interest. For example, if respondents to a survey have a different risk of disease than nonrespondents, then responding to the survey may be related to the risk of disease.\nThe placebo effect occurs when people get better after taking a dummy treatment.

A fever is not an infection itself.\nTo diagnose an infection, doctors test for the actual cause of the fever. They do this by looking for the pathogen that is causing the infection. A pathogen is a type of germ that causes an infection.\nSOLUTION: The parvovirus family includes viruses that cause disease.

They do this by invading cells in the body and using those cells' machinery to make new viruses.\nVaccines are a key tool in controlling the spread of viral diseases. A vaccine for a virus teaches the immune system how to fight the virus. After the immune system learns about the virus, it can quickly mount a response when the virus is found in the body. This response can prevent the virus from causing disease.\nQuarantine is a method of separating people or animals that are infected with a disease from those who are not. Quarantine can help stop the spread of a disease.\nAntiviral drugs are medicines that can treat infections caused by viruses. They do this by targeting viruses themselves, not the body's response to the virus.\nAttention to handwashing and hygiene is important for controlling the spread of viral diseases. Viruses can be spread by contact with contaminated objects or surfaces. Washing hands frequently can help prevent the spread of viruses.\nSOLUTION: A norovirus vaccine is a vaccine that teaches the immune system how to fight norovirus. A vaccine is the most effective way to control the spread of a virus. So, a norovirus vaccine is the most important for controlling disease caused by norovirus."}

A surveillance study is a type of observational study.\nIn a surveillance study, researchers offer options to participants, but the options are not linked to their health outcomes. That is, participants are not identified in connection with their choices.\nUnlinked anonymous is a surveillance testing strategy in which participants receive a test with no identifying information.\nVoluntary anonymous is a surveillance testing strategy in which participants choose to receive a test with no identifying information.\nVoluntary confidential is a surveillance testing strategy in which participants receive a test with identifying information, but the identifying information is not linked to the participants' health outcomes.\nCompulsory is a surveillance testing strategy in which participants are required to receive a test, and the test is linked to their health outcomes.\nSOLUTION: The least selection bias is obtained with unlinked anonymous testing.

The genetic material can be either DNA or RNA. Viruses do not have all of the parts that cells have. They cannot make their own food. They need a host cell to survive.\nViruses use their protein coat to attach to a host cell. Attachment to a cell is usually specific. Different viruses attach to different cells. This ensures that the virus will infect a cell that it can survive in.\nSome viruses enter cells by fusing their protein coat with the cell membrane. The viral genetic material enters the cell. Other viruses use a more complex process.\nSOLUTION: The Dane particle is a virus. It has a protein coat.\nThe Dane particle does not have a lipid membrane. So, the Dane particle is not a lipid membrane free icosahedron.\nThe Dane particle has a flexuous and filamentous morphology. This means that the Dane particle has a flexible, thread-like shape.\nThe Dane particle is not a double shelled icosahedron. An icosahedron is a twenty-sided shape. A double shelled icosahedron would have a shell within a shell. The Dane particle does not have this shape.\nThe Dane particle is not numerous small particles. The Dane particle is a single particle."}

It is usually expressed as the number of cases per 100,000 people.\nFor example, if a population of 100,000 people has 50 cases of a disease, the prevalence of the disease is 50 cases per 100,000 people.\nSOLUTION: The first step is to find the number of cases per 250,000 people. The prevalence is 400 cases per 250,000 people.\nThe second step is to confirm that 400 is less than 2,500. It is."}

The name of a virus group is made of two words.\nThe first word in a virus group name describes the type of nucleotide in the virus's genome. Nucleotides are the building blocks of genetic material. There are four types of nucleotides: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine.\nThe second word in a virus group name describes the origin of the virus. Origin can include words such as cell, tissue, organ, planet, ocean, and family.\nA virus group's name is made up of the two parts that describe the virus's genetic material and origin. For example, the name of a virus group may include words such as nucleotide, cell, tissue, and organ.\nSOLUTION: Astroviruses are named because of the nucleotide sequence of their genomes. A virus's genetic material contains information about the virus. Scientists can determine the sequence of nucleotides in a virus's genetic material. The sequence can be used to identify the virus."}
