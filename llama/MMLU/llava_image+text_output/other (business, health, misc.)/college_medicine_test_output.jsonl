{"question": "A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? ", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Behaviorist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Psychoanalytic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cognitive behavioral"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Humanistic"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Psychological frameworks are the different ways that psychologists explain human behavior. Each of the following frameworks describes where behavior comes from and how it works.\nBehaviorism: Behaviorism is a psychological framework that assumes that all behavior is gained during a person's life. Behaviorists do not believe in innate behavior (instinct). They also assume that behavior is changed by the consequences it has. So, if a behavior is reinforced (made easier by a consequence), that behavior is likely to happen again. If a behavior is punished (made more difficult by a consequence), that behavior is likely to happen less often.\nPsychoanalytic: The psychoanalytic framework assumes that behavior is gained during a person's life. The framework also assumes that unconscious forces are the driving force behind behavior. Unconscious means not known to consciousness. So, unconscious forces are not in awareness. According to psychoanalysis, unconscious feelings and wishes affect behavior. A person's past experiences also affect unconscious forces.\nCognitive behavioral: The cognitive behavioral framework assumes that behavior is gained during a person's life. This framework also assumes that unconscious thoughts and feelings are not the driving force behind behavior. Instead, conscious thoughts and feelings are what drive behavior. So, a person's thoughts and feelings at the time of behavior can affect the behavior.\nHumanistic: The humanistic framework assumes that behavior is gained during a person's life. Unlike behaviorism, humanism believes that people are born with an innate drive to grow and learn. This drive is called motivation. According to humanism, a person's motivation affects their behavior.\nSOLUTION: This police officer's behavior is affected by unconscious bias. It is tied to the officer's childhood and his relationship with his father. So, the cognitive behavioral framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": ""}

Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate that is stored in a person's muscles and liver. The amount of glycogen in a person's muscles is directly related to the amount of carbohydrates in the person's diet.\nThe duration of a race is the time that a race lasts. The maximum sustainable power that a person can generate during a race is lower when the race is longer. This is because the person's muscles use glycogen as fuel. When the person's muscles use up their glycogen, the person's muscles can no longer make the power that they were making before.\nSOLUTION: The maximum sustainable power that a person can generate during a race is inversely related to muscle glycogen content.

The frequency of a sound is measured in hertz (Hz). One hertz refers to one cycle per second.\nA low frequency sound has a pitch that is low and quiet, while a high frequency sound has a pitch that is high and bright.\nThe frequency of a sound affects how quickly the sound waves are moving. The speed of sound waves increases as the frequency of the sound increases.\nSOLUTION: The frequency of the gunshot is affected by the platform's speed. The platform's speed changes the speed of the sound wave.\nThe frequency of the gunshot is normally 800 Hz. To find the perceived frequency, consider the following:\nThe gunshot came from an actor inside a car traveling 108 km/h.\nThe camera was on a platform that was traveling 72 km/h in the same direction.\nThe platform's speed affects the frequency of the gunshot. The frequency of the gunshot that the camera picks up is lower than the normal frequency of 800 Hz. It is 924 Hz."}

{"question": "Two scientists at a conference on evolution take to the stage on day 3 to argue their theories against one other. Each is a devout student of their own philosophy. The first scientist contends that organisms evolved via the increase of organs that were used the most during their time. They would then pass these on to subsequent generations. The second scientist, however, believed that advantages each organism possessed were absent for a long time, randomly occurred, and when they were beneficial, that organism would rapidly populate the population over a short period of time, evolutionarily speaking.

Taxonomy is the study of how organisms are related to each other.\nTaxonomy involves constructing a classification, or a system of groups, for organisms. Classification is based on the similarities and differences between organisms. Scientists compare the traits of organisms to other organisms. Scientists classify organisms with similar traits into groups.\nThe table below shows some ways that organisms can be classified.\nClass | Organisms |\nMammal | whale |\nbird | eagle |\nreptile | snake |\namphibian | frog |\nfish | shark |\nScientists also use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus.

This internal environment includes the levels of important substances such as sugar, salt, and pH.\nThe body uses enzymes and other proteins to regulate the levels of these substances. These proteins are involved in reactions that either produce or consume other substances. In doing so, they help maintain the levels of substances within the desired range.\nThe activity of an enzyme depends on its conditions. For any enzyme, the highest rate of reaction occurs when the enzyme's conditions are within a certain range. If the conditions are outside this range, the enzyme's rate of reaction will be lower than it could be.\nAn enzyme's conditions include the enzyme's temperature, pH, and the presence of other molecules. For example, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is involved in the body's acid-base balance, has a high rate of reaction at a pH of 7.4. But it has a lower rate of reaction at a pH of 6.8 and a higher rate of reaction at a pH of 7.8.\nSOLUTION: Creatine kinase is an enzyme that helps maintain the levels of creatine phosphate in the muscles.\nThe activity of creatine kinase is increased after a period of endurance training. This allows the muscles to use creatine phosphate more effectively.\nThe activity of creatine kinase is always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres. Type II fibres do not use creatine phosphate to produce energy.\nThe activity of creatine kinase is increased when intracellular ADP rises. When the level of ADP in the muscle rises, the muscle uses more creatine phosphate to produce energy.\nThe activity of creatine kinase is increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9. When the muscle becomes too acidic, the activity of creatine kinase increases in order to restore the muscle to a normal pH."}

What role does surfactant play in facilitating oxygen diffusion?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increases surface permeability"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Maintains alveoli in an open state"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Depresses cilia of the lung"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dilates blood vessels"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Surfactant is a substance that is produced by the lung cells. Its primary function is to reduce surface tension within the alveoli. The reduced surface tension allows the alveoli to expand properly, and the lung cells can breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.\nSurfactant also helps to prevent the alveoli from collapsing. When the lung cells breathe in, the surfactant spreads across the alveoli and breaks the surface tension. This causes the alveoli to expand. When the lung cells breathe out, the surfactant does not spread across the alveoli. This allows the alveoli to collapse and use fewer oxygen and carbon dioxide.\nSOLUTION: Surfactant plays the following role in facilitating oxygen diffusion:\nIt maintains the alveoli in an open state.\nThe alveoli are open when the lung cells breathe in. This allows oxygen to enter the blood vessels. When the lung cells breathe out, the alveoli collapse. This uses fewer oxygen and carbon dioxide."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, what would be an important thing for a person to do after sauna use?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shower in cold water."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exercise."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eat a meal."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Replenish fluids with filtered water."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Look for the important thing to do after sauna use.\nThe article says that after sauna use, it is important to shower in cold water.

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner.

This can help scientists determine the function of a particular RNA. One way RNA sequencing predicts structure is by comparing the sequence to a database of known RNA structures.\nOne type of RNA that can be hard to predict is a transfer RNA (tRNA). tRNAs have a specific role in cells: they bring amino acids to a ribosome to be assembled into a protein. There are many different types of tRNAs, and their sequences can be quite different. But the sequences of all tRNAs follow a few basic rules.\nFor example, the sequence of a tRNA usually contains the following elements:\nA clear beginning and end, marked by the symbols 5' and 3'.\nA central loop that is not followed by any more nucleotides.\nThe nucleotide uracil instead of thymine.\nThe rules for tRNA sequences are important to follow because they are used to assign a function to a particular RNA.\nSOLUTION: The modification in the RNA strand affects the rules for tRNA sequences.

Each stage is characterized by a source of pleasure and a sense of independence.\nThe oral stage is from birth to about 18 months. The source of pleasure is the mouth, and the sense of independence is linked to the infant's ability to explore the world through his or her mouth.\nThe anal stage is from 18 months to about 3 years. The source of pleasure is the rectum, and the sense of independence is linked to the infant's ability to control bowel movements.\nThe phallic stage is from 3 to 6 years of age. The source of pleasure is the genitals, and the sense of independence is linked to the child's ability to urinate and defecate on demand.\nThe latency stage is from 6 to 12 years of age. The source of pleasure is the social interactions with others, and the sense of independence is linked to the child's ability to develop social relationships with peers.\nThe genital stage is during adolescence. The source of pleasure is the genitals, and the sense of independence is linked to the teenager's ability to form adult relationships.\nAn issue with the young man's housekeeping is a concern about his ability to be organized and plan ahead. These abilities are important for many tasks, including maintaining a clean house. In Freudian terms, the young man might be fixated in the phallic stage.\nThe phallic stage is associated with concerns about cleanliness and order. A child in this stage may develop a sense of shame or guilt about dirty behavior or thoughts. According to Freud, these concerns come from the child's awareness of being a separate person.\nSOLUTION: A fixation is when a person gets stuck in a particular stage of development. A young man who is fixated in the phallic stage may have difficulty with self-discipline and may be preoccupied with cleanliness and order. These problems could be linked to the young man's inability to keep his house clean."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nWhich of the following is a likely paragraph that follows this excerpt in the article?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A paragraph on a protein that facilitates intracellular function in response to heat."}, {"label": "B", "text": "A paragraph on increased heart attacks in Eskimo populations."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A recap of Finland\u2019s water polo team excellence."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A study on rats exposed to high levels of heat."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": ""}

{"question": "In nerve cells, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), most notably MAP2 and MAP tau, act to stabilize microtubules.

Which cellular activity would likely be most affected?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cardiac muscle contraction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Transcription of mRNA from DNA"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Krebs cycle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Meiosis"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: MAPs are involved in a variety of cellular activities. They can act as plus-end binding proteins and/or minus-end binding proteins. Plus-end binding proteins can slow the growth of microtubules. Minus-end binding proteins can facilitate microtubule depolymerization.\nWhen MAPs are removed, the number of detyrosinated microtubules increases. Detyrosinated microtubules are more likely to depolymerize. So, the absence of MAPs would lead to an increase in microtubule depolymerization.\nTranscription of mRNA from DNA is a process that occurs during interphase. This diagram shows the stages of the cell cycle.\nThe cell cycle is made up of four stages: G1, S, G2, and M. During G1, the cell grows and prepares for DNA replication. During S, the cell replicates its DNA. During G2, the cell prepares for mitosis. During M, the cell divides.\nIn animal cells, interphase occupies about 99% of the time in the cell cycle. Most transcription occurs in the G1 and S phases.\nThe Krebs cycle, also known as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is a process that occurs in the mitochondria. It helps break down sugar and release energy that the cell can use.\nThe cycle starts with an acid called citrate. Citrate gets broken down to make a sugar called isocitrate. Isocitrate is then broken down to make another sugar, alpha-ketoglutarate. Alpha-ketoglutarate is broken down to make succinyl-CoA.\nSuccinyl-CoA can be used in place of glucose to generate ATP. Glucose is a sugar that cells use to generate ATP.\nOxygen is needed to break down the acids in the Krebs cycle. When oxygen is present, the acids are completely broken down. When oxygen is not present, the breakdown is incomplete.\nIn the absence of oxygen, a different pathway is used to generate ATP. This pathway is called anaerobic respiration.\nMeiosis is a process that occurs in cells in the germ cells, the cells that go on to become eggs and sperm. Meiosis is what happens when a cell uses its DNA to make four daughter cells.\nDuring meiosis, the homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material. The chromosomes then separate and go to opposite poles of the cell.\nWhen eggs and sperm are formed, they contain half as much genetic material as the original cell. This is because each of the homologous chromosomes splits in half during meiosis."}

The breakdown involves multiple steps. One of the steps is glycolysis, which means \"the breakdown of glucose.\" Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell.\nDuring glycolysis, glucose is converted to two molecules of a compound called pyruvate. Pyruvate is the input for glycolysis.\nThe reaction rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions are determined by the enzyme's kinetic properties. The rate at which an enzyme acts depends on its rate limiting step. The rate limiting step is the slowest step in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction.\nAn enzyme's rate limiting step is often determined by the rate at which the enzyme gains access to its substrate. The rate at which an enzyme gains access to its substrate is determined by the type of substrate binding.\nSubstrate binding can be described as irreversible or reversible. Irreversible substrate binding means that the substrate must be bound before the enzyme can begin to act. Reversible substrate binding means that the substrate can bind to the enzyme before the enzyme begins to act.\nSome enzymes have a rate limiting step with irreversible substrate binding. These enzymes can bind to their substrate only once. After the substrate is bound, the enzyme changes its shape to begin acting on the substrate.\nSome enzymes have a rate limiting step with reversible substrate binding. These enzymes can bind to their substrate before they begin to act."}

The main source of energy for the cell is ATP. ATp is replenished by the breakdown of glucose and other molecules.\nDuring high intensity exercise, the cell's demand for ATP increases. But the rate of ATP replenishment does not keep up with the cell's demand. So, the cell concentration of ATP in the cell falls.\nThis fall in the cell concentration of ATP is a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. It is caused by a decrease in the breakdown of glucose and other molecules.\nSOLUTION: Failure of the ATP supply to match the demand is a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. As exercise intensity increases, the cell's demand for ATP increases. But the rate of ATP production does not increase as quickly. So, the cell concentration of ATP falls.\nLack of skill is not a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise.\nA fall in the cell concentration of ADP is not a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. The cell concentration of ADP does not directly cause fatigue. But it does indirectly cause fatigue. As the cell concentration of ADP falls, the cell is unable to use ADP to make more ATP. This increase the demand for ATP, and the rate of ATP breakdown increases.\nInhibition of ATP production is not a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. High intensity exercise increases the demand for ATP. But the rate of ATP production does not decrease."}

When your body has immunity to a disease, it has become resistant to that disease.\nActive immunity happens when you have had a disease and your body has learned to fight it. After you have had a disease, your body will usually keep a supply of antibodies on hand. These antibodies can fight the disease again if you are exposed to it in the future.\nPassive immunity happens when you are given antibodies that your body can use to fight a disease. This type of immunity does not last as long as active immunity.\nNatural immunity is when your body naturally fights a disease. Some people have natural immunity to certain diseases.\nArtificial immunity is when you are given antibodies to help fight a disease. The antibodies are made by animals rather than by your own body.\nSOLUTION: The patient is given a serum that contains rabies antibodies. This is an example of artificial immunity. The patient's body is not naturally fighting the disease. Instead, the patient is being given antibodies to help fight the disease."}

The primary energy source for muscle contraction is adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\nOxidative phosphorylation is the process used by cells to convert food into ATP. This process is also known as cellular respiration.\nDuring oxidative phosphorylation, the food we eat is broken down into a compound called acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is then broken down in a series of reactions that convert it into ATP.\nAll cells use oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Because muscle cells have a high energy demand, they use a lot of ATP. So, cells need a way to rapidly produce ATP. This is where phosphocreatine comes in.\nPhosphocreatine is a compound that, when broken down, produces ATP. Muscle cells can use phosphocreatine to rapidly produce ATP during muscle contraction. But phosphocreatine is not a long-term energy source. It is used during very intense muscle contractions.\nATP, on the other hand, is the primary energy source for muscle contraction. Muscles cannot function without a constant supply of ATP.\nWhen ATP is broken down, a phosphate group is removed. This leaves ADP. The body can change ADP back into ATP. During muscle contraction, the body uses this process to produce more ATP."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nAccording to the article, which of the following is NOT a benefit of sauna use?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decreased risk of heart attacks."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increase in stroke volume."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Improved mental health."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decreased rate of erectile dysfunction."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Look at the underlined text.\nThe KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.

A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.\nThe force driving the water through the hose is the pressure of the water. The pressure is caused by the weight of the water. The weight of the water is called the hydrostatic pressure.\nA change in an object's velocity means that the object's speed has changed.

Enzymes have several kinetic parameters, but the most important ones for understanding enzyme kinetics are:\nVmax: the maximum rate at which an enzyme can act. Vmax does not depend on the concentration of the enzyme.\nKm: the Michaelis constant. The Km is a measure of the concentration of the enzyme's substrate that leads to half of the maximum rate. When the substrate concentration is equal to the Km, the enzyme is acting at its maximum rate.\nSOLUTION: Look for the statement that is false.\nPhosphorylase activity is higher in Type II fibres than in Type I fibres.\nThis statement is false. Phosphorylase activity is the same in Type I and Type II fibres.\nEndurance training increases the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle.\nThis statement is false. Endurance training does not increase the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle.\nThe TCA cycle is a series of chemical reactions that produce ATP. Oxygen is consumed in the TCA cycle.\nThis statement is false. Oxygen is not consumed in the TCA cycle.\nPhosphofructokinase is the rate limiting enzyme in glycolysis.\nThis statement is false. Phosphofructokinase is not the rate limiting enzyme in glycolysis."}
