Mitochondria do this by converting sugar into ATP through a process called cellular respiration.\nCellular respiration has several steps. One of these steps is the Krebs' cycle, also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This cycle occurs in the mitochondrial inner membrane.\nAnother step of cellular respiration is the electron transport chain, also located in the mitochondrial inner membrane.

For example, inhaled medications are delivered directly to the lungs, and injected medications are delivered directly to the bloodstream. The route of administration of a medication affects both its effectiveness and its side effects.\nFor example, an inhaled medication for a respiratory disease must reach the lungs to have the desired effect. An injected medication for a lingering headache must reach the bloodstream to have the desired effect.\nSOLUTION: Morphine is a medication that is used to treat pain.\nMorphine can be administered by different routes, including injection and patch.\nNo matter how morphine is administered, it acts directly on the central nervous system to reduce the perception of pain. However, morphine can also have side effects, depending on how it is administered.\nIf you are given morphine in a pill or a capsule, it is absorbed through the digestive system. Swallowing the pill or capsule whole will reduce the side effects of morphine. Chewing the pill or capsule can increase the side effects of morphine.\nMorphine can cause sedation, which means it can make you feel sleepy. Morphine can also cause nausea and vomiting.\nIf you are given morphine in a liquid form, it can be administered by mouth or by injection. The liquid form of morphine is less likely to cause sedation. But the liquid form of morphine can cause nausea and vomiting.\nInhaled morphine is a new way to administer morphine.

A buffer is a substance that resists a change in pH when a strong acid or base is added to it.\nWhen cells need to regulate their pH, they can use both intracellular and extracellular buffers.\nA graph of the relationship between the concentration of a buffer and its pH shows that the pH does not change much when the concentration of the buffer is relatively low. However, when the concentration of the buffer is higher, the pH changes less than it would otherwise.\nSOLUTION: A high rate of glycolysis can increase the cell's demand for energy. To help meet this demand, glutamine can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes.\nGlutamine is a strong buffer, and its pKa is around 6.5. This means that glutamine can resist a change in pH when a strong acid or base is added to it.\nCarnosine is a weaker buffer, and its pKa is around 5.5. So, when the rate of glycolysis is high, carnosine may not be able to limit pH changes effectively.\nGlucose is a weak acid, and its pKa is around 5.2.

Its function may involve structures that are part of the organ. For example, the function of the heart is to pump blood. The heart is made up of the heart muscle, which is also called the myocardium. The myocardium is made up of cardiac muscle cells.\nThe function of the pancreas is to secrete digestive enzymes into the small intestine and secrete insulin into the blood. The pancreas has two types of cells: exocrine cells and endocrine cells.\nExocrine cells secrete substances into the small intestine. The exocrine cells in the pancreas secrete digestive enzymes into the small intestine.\nEndocrine cells secrete hormones into the blood. The endocrine cells in the pancreas secrete insulin into the blood.\nSOLUTION: The pancreas secretes insulin. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels."}

The cell membrane also protects the cell from the outside environment.\nThe cytoplasm is made up of a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell membrane. The cytoplasm supports the other cell parts and holds them in place. Many important chemical reactions happen in the cytoplasm.\nThe mitochondria break down sugar to release energy that the cell can use.\nThe vacuoles store nutrients, such as sugar, in the cell. Vacuoles also store water and waste.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities. It does this by sending instructions to different parts of the cell.\nThe chromosomes contain the information that the cell uses for growth and activities. In animal and plant cells, the chromosomes are inside the nucleus.\nSOLUTION: Phosphocreatine is a substance that helps move nutrients into the cell. It is found in the cytoplasm."}
