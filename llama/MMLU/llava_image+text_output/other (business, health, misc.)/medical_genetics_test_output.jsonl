This changes the position of the genes within the two chromosomes.\nWhen a Robertsonian translocation occurs, the centromeres remain on the same chromosomes. The centromeres are the parts of the chromosomes that include the proteins called histones. These proteins make it possible for the chromosomes to be bent, shaped like a capital H.\nIn the long arms of the chromosomes, the genes are moved. Their position will change relative to the centromeres.\nSome of the genes will be moved to the opposite arms of the chromosomes. Other genes will remain on the same arms.\nSOLUTION: In a Robertsonian translocation, the centromeres do not move. So, the centromeres remain on the same chromosomes.\nThe ends of the long arms are the parts of the chromosomes that are farthest from the centromeres. In a Robertsonian translocation, the genes in the ends of the long arms are not moved.\nHistones are proteins that are part of chromosomes.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different forms, or alleles, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The pattern of inheritance of malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is autosomal dominant. This means that an organism with at least one dominant allele for the gene that controls malignant hyperthermia will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, an organism with at least one dominant allele for the malignant hyperthermia gene will have malignant hyperthermia."}

This process is called genotyping.\nThere are many ways to do genotyping. One way is to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR can be used to make many copies of a gene. Then, the locations of the genes can be determined by comparing the copies to the known location of a different gene.\nAnother way to do genotyping is to use quantitative traits. Quantitative traits are traits whose genes affect the risk of developing a disease or condition. (These traits are also called quantitative trait loci, or QTL.)\nA QTL is a chromosome region that contains one or more genes that affect a quantitative trait. Because QTLs contain genes that affect the trait, the locations of QTLs can be used to identify genes that are associated with the trait.\nFor example, if a QTL is associated with an increase in blood cholesterol, then genes within that QTL will increase the risk of high blood cholesterol.\nTo identify the chromosome region associated with a complex trait, researchers perform a genetic cross. In a genetic cross, scientists examine how the offspring of a cross display the trait.\nThe display of the trait by the offspring is called the phenotype. The phenotype is scored, or rated, for each offspring. The scored phenotype is called a phenotypic value.\nSome of the offspring will have phenotypic values that are close to the mean of the parents' phenotypic values. These offspring are said to have a phenotype that is close to the mean.\nThe region between the parents' chromosomes that contains the gene(s) affecting the trait is called a QTL.

In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: If both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder, then each parent has at least one recessive allele for the disorder. So, each parent's genotype has at least one recessive allele.\nAn organism with at least one recessive allele for a gene is affected with the recessive form of the disorder.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: A mutation in the repressor associated with the lac operon of E. coli which prevents binding of the repressor to lactose should result in expression of the genes only when lactose is present. This is because the repressor is typically in the deactivated form when lactose is present.\nThe presence of lactose causes a change in the repressor that converts it to the activated form. The activated repressor can then bind to the operator and shut off transcription of the lac genes. So, in the absence of lactose, the genes are not expressed. But in the presence of lactose, the genes are expressed."}

This difference is important in understanding how drugs that are metabolized by esterification can affect pseudocholinesterase.\nPseudocholinesterase is an enzyme that breaks down esters. When pseudocholinesterase comes across an ester, it cleaves, or breaks, the ester into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.\nSOLUTION: Halothane is a volatile liquid anesthetic that is metabolized by esterification.

The codons are the recipes for building amino acids.\nmRNA is modified with a 5' cap and a 3' poly A tail. The 5' cap helps the RNA polymerase get started transcribing the gene. The 3' poly A tail contributes to the stability of the mRNA. An mRNA with a 3' poly A tail is less likely to be degrades. Degradation is the breakdown of a molecule.\nThe intron is a region of the gene that is transcribed, but it is removed by a process called splicing. Each intron is removed by a specific spliceosome. After splicing, the remaining exons are joined by a process called ligation to form a mature mRNA.\nThe ribosome binding site is the region of the mRNA to which ribosomes bind. Ribosomes are made up of RNA and proteins. They play a key role in protein synthesis.\nSOLUTION: The intron is a region of the gene that is transcribed, but it is removed by a process called splicing. Each intron is removed by a specific spliceosome. After splicing, the remaining exons are joined by a process called ligation to form a mature mRNA.\nThe 5' cap and the 3' poly A tail are added to the mRNA after transcription.

For example, cells in the skin cover the outside of the body. Cells in the lungs help you breathe. Cells in the blood vessels control access to parts of the body.\nBecause cells have different roles to play, cells from different areas of the body may be specialized in different ways. For example, skin cells and blood vessel cells are specialized in different ways. But which cells are specialized in which ways may differ from person to person.\nSOLUTION: Mosaicism is the presence of two or more cell lines from different zygotes in a single individual. Mosaicism is a condition in which there are two or more populations of cells with different genotypes within an individual.\nMosaicism can arise during embryonic development, before birth. A zygote divides into two cells. These two cells then divide again and again. Each division has the potential to produce new cells with different genotypes. If these new cells are not compatible with the old cells, the result is mosaicism.\nDiploidy is a condition in which an organism's cells have twice the haploid number of chromosomes. Diploid cells have 2 copies of each chromosome.\nA cell is said to be diploid if it has two copies of each chromosome. In diploid cells, each chromosome encodes the same genes as in haploid cells. But diploid cells may have different alleles, or forms, of each gene.\nAneuploidy is a condition in which an organism's cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes. An organism with aneuploidy may have too many or too few chromosomes.\nA cell is said to be aneuploid if it has an abnormal number of chromosomes. Aneuploid cells may have extra or missing genes. Extra or missing genes may be the cause of genetic disorders.\nChimaerism is the presence of two or more different types of cells in an organism. Chimaerism is a condition in which an organism has two or more different populations of cells.\nEach cell in an organism has its own genotype. So, each cell is a separate population of cells. If an organism has two or more different populations of cells, the organism has chimaerism."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Autozygosity mapping is used to map disorders that show which pattern of inheritance?\nThe answer is autosomal recessive. An autosomal recessive disorder is caused by alleles on chromosomes that are not sex chromosomes. These alleles can be either dominant or recessive. An organism with a recessive allele for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene."}
