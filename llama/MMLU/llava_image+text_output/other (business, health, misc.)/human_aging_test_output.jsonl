Two of the most well-known theories are the programmed and unprogrammed theories.\nProgrammed theories attribute senescence to a predetermined plan. These theories suggest that the aging of an organism is controlled by its genes.\nUnprogrammed theories attribute senescence to environmental factors. These theories suggest that aging is caused by the external environment.\nSOLUTION: A programmed theory of senescence claims that the aging of an organism is controlled by its genes. This theory relies heavily on computer models. But these models are based on scientific observations. So, programmed theories are not too difficult to test."}

An age group is a cohort of people who are roughly the same age.\nCohorts often differ in their rates of adopting new ideas or inventions. For example, people in older cohorts may be slower to adopt social media than people in younger cohorts. But as people in older cohorts get older, their rates of adopting new ideas may increase.\nSOLUTION: Experts estimate that about 10% of people in their 70s have dementia. By their 90s, about 30% have dementia. So, rates of dementia differ by age group.\nPersonality traits do not change much over a person's life. So, personality traits do not differ much by age group.\nWork productivity is a difference that seems to be mostly cohort. People in older cohorts may be more productive, because they have more experience.\nCoping strategies are different ways of dealing with stress. Different age groups may have different coping strategies. For example, older people may cope with stress by exercising, while younger people may cope with stress by meditating."}

This means that in our culture, being young is often perceived as better than being old. For example, society tends to value youth and attractiveness more than aging and ugliness.\nOn the other hand, negative age stereotypes are harder to change than positive ones. When older people are called wise, they are often praised. But when older people are called useless, they are often criticized. This shows that negative stereotypes have a stronger effect on people's thoughts and actions."}

For example, the thickness of your skin increases as you age because of mechanistic changes in the layers of your skin.\nContinuous changes are caused by the environment. For example, sitting in the sun causes your skin to darken as a result of a continuous change.\nOrganismal changes are caused by the organism itself. For example, exercising regularly can help you build muscle and change the way your body looks and functions.\nNurturant changes are caused by the organism's interactions with the environment. For example, eating less can help you lose weight.\nSOLUTION: Changes in the reproductive system are more organismic for men but not for women. As men and women age, their reproductive systems change. But these changes are not continuous across ages. Instead, they are different between men and women."}

Cohort effects can occur when members of a cohort have different rates of a certain health problem at a certain age. For example, depression. The risk of depression is higher in older people than in younger people. But birth year is also a factor. People who were born in the same years may have a higher or lower risk of depression than other people.\nSome health problems are not caused by cohort effects. These health problems are the same across different birth cohorts.\nFor example, alcoholism. The risk of alcoholism is not higher in older people than in younger people. So, birth year is not a factor.\nOther health problems are caused by both cohort effects and other factors.\nFor example, dementia. The risk of dementia is higher in older people than in younger people. But the risk is higher for people who were born in certain years than for people who were born in other years.\nSo, dementia is a cohort effect.\nDifferences in suicide rates between cohorts can be caused by changes in societal factors.\nFor example, the rates of suicide went up during World War II and went down in the 1990 s. So, suicide is not a cohort effect."}

Men are more likely to engage in physical violence, and women are more likely to engage in verbal violence. People who engage in these behaviors are at risk for negative health outcomes.\nIn addition, men and women have different hormones. Hormones are chemicals that control the body's growth and development. Men have higher levels of testosterone, a hormone that can affect aggression.\nResearchers also know that men and women have different proportions who smoke.

These changes may be caused by aging, lifestyle choices, or diseases.\nAs you age, you may lose muscle. This loss of muscle is called sarcopenia. Sarcopenia can be caused by a number of factors, including loss of neurons. Neurons are nerve cells that send messages between your brain and muscles.\nLoss of collagen. Collagen is a protein that makes up connective tissue. As you age, your body may produce less collagen. This can make your connective tissue less elastic and prone to damage.\nChanges in hormone levels. Hormones are chemicals that regulate your body's processes. As you age, your body may produce hormones in different amounts. For example, older adults may produce less growth hormone. Growth hormone helps your body build muscle.\nLoss of bone density. Bone density is a measure of how thick your bones are. As you age, you may lose bone density. This can make your bones weaker and more fragile. Loss of bone density can also be caused by diseases such as osteoporosis.\nClogged blood vessels. Clogged blood vessels can lead to a decrease in blood flow. This decrease in blood flow can cause muscle tissue to break down.\nSOLUTION: Look for the answer that tells you how loss of muscle fiber may be due to loss of neurons.\nLoss of bone density tells you that loss of muscle fiber may be due to loss of neurons. When you lose bone density, your bones may break down. This can make it hard to stay physically active. Not staying physically active can lead to loss of muscle fiber.\nChanges in hormone levels and loss of collagen can also lead to loss of muscle fiber. But they do not directly cause loss of neurons.\nClogged blood vessels can lead to a decrease in blood flow. This decrease in blood flow can cause muscle tissue to break down. But loss of muscle fiber due to clogged blood vessels is not due to loss of neurons."}

It is based on the theory that some of the behavior of people with dementia is caused by confusion and disorientation. These people may have trouble remembering what has just happened or what is going to happen. They may feel like they are lost or in a place that is unfamiliar.\nValidation therapy involves treating the person with dementia in a way that takes these feelings into account. The caregiver focuses on the present moment and does not try to correct the person's false beliefs. For example, if the person with dementia thinks that the caregiver is someone else, the caregiver will not correct them. Instead, the caregiver will introduce themselves and say where they are.\nSOLUTION: Validation therapy does not involve leaving the person with dementia alone to die peacefully. Instead, it involves treating the person with dementia like a fellow human being."}

Many older adults believe that their memory is worse than it actually is. This type of false belief is called a negative belief.\nOlder adults' negative beliefs about their own memories seem to be more influenced by negative stereotypes about older memory than by their actual performance on memory tests. Stereotypes are general thoughts about groups of people. Stereotypes can be negative or positive. Negative stereotypes about older adults as a group may make older adults believe that their memory is worse than it actually is.\nOlder adults' negative beliefs about their own memories are also more influenced by their slower processing speed than by their actual performance on memory tests. Slower processing speed means it takes longer to do something. The slower you process information, the more likely you are to have a negative belief about your memory.\nOlder adults' negative beliefs about their own memories are not as much influenced by who they are speaking with as by negative stereotypes about older memory.

In this process, information is first encoded, or stored, in a form that the brain can understand. Then, the stored information is retrieved, or retrieved from storage, and used as needed.\nThere are several types of memory. Each type is important for different aspects of learning and for different types of information.\nSensory memory: In sensory memory, information is stored for a brief period of time. Sensory memory includes both iconic memory (the image of an object that is seen in the corner of the eye) and echoic memory (the sound of a word that is still heard moments after it is spoken).\nIconic memory: The brief storage of visual information in the sensory memory is called iconic memory. The iconic memory may consist of fleeting images that are not perceived as part of the main stream of sensory input.\nEchoic memory: The brief storage of auditory information in the sensory memory is called echoic memory. The echoic memory may consist of fleeting sounds that are not perceived as part of the main stream of sensory input.\nIconic and echoic memories are not available for recall. They are not stored long enough.\nShort-term memory: In short-term memory, information is stored for a few seconds. Short-term memory is involved in immediate recall. For example, a person may use short-term memory to remember a phone number that was just spoken.\nShort-term memory is not as limited as iconic or echoic memory. It can hold more information. But it can only hold the information for a few seconds.\nLong-term memory: In long-term memory, information is stored for at least a few minutes. Long-term memory is involved in recall of information that has been learned before. For example, a person may use long-term memory to remember a fact that was learned in school.\nLong-term memory is not as limited as short-term memory. It can hold more information. And it can hold the information for at least a few minutes.\nSemantic memory: Semantic memory is the store of general knowledge. Semantic memory allows us to understand the meaning of words and to know about the world.\nThe meaning of words is stored in semantic memory. In addition, facts about the world are stored in semantic memory. Facts about the world may include the shapes of objects, the properties of objects, and the uses of objects.\nProcedural memory: Procedural memory is the store of skills. Procedural memory allows you to do things. Procedural memory may include riding a bicycle or typing on a keyboard.\nSome skills are stored in declarative memory. Riding a bicycle is a skill that is stored in procedural memory.\nDeclarative memory is the store of facts. Facts about the world are stored in declarative memory.\nEpisodic memory: Episodic memory is the store of autobiographical information. Episodic memory includes information about things that have happened in your life.\nEpisodic memory tells you about things that have happened to you. A person may use episodic memory to remember a trip that he or she took.\nWorking memory: Working memory is the store of information that is currently being used. Working memory allows you to do more than one thing at a time.\nFor example, a person may use working memory to add a series of numbers. The person must keep the numbers in working memory while doing the addition.\nLong-term memory is not the same as working memory.\nLong-term memory is the store of information that has been learned before. Long-term memory can hold a lot of information.\nWorking memory is the store of information that is currently being used. Working memory can only hold a limited amount of information."}

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme that removes free radicals by converting them into molecules that cannot cause damage.\nAnother key defense mechanism involves preventing free radicals from causing damage in the first place. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that can prevent free radicals from causing damage to cells.\nA third key defense mechanism involves repairing cells that have been damaged by free radicals. Telomerase is an enzyme that can repair damaged cells by lengthening the telomeres, which are the tiny ends of chromosomes.\nAntioxidant defense enzymes such as SOD and vitamins such as C play a important role in defending the body against free radicals."}

For example, people who have close relationships with older adults are likely to have more positive views. So, older adults who have grandchildren or other younger relatives are usually viewed more positively than those who do not.\nOther factors can also play a role. For example, people who are older themselves are usually more positive about aging than those who are younger. And in cultures where older adults are respected, people are likely to have more positive views of aging.\nSOLUTION: Other older adults are likely to have the more positive view of aging and older adults. Other older adults have lived through many of the same experiences and are likely to have a deep understanding of what it means to grow older.\nChildren younger than 10 are likely to have a view of aging that is more negative than positive. They may think that older adults are weak or sick.\nAdolescents and young adults are more likely to view aging negatively than older adults. They may see aging as something to be feared or avoided."}
