The incidence rate can be determined by the number of new cases of the disease that occur during a certain time period, such as a year, divided by the total number of people in the population.\nThe prevalence of a disease in a population is a measure of what proportion of the population has the disease. The prevalence can be determined by the number of people in the population who have the disease divided by the total number of people in the population.\nA disease can be more prevalent in a population when the incidence rate is higher. A higher incidence rate means that more people are developing the disease each year.\nBut a higher incidence rate does not necessarily mean that the prevalence of the disease in the population will increase. A higher incidence rate can increase the prevalence of the disease in the population if more people are surviving with the disease. For example, if more people are living with a disease, the prevalence of the disease in the population will increase.\nA lower incidence rate can decrease the prevalence of the disease in the population if the disease is becoming less common. For example, if the disease is becoming less common, the incidence rate will fall, and the prevalence of the disease in the population will decrease.\nSOLUTION: Faster recovery of the disease would increase the prevalence of the disease in the population. A higher incidence rate of the disease would not necessarily increase the prevalence of the disease in the population. If survival time with the disease increases, the prevalence of the disease in the population will increase."}

As a result, cholesterol in the diet was believed to be an important cause of human atherosclerosis. However, evidence to support this relationship is inconclusive.\nOne reason for the inconclusive evidence is the complexity of the mechanisms regulating the absorption of cholesterol and its export in lipoproteins. These mechanisms include the activity of several enzymes, such as cholesterol monooxygenase, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, and scavenger receptors.\nAnother reason is the complexity of the mechanism controlling the clearance of intestinally derived lipoproteins by the liver. For example, the liver can take up intestinally derived lipoproteins through the receptors very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. These receptors are subject to regulation by several different factors, including insulin.\nThe multiple intrahepatic responses to increased cellular cholesterol also contribute to the inconclusive evidence. Increased cellular cholesterol levels can lead to increased cholesterol biosynthesis, decreased cholesterol transport to the liver, and increased cholesterol release from hepatocytes."}

Each enzyme is specific to a reaction that occurs in cells. Enzymes do not actually participate in the reactions they catalyse. Instead, they bind to the other proteins in the reaction and cause them to link together. This binding helps to speed up the reaction.\nThe enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) helps break down alcohol. After a drink is consumed, ADH begins to break down the alcohol in the drink. ADH continues to break down the alcohol until there is no more alcohol left.\nWhen alcohol is broken down by ADH, it forms acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a toxic substance. It can cause symptoms such as flushing, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate.\nCatalase is an enzyme that helps break down alcohol. When alcohol is broken down by catalase, it forms acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a toxic substance. It can cause symptoms such as flushing, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate.\nAnother enzyme, cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), can also help break down alcohol. When alcohol is broken down by CYP2E1, it forms acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a toxic substance. It can cause symptoms such as flushing, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate."}

In some people, lactase production decreases to the point that they cannot digest lactose.\nLactase non-persisters are adults who have lost the ability to produce lactase.\nLactase persisters are adults who continue to produce lactase.\nAfrican, Asian, and Hispanic people are more likely to be lactase non-persisters than Caucasian people.\nSOLUTION: Intestinal lactase deficiency leads to lactose maldigestion, which can lead to lactose intolerance.\nThe question indicates that adults can be classified as lactase-persisters or lactase non-persisters.\nThere are four possible answers to the question.\n70%-75% is higher than the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide.\n45%-50% is higher than the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide.\n30%-35% is lower than the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide.\n10%-15% is lower than the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide."}
{"question": "Which of the following vitamins provides the coenzyme for carboxylation reactions?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Biotin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Niacin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Riboflavin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Thiamin"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: An organism's metabolism is the set of chemical reactions that occur within it. These reactions are essential for survival and are responsible for breaking down the organism's food, distributing nutrients throughout its body, and converting nutrients into the energy that powers its activities.\nVitamins are necessary for the proper functioning of an organism's metabolism. Because vitamins are not broken down and excreted like other substances, their levels in the body can become depleted. This depletion can interfere with metabolic reactions.\nEach vitamin is important for different aspects of metabolism. For example, water-soluble vitamins (vitamin C, vitamin B, and vitamin A) are important for chemical reactions that take place in water. Fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin A, and vitamin K) are important for chemical reactions that take place in fats.\nThe central role of each vitamin in its respective metabolic reaction is indicated by its function as a coenzyme. A coenzyme is a non-protein chemical that helps enzymes do their jobs. An enzyme is a protein that speeds up a chemical reaction. Because vitamins are not protein, they cannot be enzymes. Instead, vitamins participate in chemical reactions as coenzymes.\nSOLUTION: Riboflavin is a vitamin that acts as a coenzyme for carboxylation reactions. Carboxylation reactions make an organic molecule into a different type of molecule."}

The walls of the digestive organs are lined with cells that produce digestive enzymes. These cells release the enzymes into the digestive organs, where they break down food into small particles of nutrients. The small particles of nutrients are then absorbed into the blood.\nThe digestive enzymes work efficiently. Only a small amount of each enzyme is needed to begin the breakdown process. For example, the stomach produces only about 2,000 gastric enzymes per second, but that's all it takes to break down all the food particles in the stomach.\nThe products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides. The small intestine absorbs free amino acids and peptides. The blood carries these nutrients to the liver, where they are prepared for use by the body.\nThe liver plays an important role in protein digestion. It produces bile, which breaks down protein particles into small peptides that can be absorbed by the small intestine. The liver also produces enzymes that help break down proteins, peptides, and other nutrients.\nSOLUTION: C. Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion.\nGastric zymogenic cells produce enzymes that break down protein molecules. These enzymes are secreted into the stomach and help break down the protein particles in the stomach. This initiates the process of protein digestion.\nThe products of gastric protein digestion are then absorbed by the small intestine. The small intestine is lined with absorptive cells that can absorb the nutrients from the small particles of protein.\nThe other choices are incorrect.\nB. Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum.\nThe antrum is the lower part of the stomach. It grinds the food into small particles. But it does not ensure that all proteins are digested equally. Some protein molecules may not be broken down by the enzymes in the antrum.\nA. The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides.\nThis is correct. The small intestine absorbs free amino acids and peptides.\nD. The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters.\nThis choice is incorrect. The products of protein digestion can be absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters."}

Bones are made up of two parts: the bone mineral density, or BMD, and the bone structure.\nBone structure includes bone size and bone thickness. BMD is a measure of the amount of bone in the body. BMD is usually lower in women than in men.\nPoor muscle strength increases the risk of osteoporotic fracture. When muscles are weak, they can no longer provide a protective force around the bones. This puts the bones at greater risk of breaking.\nHigh bone mineral density does not necessarily mean that the bones are strong. High bone mineral density can occur in people with osteoporosis. These people have a high bone mineral density, but their bones are weak and can easily break.\nHigh body weight does not directly increase bone strength. However, a high body weight may help protect against osteoporotic fractures.\nHigh lean mass may increase bone strength. Lean mass is made up of muscle, bone, and other tissue.\nSOLUTION: Poor muscle strength increases the risk of osteoporotic fracture.

The digestive system breaks down and absorbs the food you eat.\nThe small intestine is a long tube that absorbs most of the nutrients from the food. The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes from the food. The remaining waste is removed from the body.\nSOLUTION: The answer is A.\nWhen the small intestine is not working properly, nutrients are not absorbed properly. Intestinal hormones, such as PYY, help you feel full. They are released by the intestine in response to food entering the small intestine. If PYY does not cause you to feel full, you may eat more.\nGut/brain signalling involves hormones and nerves. This pathway helps you sense how much you have eaten. The brain uses this information to help you stop eating.\nGreed and gluttony mean you eat too much. But they do not explain why the intestine is not working properly.\nFlavour signals can override satiety signals. But the problem is not with the intestine. It is with the food being too tasty."}

These studies can be used to investigate how early experience may affect later health.\nSome epidemiological studies have found that children who have had early life stressors, such as poor nutrition, have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes as adults. These studies have concluded that early life may be important in understanding the development of these diseases.\nOther epidemiological studies have suggested that the observed links between early experience and later health can be largely explained by adult lifestyle. For example, adults who have a healthy diet and exercise regularly may be at a lower risk of developing these diseases, regardless of their early life experiences.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nThe epidemiological evidence shows that programmed differences in physiology are linked to events before birth and in early postnatal life. These programmed differences may include changes in metabolism, heart function, and the immune system.\nThe observed links between early experience and later health have been seen in studies beyond the UK.\nAdult lifestyle does play a role in many diseases, but the observed links to risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes cannot be fully explained by adult lifestyle."}

Mechanisms can include cells, tissues, or organs.\nThe pathogenesis of a disease is how the disease happens. For example, the pathogenesis of diabetes includes the mechanisms by which high blood sugar levels harm the body.\nSOLUTION: Hyperglycemia is high blood sugar.\nType 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Insulin resistance occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. As a result, the body needs more insulin to move blood sugar into cells. But, insulin secretion decreases, so the blood sugar does not move into cells. This causes high blood sugar.\nThe liver releases glucose into the blood. The muscle and other tissues take up glucose from the blood.\nWhen insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion happen, the liver releases more glucose into the blood. But, the muscle and other tissues take up less glucose from the blood.\nSo, insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion can cause high blood sugar. But, they do not directly cause decreased glucose uptake from the skeletal muscle."}

The allele inherited from the mother has a different pattern of methylation, or DNA methyl groups, than the allele inherited from the father. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that can affect gene expression.\nMethylation of IGF2 is associated with a reduced risk of cancer. Fewer methyl groups at the IGF2 gene are associated with higher IGF2 mRNA and protein levels.\nSOLUTION: Folic acid supplementation is necessary for the formation of DNA during cell division. Because DNA methylation occurs after cell division, any dietary or supplemental source of folic acid can affect the methylation of IGF2.\nA woman's dietary intake of folic acid does not directly affect the methylation of IGF2 in her child. However, the child's diet after birth can affect the methylation of IGF2."}

Toxicity data measure the ability of a substance to cause harm. Toxicity data are often represented by one or more values, such as an LD50 value. The LD50 value is the dose of a substance that kills 50% of the members of a tested population.\nHuman exposure data are used to estimate the likelihood of a toxic effect in exposed humans. Human exposure data measure how much of the toxic substance people are exposed to.\nTo estimate the likelihood of a toxic effect on exposed humans, you need to calculate the probability that the dose of the toxic substance will exceed a specified threshold. This threshold is often called a benchmark dose, or BBD. The BBD is the dose of the toxic substance that is likely to cause a toxic effect in 50% of the people who are exposed to the substance.\nThe BBD can be calculated by comparing the BMD50 to the dose at which the toxicity was observed. The BMD50 is the dose of the toxic substance that is likely to cause a toxic effect in 50% of the people who are exposed to the substance. The BMD50 can be estimated from the toxicity data.\nTo support risk management decisions for food substances, the likelihood of a toxic effect on humans must be estimated. This estimate of probability is used in risk management decisions.\nTo derive Allowable Daily Intakes, the likelihood of a toxic effect on humans must be estimated. The Allowable Daily Intake is a value that is used to estimate the safe level of exposure to a toxic substance.

The main steps in glycogen metabolism are synthesis and breakdown.\nGlycogen synthesis occurs in the cells of the liver and muscles. The main step in glycogen synthesis is the conversion of glucose into glycogen by the enzyme glycogen synthase.\nGlycogen breakdown is controlled by the hormone insulin. In the fasting state, insulin levels fall, and glycogen breakdown increases. Free glucose is released from the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and muscles.\nThe release of glucose from the liver can cause insulin levels to rise. This feedback mechanism helps maintain levels of glucose in the body.\nSOLUTION: A key step in the synthesis of glycogen is the formation of UDP-glucose, which is made from NAD+, glucose, and a sugar bond.\nIn muscle in the fasting state, glycogen is broken down to glucose 6-phosphate, then free glucose.\nGlycogen is stored mainly in the liver and muscles.\nGlucagon increases the breakdown of glycogen."}

So, Olivia's opponent's action caused the utility company to spend money.\nHarrison Ford's delayed flight from New York to Los Angeles caused the actor to miss a public appearance. So, the actor missed the appearance as a result of the delayed flight.\nSOLUTION: Long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development was a direct cause of the food-price spike of 2007-2008. The lack of investment in agriculture made it difficult to increase food supplies in response to high food prices. As a result of the food-price spike, there was an increase in the use of food crops to produce biofuel. So, the use of food crops to produce biofuel was a consequence of the food-price spike.\nIt was caused by commodity price speculation. Speculators are investors who buy and sell goods in search of profit. Commodity price speculation involves buying and selling commodities in the hope of making a profit.\nThe food-price spike of 2007-2008 was caused by a combination of factors, including the increased demand for food crops to produce biofuel and the speculation in commodity markets."}

The dose of a food substance that is acceptable for human consumption is called the maximum allowable dose. The maximum allowable dose is set based on toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies.\nAnimal studies examine the effect of a food substance on animals. Toxicity and dose-response studies investigate how the dose of a substance affects the animal. These studies are conducted by giving the substance to animals at different doses. From these studies, the highest dose of the substance that causes no harm to the animals is identified.\nThe maximum allowable dose for a food substance is set based on the highest dose that causes no harm in animal studies. The maximum allowable dose is then compared to the daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food. If the daily intake is less than the maximum allowable dose, the substance is considered safe.\nSOLUTION: To evaluate the safety of a food substance, toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies, together with data on the concentration of the substance in food, are used. The concentration of a substance in food is an important factor in determining its safety.\nThe rate of consumption of the food to which the substance is added is not a factor in evaluating the safety of a food substance.\nThe daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food is a factor in evaluating the safety of a food substance.\nThe total amount of the substance a person will consume over a lifetime is a factor in evaluating the safety of a food substance."}

An organism's phenotype for a trait is written with both an uppercase and a lowercase letter. For example, the phenotype for the trait FLOWER COLOR is Flower color. The phenotype Flower color has two possible values: purple or white.\nAn organism's environment can also affect its phenotype for a trait. An organism's environment is represented by an environment symbol, which is written with an uppercase or lowercase letter. The symbol can appear before or after the phenotype. For example, the phenotype Flower color in the presence of light has the symbol Light after it.\nSOLUTION: A congenital disorder impairing the secretion of leptin would affect the phenotype for leptin, a hormone that helps regulate energy balance. A lecture: Alleles are different forms of a gene. For a gene to have an effect, it must be expressed as a protein or a RNA molecule. The amino acid sequence of a protein is affected by the alleles of the gene that code for it.\nFor example, the gene for the protein fructose bisphosphate aldolase has two possible alleles. These alleles are represented by the uppercase and lowercase letters B and b. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter.\nThe genotype for this gene is written as BB or Bb. These genotypes have different alleles for the gene.\nThe phenotype for this gene is written as B. This phenotype is a protein.\nThe allele B encodes a protein with an active enzyme. The allele b encodes a protein with an inactive enzyme.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene may have one of several possible alleles. An organism's phenotype for a trait may have two possible values.\nThese possible values are called allelic forms. An organism's allelic forms for a trait are its observable values for that trait.\nAn organism's observable values for a trait are called its phenotype for that trait."}

Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?\nThe number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.\nNow look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.\nThere are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.\nThere are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.\nSOLUTION: When using bioelectrical impedance for measuring body composition, an electrical current travels faster through muscle than it does through fat. This is because muscle contains more water than fat.\nMuscle weighs more than fat. But a person's body weight does not change much when they gain muscle and lose fat. So, it is hard to tell whether a person is gaining muscle or losing fat by looking at their body weight."}

{"question": "Although theoretically any food protein could act as a food allergen, there are eight major food allergens in Europe and North America which account for most of the allergic triggers observed in childhood. Which of the allergens pairings contains an allergen, which is not part of the group of eight major allergens?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cow's milk, egg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mustard seeds, lamb,"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Soy, peanuts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fish, shellfish"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Food allergies are a growing health concern. A food allergy occurs when the body has a negative reaction to a certain food. The body thinks the food is harmful, so it creates antibodies to fight it. These antibodies cause certain cells in the body to release chemicals. These chemicals can cause a range of symptoms, from hives and itching to digestive problems and respiratory problems.\nAllergies to foods can be dangerous. A severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, can be life-threatening. Anaphylaxis can cause difficulty breathing, a sharp drop in blood pressure, and even death.\nThere are eight major food allergens in Europe and North America. They are cow's milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, soy, fish, shellfish, and wheat. These food allergens are responsible for most of the allergic triggers observed in childhood.\nSOLUTION: Mustard seeds and lamb are not part of the group of eight major food allergens.\nSoy is part of the group of eight major food allergens. Peanuts are not.\nFish and shellfish are part of the group of eight major food allergens.\nCow's milk, egg, and wheat are part of the group of eight major food allergens."}
{"question": "Prenatal programming:\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Explains the rise in obesity in the pre-school years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "May be effected through the epigenetic effects of intrauterine nutritional inadequacy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Causes high blood pressure in young children"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only affects low birth weight children"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: During pregnancy, a mother's behaviors and the environment can affect her developing baby. These effects are called prenatal programming. They may affect the baby's birth weight and developments. Prenatal programming can also affect the baby's later risks for certain diseases.\nSome diseases are caused by problems with a gene. A gene is a piece of hereditary material that contains the instructions that affect inherited traits. A gene may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nAlterations to a gene may lead to different versions of a protein. The function of a protein depends on its sequence. So, alterations to a gene's alleles may affect the function of its protein.\nThese alterations do not need to affect the structure of the gene. So, the alterations are not inherited. Instead, they are caused by the environment.\nSome environments are not normal. Exposure to certain chemicals, for example, may affect the expression of genes in animals. And exposure to other chemicals may affect the expression of genes in plants.\nOther environments are normal. For example, a mother's behaviors and the environment in which a baby grows before birth may affect the baby's genes.\nThe words epigenetics and epigenesis are often used to describe these effects of the environment on genes.\nEpigenetics is the study of changes to gene function that do not involve changes to the gene's DNA sequence. These changes include alterations to gene expression and to the structure of chromosomes.\nEpigenesis is the study of how genes are affected by the environment. This includes the study of how a mother's behaviors and the environment in which a baby grows before birth may affect the baby's genes.\nSOLUTION: Prenatal programming may be effected through the epigenetic effects of intrauterine nutritional inadequacy. It has been found that a mother's diet during pregnancy may affect her baby's risk for certain diseases. This may be because of the epigenetic effects of intrauterine nutritional inadequacy.\nIntrauterine nutritional inadequacy is a lack of some nutrients in the food that a mother eats during pregnancy. This lack of nutrients may affect the epigenetic programming of the baby's genes.\nThe other answer choices are incorrect.\nPrenatal programming may affect high blood pressure in young children. This may happen because of the epigenetic effects of a mother's behaviors and the environment.\nPrenatal programming may affect only low birth weight children. Low birth weight is a risk factor for many diseases. So, prenatal programming may affect a child's risk for these diseases.\nPrenatal programming may explain the rise in obesity in the pre-school years. This may happen because of the epigenetic effects of a mother's behaviors and the environment."}

Even though these studies cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship, they are still informative. For example, observational studies can find an association between variables, but not the direction of the relationship.\nAn experimental study tries to establish a cause-and-effect relationship by varying the values of the variables and observing how they affect each other. Experimental studies can be designed with different types of control, or comparison groups, to address specific questions. For example, a randomized controlled trial compares outcomes for individuals who receive an intervention to outcomes for individuals who do not. A quasi-experimental design observes outcomes for individuals who receive an intervention and compares them to outcomes for individuals who did not but were similar in some way.\nSOLUTION: The different types of research findings provide different types of evidence for an association between diet and skeletal health.\nLong-term intervention studies that have a large sample size with fracture as an endpoint provide strong evidence for an association between diet and skeletal health. These studies show whether the intervention affects bone health, as measured by fractures. They have a large sample size, which makes them more generalizable.\nExperimental studies which measure bone remodelling through biochemical markers provide strong evidence for an association between diet and skeletal health. These studies directly measure the effects of diet on bone remodelling.\nExperimental studies which have a one-off measure of bone mineral density and bone mineral content provide some evidence for an association between diet and skeletal health. However, these studies do not provide strong evidence, because they measure bone density only one time.\nCase reports from individual patients provide some evidence for an association between diet and skeletal health. Each case report describes the experience of one patient. These reports can show how diet affects bone health in individual patients. However, case reports do not provide evidence about how diet affects the health of a larger group of people."}
