Investments can be risky, which means that they might not always work out as planned. But over the long term, investments can be a good way to make money.\nThe yield on an investment is the amount of money you make from an investment. Yields can be expressed as a percentage.\nAnnual yield = (Total amount of money earned in a year) / (Price of the investment)\nIf you buy an investment for $98,000 and you expect to earn $50 per day renting it out, you can estimate the annual yield on your investment as follows:\nAnnual yield = ($50/day) / ($98,000/365 days) = 0.45%\nThis means that if you work all year round, you can expect to earn 0.45% of your investment back each day."}

Assets are what a company owns, liabilities are what a company owes, and equity is the value of the company's assets that belong to its shareholders.\nA company's balance sheet has two sides: the left side reports the assets, and the right side reports the liabilities and equity. The left side always balances the right side. This means that the total assets equal the total liabilities and equity.\nIf a company records a purchase of merchandise on its credit, the purchase is an asset to the company. The asset is reported on the left side of the balance sheet. The cost of the merchandise is the right amount.\nIf a company does not record a credit purchase of merchandise, the purchase is not an asset to the company. The omission makes the assets less than the liabilities and equity. This means that the balance sheet is understated.\nSOLUTION: The omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise made prior to year end understated the assets. The merchandise was included in the year-end physical inventory, so the omission did not affect the liabilities or equity."}

For tax purposes which of the following statements is correct regarding Studio's status as a partnership?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Studio terminated as of January 1."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Studio terminated as of April 9."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Studio terminated as of December 31."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Studio did not terminate."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A partnership is a business entity that is formed when two or more people decide to share profits and losses. The partnership is not a separate entity from its partners. Instead, the partnership is created by the partners' agreement.\nFor tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) looks at the partnership agreement to determine if there has been a termination of the partnership. The IRS considers the following factors when determining if a partnership has terminated:\nthe agreement of the partners,\nthe death or withdrawal of a partner,\nthe sale of a partner's interest, and\nthe retirement of a partner.\nIf a partner withdraws from the partnership, the partnership is not terminated. The partnership can continue without the partner.\nIf a partner sells his or her interest in the partnership, the partnership is not terminated. The partnership can continue with the new partner.\nIf a partner retires from the partnership, the partnership is not terminated. The partnership can continue with the remaining partners.\nIf the partners agree to terminate the partnership, the partnership is terminated for tax purposes. The partnership's business must stop, and the partnership can notify the IRS that it has terminated.\nIf a partner dies, the partnership is terminated for tax purposes. The decedent's interests in the partnership can be passed to the decedent's estate or heirs.\nSOLUTION: Stone sold his interest to Taylor on April 9. So, April 9 is the termination date for Stone's interest in the partnership. It is not the termination date for the partnership. Studio did not terminate."}

This can help you determine the major differences between the approaches.\nFor example, if you are considering two different ways to organize a team, you might list the pros and cons of each approach as follows:\nApproach A:\nPros:\n* This approach allows team members to specialize in specific tasks.\n* This approach may be more efficient for small teams.\nCons:\n* This approach may not be as flexible as other methods.\n* This approach may lead to a lack of job satisfaction for team members.\nApproach B:\nPros:\n* This approach allows team members to learn more about other parts of the project.\n* This approach may be more enjoyable for team members.\nCons:\n* This approach may not be as efficient as other methods.\n* This approach may be more difficult to manage.\n\nSOLUTION: To determine the major differences between the just-in-time (JIT) and traditional approaches to manufacturing, list the pros and cons of each approach.\nTraditional approaches involve maintaining a large safety stock of raw materials and finished goods. This approach may lead to high inventory levels and excess waste.\nTraditional approaches also usually involve purchasing decisions by production employees. This approach may encourage employees to make purchases based on their immediate needs, rather than in terms of the company's long-term goals.\nThe JIT approach involves coordinating the production schedule with the arrival of materials and the needs of customers. This approach requires a high degree of coordination and communication.\nThe JIT approach usually involves a large number of suppliers while traditional approaches usually involve only a small number of suppliers. This difference affects the number of relationships a company must maintain.\nThe JIT approach uses a push-through system while traditional approaches use a pull-through system. This difference affects how information is shared and decisions are made."}
{"question": "On January 1, year 1, a company purchased equipment for $100 million. The equipment consists of four major components, of which two components comprise 80% of the total cost and each has a 20-year useful life. The remaining two components have costs of $10 million each; one of them has a useful life of four years, and the other has a useful life of five years. The company applies the cost model to the equipment and uses the straight-line method of depreciation. Under IFRS, what is the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "$4,000,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "$5,000,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "$8,000,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "$8,500,000"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Property, plant, and equipment are long-term assets that have a useful life of more than one year. Such assets are used in a company's day-to-day operations. They are not used up or worn out all at once. Instead, they are used for many years.\nProperties are sites and improvements to real estate. Plant refers to the machines and other assets that are used to produce a company's products or services. Equipment is a type of asset that is not as heavy as land or buildings. It is moved to a different location when it is no longer needed.\nAn asset's cost is spread over its useful life through a process called depreciation. Depreciation is an allocation of the cost of an asset to the periods in which the asset is expected to be used.\nThe straight-line method of depreciation spreads the cost of an asset evenly over its useful life. For example, if an asset has a useful life of five years, the straight-line method would allocate one-fifth of the cost of the asset to each of the five years.\nThe most common methods of depreciation are the straight-line method and the declining-balance method. The straight-line method is used more often than the declining-balance method.\nSOLUTION: The company uses the straight-line method of depreciation. Under this method, the depreciation expense for each year is the same. The depreciation expense is equal to the cost of the asset divided by its useful life.\nThe equipment's total cost is $100 million. The equipment has a useful life of 20 years. So, the depreciation expense is $5,000,000."}

The latter category is further divided into two subcategories: debt and equity.\nA subset of owners' equity is the available-for-sale section. This section represents the company's investments in securities, such as bonds and stocks. The equity category is used to report the value of these investments at fair market value.\nIf a company classifies a security as available for sale, it means that the security is not intended for trading and is not reported at its original cost. Instead, the security is reported at its fair market value. If the fair market value of the security increases, the company must record a gain. Conversely, if the fair market value of the security decreases, the company must record a loss.\nThe cash flow statement is a useful tool for financial analysis. It shows how the company's net income has changed over time. A increase in cash flow from operating activities indicates that the company's income increased. A decrease in cash flow from operating activities indicates that the company's income decreased.\nCash flow from investing activities shows how the company's investments in noncash assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and investments in securities, changed during the period. A increase in cash flow from investing activities indicates that the company purchased a large amount of noncash assets or securities. A decrease in cash flow from investing activities indicates that the company sold a large amount of noncash assets or securities.\nCash flow from financing activities shows how the company's financing changed during the period. A increase in cash flow from financing activities indicates that the company received more financing. A decrease in cash flow from financing activities indicates that the company paid off more financing.\nSOLUTION: Otra bonds are available-for-sale securities. The $200,000 purchase of Otra bonds is classified as an investing activity. Therefore, Verity should report $200,000 as net cash used in investing activities.\nThe U.S. Treasury bills are classified as cash equivalents.

If a tax return preparer fails to comply with the tax laws, they may be penalized.\nThe tax return preparer penalty applies to tax return preparers who prepare returns that are claimed to be incorrect because of a substantial understatement of tax. This penalty applies if the preparer knew or reasonably should have known that the return would be claimed as substantially understating the tax.\nThe penalty is $500 or more. If the IRS determines that the preparer's behavior was not a mistake but was instead willful, the penalty can be up to $1,000 or more.\nSOLUTION: In order for the tax return preparer penalty to not be applicable, it must be determined that there was a reasonable basis for the position. The other choices do not necessarily mean that there was a reasonable basis for the position.\nA reasonable basis for the position exists if the tax return preparer has reliably applied the tax law to the taxpayer's facts.

{"question": "Which of the following pricing policies results in establishment of a price to external customers higher than the competitive price for a given industry?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Collusive pricing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dual pricing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Predatory pricing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Transfer pricing"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Pricing policies are a company's strategy for setting prices for its products or services. Different pricing strategies can have significant effects on the company's profitability and competitiveness.\nSome pricing strategies are designed to set prices that are lower than the prices charged by competitors. These economy-wide pricing strategies can include predatory pricing, bait pricing, and penetration pricing.\nOther pricing strategies are designed to set prices that are higher than the prices charged by competitors. These non-economy-wide pricing strategies can include skimming pricing, peak pricing, and prestige pricing.\nTransfer pricing is a pricing strategy used by companies that sell products or services in multiple markets. These companies may charge different prices in different markets for the same product or service. Transfer pricing aims to reflect the costs of producing and selling the product or service, as well as the anticipated revenues.\nCollusive pricing is a type of non-economy-wide pricing. It occurs when competitors agree to charge the same prices.\nDual pricing is a type of non-economy-wide pricing. It occurs when different groups of customers are charged different prices for the same product or service.\nPredatory pricing is a type of non-economy-wide pricing. It occurs when a company lowers its prices to drive competitors out of business.\nSOLUTION: To establish a price to external customers higher than the competitive price for a given industry, a company must charge higher prices than its competitors. Dual pricing, which involves charging different groups of customers different prices, can establish a higher price to some customers. But the prices charged to other customers may be lower than the prices charged by competitors. So, dual pricing does not result in a price to external customers that is higher than the competitive price.\nCollusive pricing, predatory pricing, and transfer pricing all have the potential to result in a price to external customers that is higher than the competitive price. But they also have the potential to result in prices that are lower than the competitive price."}

If a stock has a high alpha, it is more risky than the market. If a stock has a low alpha, it is less risky than the market.\nA stock's beta is a measure of how much the stock's returns vary relative to the market. If a stock has a high beta, it will go up and down more than the market. If a stock has a low beta, it will go up and down less than the market.\nSOLUTION: The question is about the simple linear regression between stock and market returns. This means that the errors are fit to the stock returns to obtain a more precise estimate of the stock's beta. This gives a more precise estimate of the stock's risk relative to the market.\nThe alpha of stock returns is estimated by regressing stock returns against market returns. This means that the alpha of stock returns is estimated by regressing stock returns against the errors. This estimates the alpha of stock returns and their dependence on the market returns.\nThe model for the market returns is a function of the stock returns and their beta. This means that the model for the market returns is a function of the errors and the stock returns' beta. This gives a more precise estimate of the stock's risk relative to the market.\nThe minimised stock's alpha is the idiosyncratic component. This means that the minimised stock's alpha is the part of the stock's returns that is not dependent on the market returns. This gives a more precise estimate of the stock's risk relative to the market."}

Like a corporation, a partnership has assets, liabilities, and income. But unlike a corporation, a partnership is not a separate entity. Instead, the partnership is an association of partners.\nPartnerships can be classified as either ordinary or limited. An ordinary partnership is a business in which the partners actively participate. A limited partnership is a business in which some partners are active and some are not.\nA partnership's income is passed through to the partners.

When this happens, auditors need to update their risk assessment and, as a consequence, their audit plan.\nFor example, the auditor may need to increase the frequency or scope of testing for certain accounts, or perform additional procedures to address a new risk. As the auditor gathers additional information, the auditor may need to revise the audit plan and perform additional procedures.\nWhen the risk assessment changes, the auditor should consider whether the changes require a revision of the audit plan. The auditor should also consider whether the changes are material. Materiality is discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.\nSOLUTION: The auditor should increase the dollar threshold of vouching customer invoices.\nThe interim auditor's decision to use a different threshold for customer invoices could be a matter of materialness.

{"question": "Mast Co. converted from the FIFO method for inventory valuation to the LIFO method for financial statement and tax purposes. During a period of inflation would Mast's ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO be higher or lower than FIFO? Ending inventory Income tax payable", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lower Lower"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Higher Higher"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lower Higher"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Higher Lower"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Inventories are valued using either the FIFO (First In, First Out) method or the LIFO (Last In, First Out) method. With the FIFO method, the most recent purchases are valued at the highest cost and the oldest purchases are valued at the lowest cost. With the LIFO method, the most recent purchases are valued at the lowest cost and the oldest purchases are valued at the highest cost.\nThe effect of changes in inventory methods depends on whether the product's price has been increasing or decreasing.\nWhen inventory prices are increasing, a company may change from FIFO to LIFO or from LIFO to FIFO. The effect of this change is to decrease or increase income tax payable, respectively. This is because the change changes the ordering of the inventory costs. When inventory prices are increasing, the oldest costs are now the lowest costs, and the newest costs are now the highest costs. As a result of this change, the income tax payable based on the LIFO method is higher than the income tax payable based on the FIFO method.\nWhen inventory prices are decreasing, a company may change from FIFO to LIFO or from LIFO to FIFO. The effect of this change is to increase or decrease income tax payable, respectively. This is because the change changes the ordering of the inventory costs. When inventory prices are decreasing, the newest costs are now the lowest costs, and the oldest costs are now the highest costs. As a result of this change, the income tax payable based on the LIFO method is lower than the income tax payable based on the FIFO method.\nSOLUTION: Mast Co. converted from the FIFO method to the LIFO method. During a period of inflation, the LIFO method will create an ending inventory that is higher and income tax payable that is lower than the FIFO method would have created. The LIFO method will inflate the cost of the ending inventory relative to the FIFO method. This is because the LIFO method uses the most recent purchases at the lowest cost, while the FIFO method uses the most recent purchases at the highest cost. The difference between the two methods is the effect of the inflation on the cost of the inventory."}

The statute of limitations is generally 3 years from the later of the following two dates:\nThe due date of the return.\nThe date the return was filed.\nIf a return is filed after its due date, the 3-year period starts from the date the return was filed.\nSOLUTION: The examining agent may propose an adjustment to the year under examination. An agent may not propose adjustments to any year that is more than 3 years before or after the year under examination.\nFor example, if the year under examination is year 5, the agent may propose adjustments to years 1 through 5.

{"question": "Hall Co. purchased a machine on January 1 at a cost of $140000. The machine had an estimated useful life of eight years and a salvage value of $60000. Hall chose to depreciate the machine using the double- declining balance method.

The cost is the amount of money paid to buy the machine. The accumulated depreciation is the total amount of depreciation charged to the machine since it was purchased.\nDepreciation is a method of allocating the cost of a long-term asset to the years in which the asset is expected to be used. Assets with a finite useful life (like machines) are usually depreciated.\nThere are several methods of depreciation. The double-declining balance method is one of them. With this method, the depreciation for each year is based on both the machine's cost and its remaining useful life.\nThe carrying amount of a machine (or any other long-term asset) is its current value. It is determined by adding the cost to the accumulated depreciation.\nSOLUTION: The machine's useful life is eight years. The salvage value is $60,000. So, the machine's cost is $140,000.\nThe double-declining balance method is based on the machine's cost and its remaining useful life. Hall Co. has already depreciated the machine for one year. So, the machine's cost for the second year is $140,000 - $14,000 = $126,000.\nThe machine's remaining useful life is two years. So, the machine's depreciation for the second year is $126,000 x 2 = $252,000.\nThe carrying amount of the machine at the end of its second year is its cost plus its accumulated depreciation. So, the carrying amount is $126,000 + $252,000 = $378,000."}

Examples of non-financial assets include copyrights, patents, and trademarks. These assets are often very important to a company's business, but they do not show up on its balance sheet.\nThe life of a non-financial asset is known as its useful life. The useful life of a non-financial asset is used to calculate its amortization expense.\nAmortization expense is the cost of a non-financial asset that is spread out over its useful life. The amortization expense for a non-financial asset is calculated as the cost of the asset divided by its useful life.\nFor example, if a company pays $50,000 for a patent with a useful life of 20 years, the amortization expense for the patent will be $2,500 per year.\nSOLUTION: The legal life of the copyright is the life of the author plus 50 years. The copyright will not last for five years, so the copyright is not shown in the amortization table. The amortization table shows the useful life of the copyright.\nThe cost of the copyright is $20,000. The useful life of the copyright is the legal life of the copyright.

A higher rate of deviations increases the risk that controls are not additive.\nThe degree of assurance desired in the accounting records affects the tolerable rate of deviations. The higher the degree of assurance desired, the lower the tolerable rate of deviations.\nThe nature of the accounting records affects the tolerable rate of deviations. For example, the tolerable rate of deviations may be lower for records that are subject to change or that contain a high degree of estimation.\nThe results of previous tests of controls may affect the tolerable rate of deviations.

Deviations from pertinent controls can affect the risk that controls are not additive. An incorrect statement of the nature and extent of deviations from controls could lead to an inappropriate assessment of the risk of material misstatement.\nIncreasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations.\nThis answer is incorrect. The tolerable rate of deviations is specific to each test of controls and depends on the rate of deviations from pertinent controls and the degree of assurance desired in the accounting records.\nWhen the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high, the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk.\nThis answer is incorrect. The tolerable rate of deviations is specific to each test of controls and depends on the rate of deviations from pertinent controls and the degree of assurance desired in the accounting records.\nDeviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate.\nThis answer is incorrect.

These objectives often include efficient and effective operations, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations.\nAn auditor evaluates the effectiveness of an organization's internal controls by assessing how well the controls meet the organization's objectives. The auditor looks for evidence that the controls are performing as intended.\nIn order to do this, the auditor may review the organization's documentation of its controls, observe the operations of the organization, and test the effectiveness of the controls by performing specific procedures.\nSOLUTION: When an auditor is evaluating a client's internal controls, the most difficult issue for the auditor to detect is when someone erroneously disables edit checks in a software program designed to identify control exceptions.\nThis is the most difficult to detect because there are no additional transactions to be processed, no errors or anomalies to be flagged, and no suspicious activity to be uncovered.\nIn other words, the control is simply not working, and the auditor would not know that the control was disabled unless the auditor specifically tested for this condition."}

The trust uses after-tax money to make investments. The trust pays out income to the beneficiary, and the beneficiary pays taxes on the income.\nSimple trusts are required to report the income and expenses that are from trust assets. The trust's income includes investment income and any taxable capital gains. The trust's expenses include fees for the trustee and accountant.\nTo calculate the distributable net income, the trust must first calculate its net income. The trust's net income is its total income minus its total expenses.\nThe trust's total income is $2500 (dividend income) + $2000 (taxable interest income) + $5000 (capital gains).\nThe trust's total expenses are $500 (accounting fees) + $750 (trustee fees).\nThese expenses are allocable to income. This means that the expenses are paid from the income that the trust earns. So, the expenses reduce the trust's net income.\nThe trust's net income is $2500 + $2000 + $5000 - $500 - $750 = $9,500.\nBecause the trust's expenses are less than the trust's net income, the trust's distributable net income is also $9,500."}

These costs include acquisition costs, such as fees for investment bankers, attorneys, and accountants.\nThe acquiring company has several choices for how to treat these costs. It may choose to allocate them on a pro rata basis to the nonmonetary assets acquired. Or, it may choose to capitalize them as part of goodwill and test for impairment. The acquiring company may also choose to capitalize these costs as other assets and amortize them over a certain period. Or, it may choose to expense these costs as incurred in the current period.\nSOLUTION: The acquiring company should allocate the acquisition costs on a pro rata basis to the nonmonetary assets acquired. This means that the costs are assigned to the assets based on their relative values.\nFor example, let's say that the total acquisition costs are $100,000 and the value of the nonmonetary assets acquired is $800,000. To allocate the costs on a pro rata basis, the company would first calculate the pro rata value of the nonmonetary assets.\nPro rata value of nonmonetary assets = Total acquisition costs / Value of nonmonetary assets acquired\n= $100,000 / $800,000\n= $0.125 per pound\nThen, the company would multiply the pro rata value by the number of pounds of the nonmonetary assets acquired.\nAcquisition costs allocated to nonmonetary assets acquired = Pro rata value of nonmonetary assets x Number of pounds of nonmonetary assets acquired\n= $0.125 per pound x 10,000 pounds\n= $1,250\nThe acquiring company would also capitalize $1,250 as part of goodwill.

These costs are called bankruptcy costs.\nA company can also have different costs associated with equity and debt. For example, equity investors are riskier than debt investors, so equity investors require a higher return to invest in the company. This return is called an agency cost.\nThe tax savings a company realizes from being able to claim interest expenses on its taxable income is called a tax shield.\nThe value of a firm is the present value of all its future profits.

Including deposits in transit in monthly bank reconciliations may increase the risk of fraud. Deposits in transit do not affect the company's bank balance, so they can be easily overlooked.\nEquipment is usually sold at a loss before being fully depreciated. Selling equipment at a loss before it is fully depreciated may indicate that the company is trying to hide the effects of fraud.\nSOLUTION: Situations that may increase the risk of fraud include a significant disregard for regulatory authorities, a lack of turnover of employees in the accounting department, and a high-pressure business environment.\nEquipment is usually sold at a loss before being fully depreciated may indicate that the company is trying to hide the effects of fraud. However, this situation does not directly relate to the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting.\nMonthly bank reconciliations usually include several deposits in transit.

The accounts receivable balance is the total amount of money owed to the company by its customers.\nThe accounts receivable balance is impacted by both cash sales and credit sales.\nCredit sales increase the accounts receivable balance. When a customer buys goods or services on credit, the account receivable increases by the amount of the sale.\nCash sales reduce the accounts receivable balance. When a customer pays a credit sale in cash, the account receivable balance decreases by the amount of the sale.\nThe ending accounts receivable balance is affected by the company's credit policy and its customers' payment habits. A company with a lenient credit policy and customers with consistent payment habits will have a higher ending accounts receivable balance than a company with a strict credit policy and customers with consistent payment habits.\nSOLUTION: The ending accounts receivable balance is equal to the beginning accounts receivable balance plus the net change in accounts receivable.\nThe beginning accounts receivable balance is $25 million. The net change in accounts receivable is $265 million - $25 million = $240 million.\nSo, the ending accounts receivable balance is $240 million."}

When a company makes a capital expenditure, it spends money on a capital asset.\nThe purpose of a capital budget is to make sure that the company spends money only on investments that will make the company more money than they cost. This is done by comparing the expected cost of an investment to the expected benefits of the investment.\nIf the expected benefits of an investment are greater than the expected cost, the investment is called a positive NPV (Net Present Value) investment. A company should make a positive NPV investment.\nIf the expected cost of an investment is greater than the expected benefits, the investment is called a negative NPV investment.

Depreciation is included in the operating expenses of an asset.\nThe payback period is the amount of time it takes for the accumulated cash inflows from an asset to equal its cost. A shorter payback period is generally better.\nSOLUTION: The expected payback period for the new machine is 5.2 years.
