The workplace should not make employees sick or cause them harm. Employers have a responsibility to provide a safe and healthy work environment.\nAnother ethical concern of employees is the right to privacy. Employers have a responsibility to respect employees' privacy. This includes not unreasonably invading employees' privacy, not unreasonably sharing employees' personal information, and not unreasonably collecting unnecessary personal information.\nThe right to free speech is not a right to free speech at work. The First Amendment does not protect employees who speak out about workplace issues. However, employees can express their political views outside of work.\nThe right to work-life balance is not a federally protected right. Some employers have implemented work-life balance programs, but they are not required to do so."}

The organizational objective is the end toward which the organization's resources are directed.\nTo make a profit: A business must create value for customers as a way of securing revenue. The business must then manage its resources in a way that allows it to make a profit by subtracting the cost of creating that value from the revenue.\nProcure resources: The term procurement refers to the process a business uses to acquire the resources it needs to accomplish its objective. So, the primary objective of a business organization is not to procure resources. Rather, the organization must procure resources in order to accomplish its objective.\nCommunicate with shareholders: Communicating with shareholders is a critical part of a business organization's governance. However, communicating with shareholders is not the organization's objective. Instead, the organization must communicate with shareholders in order to obtain resources or to find customers.\nMediate between the organization and the environment: The environment includes all of the stakeholders who are not part of the organization. These stakeholders, including customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers, are affected by the organization's objective. The organization's objective is to mediate between the organization and the environment."}

It suggests that an organization is financially responsible when it considers the interests of its stakeholders, who are not just shareholders, but also customers, employees, and the community.\nAn organization that follows the enlightened self-interest model of CSR considers the long-term effects of its actions. It chooses to do what is best for everyone involved. For example, an organization that chooses not to harm the environment is acting in its own best interest. If the environment is harmed, the organization's customers, employees, and shareholders may be affected.\nAn organization that is legally compliant is not necessarily acting in its own best interest. An organization can be legally compliant and socially irresponsible.

Some jobs are related to running the business. Other jobs are related to producing the goods or services that the business sells.\nThe terms gig and sharing describe ways businesses are using jobs differently.\nGig. A gig economy is an economy that is based on jobs that are called gigs. In a gig economy, people are hired for a specific task instead of on a long-term basis.\nSharing. A sharing economy is an economy that is based on people sharing things they already have. In a sharing economy, people often use their own cars, apartments, or skills to provide services.\nSOLUTION: The term gig economy is the term used to describe individuals being hired for a specific task instead of on a long-term basis.

Few people can agree on what is right or wrong, and even wider disagreements arise when the issue at hand involves more than one person or group. As a result, moral issues often lead to impasses, or in other words, disagreements that are hard to break.\nMoral intensity is a way of thinking about how strong people's feelings are about a moral issue. Some issues are more important to people than others, and the importance of an issue makes it more intense.\nSocial consensus, proximity, temporal immediacy, and cultural immediacy are all factors that can impact the moral intensity of an issue.\nSocial consensus refers to the degree of agreement among people about an issue. An issue is more intense when there is a greater consensus about it.\nProximity refers to the distance or nearness of an issue. An issue is more intense when it is closer to the person or group.\nTemporal immediacy refers to the degree to which an issue is before the person or group. An issue is more intense when it is more immediately relevant.\nCultural immediacy refers to the degree to which an issue is before the person or group in a more abstract sense. An issue is more intense when it is more directly relevant.\nThe first step in determining the moral intensity of an issue is to identify the factors that are impacting it.\nOnce you have identified the factors that are impacting the moral intensity of an issue, you can decide how intense the issue is.\nSOLUTION: Look at the underlined text in the question. The question asks about how social consensus, proximity, temporal immediacy, and social dissensus affect moral intensity.\nSocial dissensus refers to the degree of agreement among people about an issue. An issue is more intense when there is a greater dissensus about it.\nTemporal immediacy refers to the degree to which an issue is before the person or group. An issue is more intense when it is more immediately relevant.\nProximity refers to the distance or nearness of an issue. An issue is more intense when it is closer to the person or group.\nSocial consensus and social dissensus are opposites. An issue is more intense when there is a greater disagreement among people about it.\nProximity, temporal immediacy, and social dissensus are all factors that can impact the moral intensity of an issue."}

Unlike in a command economy, in a market economy, there are no central planners who dictate how resources will be used. Instead, consumers and firms communicate with one another through prices.\nWhen consumers are willing to pay more for a product, they signal to firms that they value that product more highly. In response, firms have an incentive to produce more of that product. This additional production also sends a signal to consumers that the product is more highly valued.\nWhen firms are able to charge higher prices for a product that is in short supply, they have an incentive to increase production. This increased production can make the product less in short supply. But if firms simply respond by charging lower prices, the quantity demanded will increase, and the product will again be in short supply.\nWhen firms are able to charge higher prices for a product, they have an incentive to figure out how to produce the product more efficiently. This efficiency can help keep prices higher.\nIf a firm produces a product that is harmful to the environment, the firm will be forced to pay the costs of that harm. In order to reduce these costs, the firm may choose to decrease its environmental impact by developing new technology or changing its production processes.\nSOLUTION: Better environmental performance can increase a firm's costs. For example, a firm may have to invest in new technology to reduce its environmental impact. Or, a firm may have to change its production processes, which can be expensive.\nBetter environmental performance can also decrease a firm's revenue. For example, a firm may have to pay the costs of pollution fines. Or, consumers may be willing to pay higher prices for products that are environmentally friendlier, but the firm may not be able to charge higher prices for its own products."}

These include the choice of means to the decision maker, varying from very direct modes to indirect modes, the intended audience, being either public or private, and the breadth or height of transmission.\nWhen a message is communicated directly to a decision maker, it is a direct mode of influence. The decision maker can also overhear or see the message, making it a more salient influence.\nIndirect modes of influence are less salient, but they can have a stronger effect on behavior. For example, a message that is intended for someone else but that is overheard by a decision maker can have a strong effect, because the decision maker is not aware that the message is intended specifically for him or her.\nThe intended audience can also affect the saliency of the message. A message that is intended for a large audience is less personal than a message that is intended for a single individual.\nThe breadth of transmission refers to the number of people who receive the message. A broad transmission reaches more people, which can increase its impact.\nThe height of transmission refers to the number of people who must be persuaded in order for the message to be effective. A message that must persuade many people in order to be effective is a taller transmission.\nThe content of the message also affects its power to influence. The more persuasive the message is, the more powerful its influence.\nSOLUTION: To influence government, a communication can take different avenues of approach, varying from very direct modes to indirect modes. For example, a communication can be a personal visit from a company executive to a government official, or it can be a letter to a government agency.\nThe breadth of transmission is not a factor for government, because government is a single entity.\nThe height of transmission is not a factor for government, because the communication is not intended to persuade a group of people.\nThe content of the message is the factor that most affects its power to influence. The communication should make a clear, persuasive case for what the company wants the government to do."}

This process can be caused by globalization, which is the interconnectedness of the world's economies, societies, and cultures. Some people think that cultural homogenization is a positive trend, while others think it is a negative trend.\nGlobalization has many causes, including advances in communication and transportation technology. For example, the Internet and international air travel have made it easier for people to communicate and share ideas with others around the world. These advances have also made it easier for goods and services to be produced and sold in other countries.\nOther causes of globalization include the growth of international trade and the movement of people across borders. As companies search for the cheapest labor and the largest markets, they often set up operations in different countries. When this happens, people in different countries can exchange ideas and culture.\nSOLUTION: To determine the differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources, look at the availability, environmental impact, cost, reliability, flexibility, and sustainability of each type of energy.\nRenewable energy sources are more available, have a lower environmental impact, are more expensive to initial set up, are more reliable, and are more flexible and sustainable than non-renewable sources.\nSo, renewable and non-renewable energy sources are different in terms of availability, environmental impact, cost, reliability, flexibility, and sustainability."}

In other words, they have assumed that how we ought to act is a matter of understanding what is in our own or others' interests. They have also assumed that it is in our interest to be moral.\nVirtue ethics, by contrast, locates morality beyond the sphere of rationality in an emotional \"moral impulse\" towards others. Unlike deontology, virtue ethics is not concerned with the rules or duties that establish what is right or wrong. Instead, virtue ethics is concerned with the character of the virtuous person. A virtuous person is someone who has a certain character, and virtue ethics is about how to develop that character.\nAccording to virtue ethics, we should cultivate our emotions and use our feelings to guide our actions. We should do this because our feelings can guide us to the right course of action. Doing the right thing can lead to positive feelings, such as pride and contentment, and avoiding the wrong thing can lead to negative feelings, such as guilt and shame.\nVirtue ethics is often contrasted with both deontology and consequentialism. Deontology assumes that moral rules are the basis of morality, and consequentialism assumes that right and wrong depend on the consequences of an action."}

Some of the key differences between Islamic finance and conventional finance include prohibition of charging and paying interest, speculative transactions, and uncertain transactions.\nInterest is not allowed in Islamic finance. Instead, money can be raised by selling assets or services at a profit. This approach is called profit-and-loss sharing.\nInvestment in speculative assets, such as gambling or casinos, is also prohibited in Islamic finance. Instead, Islamic financial institutions must invest in tangible assets or other assets that are considered to be socially constructive.\nIslamic financial institutions are also prohibited from engaging in uncertain transactions, such as insurance. Instead, Islamic financial institutions can provide alternative forms of risk management, such as Islamic reinsurance.\nConventional finance is not based on sharia. So, there are no restrictions on interest, speculative transactions, or uncertain transactions."}
