When you report the facts, be sure to explain what they mean.\nPercentages have two parts. The first part is the number or percentage of people who gave a certain answer. The second part is the group of people whose behavior is being reported.\nFor example, in the question, \"73% of Americans believe in ghosts,\" the first part of the percentage is the number of people who believe in ghosts. The second part of the percentage is Americans.\nSo, the statement that \"73% of Americans believe in ghosts\" means that 73 percent of the people who were surveyed said they believed in ghosts.\nWhen you are the writer, you need to explain what the statistics mean. Here are some ways to do that:\nUse a sentence or two to interpret the statistics.\nFor example, you can say, \"73% of Americans believe in ghosts, which suggests that many Americans are superstitious.\"\nAnnotate the statistics.\nFor example, you can write, \"73% of Americans believe in ghosts\" and then add an annotation to the side or below the statistics to explain their meaning.\nAnnotations can help you stay within the bounds of the essay. If you write out a long interpretation, it may be helpful to put that text inside an annotation.\nUse a graph or chart.\nConsider using a graph or chart to display the statistics.\nFor example, a bar graph can show the percentage of Americans who believe in ghosts.\nThese visual aids can help you stay within the bounds of the essay.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nAccording to the question, 73% of US adults say computer programs will always reflect human bias.

But as society has grown, the real cost of a good or service has become more important.\nThe real cost of a good or service is its cost in terms of the goods and services it takes to produce it. For example, the real cost of producing cars is the cost of the steel, rubber, and fuel that goes into making the cars.\nThe nominal cost of a good or service is its price in terms of money. For example, the nominal cost of producing cars is the sum of the prices of the steel, rubber, and fuel that go into making the cars.\nIf the price of a good or service in terms of money changes, the real cost of producing it changes. But if the price of a good or service in terms of money stays the same, the real cost of producing it stays the same.\nSOLUTION: The real cost of a good or service is its cost in terms of the goods and services it takes to produce it. If the price of a good or service in terms of money changes, the real cost of producing it changes.\nIn 2017, the price of a good or service in terms of money changed. So, the real cost of a good or service changed.\nThe question tells you that, as of 2017, the share of GDP spent on the military by China is about 2%. This means that, in terms of money, the cost of the military in China is 2% of the total amount of goods and services in China.\nSo, in terms of the goods and services it takes to produce the military, the real cost of the military in China is about 2%."}

But today, most Americans vote for a political party.\nA political party is a group of people who share similar ideas and work together to achieve common goals. In the United States, there are two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.\nMost political parties have a platform that includes their ideas for how the country should run.

These candidates are called nominees.\nAfter a president is elected, he or she does not belong to a political party. Instead, the president represents all Americans.\nSOLUTION: In the United States, most presidents are elected to a four-year term. A president can be reelected for a second term, but there is no limit on how many times a president can be reelected.\nBefore being reelected for a third term as president, many Americans approved of running for a third time.

A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the cells of an organism. Viruses cannot reproduce on their own.\nA virus invades a cell by entering through the cell membrane. The virus uses the cell's own machinery to replicate itself. The replicated viruses then exit the cell through the cell membrane, moving on to infect other cells.\nThe infected cells can be damaged or killed by the virus. Some viruses cause chronic infections, which can continue for years. Other viruses cause acute infections, which can be severe but may be cured in a few days.\nSOLUTION: The global HIV/AIDS death rate is highest for the age group 15-49. This group includes people who were born between 1961 and 1985.\nMost of the people in this age group were born before the AIDS epidemic began. Before the AIDS epidemic, people did not have a reliable method to protect themselves from HIV. So, many people born between 1961 and 1985 were infected with HIV as children.\nNow that they are adults, these people make up a large number of HIV/AIDS cases. HIV/AIDS is more deadly for this age group than for any other."}
