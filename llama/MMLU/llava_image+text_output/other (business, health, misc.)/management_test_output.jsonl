Competition can be different depending on the industry.\nThe five forces model suggests that competition is made up of five types of competitive activity.\nThe potential for entry into the industry: This type of competition is the possibility that new companies will enter the industry. If many new companies enter the industry, the price of entering the industry will go up, and the profits of existing companies will go down.\nThe threat of substitute products: This type of competition is the possibility that new products will be invented that can be used instead of your product. If many new substitutes are invented, the demand for your product will go down, and the profitability of your business will go down.\nThe power of customers: This type of competition is the ability of customers to switch to another product. If customers can easily switch to another product, they will have more power to bargain with you for lower prices.\nThe level of rivalry: This type of competition is the intensity of the rivalry between existing companies in the industry. Companies in an industry with high rivalry compete hard to gain customers. Companies in an industry with low rivalry don't compete as hard.\nThe threat of supplier power: This type of competition is the ability of suppliers to raise prices. If suppliers have a lot of power, they can raise prices and make it harder for businesses to make a profit.\nSOLUTION: In the industry, the potential for entry into the industry is the type of competitive activity that exists between organizations. The sign of this type of competition is that it is hard for new companies to enter the industry."}

NPM is not a specific policy or law. Instead, it is a approach to public management that emphasizes certain ideas and values.\nOne of the guiding principles behind NPM is introducing private sector business principles into the public sector. This means using business techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector.\nAnother principle is profit maximization. In a business, the goal is to make as much money as possible. In the public sector, the goal is to provide goods and services to citizens. NPM does not aim to make the public sector more profitable. Instead, it aims to make the public sector more efficient and effective.\nNPM does not mean replacing public management with private sector management. The public sector is accountable to the public, and its goals are not the same as those of the private sector.\nNPM does mean restructuring public organizations. In the past, public organizations were often organized in a bureaucratic manner. Today, they are often restructured to be more businesslike.

There are many types of structures, but functional structures are organized around specific functions or departments.\nA functional structure is created when employees are organized by function. Each department performs a specific set of tasks. For example, the marketing department might be responsible for advertising, market research, and sales.\nThe marketing department might be organized as a team, with employees responsible for each function. For example, the team might include an advertising specialist, a market researcher, and a sales manager.\nA multi-skilled employee is a person who has skills in more than one area. A functional structure makes it possible for employees to develop a range of skills.\nA project team is a group of people who come together to complete a specific task. A project team is not a structure. But within a functional structure, employees can be assigned to project teams.\nFor example, a marketing manager might lead a project team to develop a new advertising campaign. The team might include a market researcher, an advertising specialist, and a sales manager.\nSOLUTION: Functional structures help to create specialisation.\nWith a functional structure, each department can become an expert in its own function. For example, the marketing department might become experts in market research, advertising, and sales."}

This means that decisions and actions are to be chosen in order to bring about the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people.\nThe principle of equality for everyone holds that every person is equally deserving of respect and consideration. This means that the interests of different people are to be weighed equally, and that no one is to be favored over others simply by virtue of their identity.\nThe best outcome for the majority of people means that the goal of a decision or action is to choose the outcome that will make the majority of people happiest.\nThe least worst outcome for everybody means that the goal of a decision or action is to choose the outcome that will make everybody happiest.\nSOLUTION: Utilitarianism is not defined by the principle of equality for everyone. In fact, utilitarianism is more concerned with overall happiness than with equality.\nUtilitarianism is not defined by the principle of the best outcome for the majority of people, either. This is because utilitarianism also considers the interests of individual people, and not just the majority.\nUtilitarianism is defined by the principle of the least worst outcome for everybody. This means that the goal of a decision or action is to choose the outcome that will make everybody happiest."}

It is the glue that holds the organization together. Organizational culture can be analyzed by looking at three parts: the basic cultural assumptions, the enacted cultural elements, and the organization's artifacts.\nBasic cultural assumptions are the beliefs and values that are shared by the members of an organization. These beliefs and values are so commonly held that they are rarely questioned. They can include things like the organization's core values, its assumptions about how work gets done, and its beliefs about what is important.\nEnacted cultural elements are the specific behaviors and practices that are part of an organization's culture. These elements are often the result of the basic cultural assumptions. They can include things like how people are recognized and rewarded, what kinds of language is used in meetings, and what kinds of channels of communication are used.\nOrganization's artifacts are the symbols, language, and other things that make up the work environment. They include things like the organization's logo, its dress code, and the layout of its offices.\nSOLUTION: A power culture is most likely to deliver stability and efficiency. In a power culture, the organization is structured around formal authority, and decision-making is centralized. This structure can help to create stability and efficiency because it is clear who is in charge of what, and decision-making is focused at the top of the organization.\nA task culture is likely to be created by a group of people who work well together and who share a common goal. They may have a strong commitment to the organization and a willingness to work long hours. However, a task culture may not be as efficient or stable as a power culture because the focus is on getting the work done, rather than on following formal rules and procedures.\nA people culture is likely to be created by a group of people who care about each other and who want to help one another. However, a people culture may not be as efficient or stable as a power culture because the focus is on helping each other, rather than on following formal rules and procedures.\nA role culture is likely to be created by a group of people who are concerned with doing their jobs correctly. They may have a strong commitment to the organization and a willingness to work long hours. However, a role culture may not be as efficient or stable as a power culture because the focus is on doing the job, rather than on following formal rules and procedures."}

It shows the different levels of management and the relationships between them.\nAn organization's hierarchical structure can affect how quickly it can respond to change.\nA small span of control, or number of employees per manager, can help an organization be more flexible and respond to change quickly.\nA large span of control can help keep costs down by reducing the number of managers an organization needs.\nA clear chain of command can help reduce confusion and ensure that people know who to report to.\nA hierarchical structure can help maintain discipline and control by following standard procedures.\nSOLUTION: A clear chain of command is not an advantage of a hierarchical structure. On the contrary, a clear chain of command is a necessary aspect of a hierarchical structure.\nA clear chain of command means that everyone knows what is expected of them and who they report to. This can help reduce confusion and ensure that people know who to report to.\nA small span of control can help an organization be more flexible and respond to change quickly.\nA large span of control can help keep costs down by reducing the number of managers an organization needs.\nA hierarchical structure can help maintain discipline and control by following standard procedures.\nThese are the advantages of a hierarchical structure."}

Some group norms tell group members how they should act during meetings. Other group norms describe the values and beliefs that group members share.\nGroup norms can help group members to know how they are expected to behave. They can also help group members to know how to behave if they are in a difficult situation. For example, a group norm may state that every member has an equal right to speak during a meeting. If a group member is not speaking during a meeting, the other group members may remind the person of the group norm.\nGroup norms can be different for each group. Even similar groups can have different norms. For example, a group of students may have a norm of speaking only when called upon. But a group of friends may have a norm of speaking out loud when they have something to say.\nSOLUTION: Group norms are modes of behavior that are acceptable to and shared by group members. Group norms can describe the values and beliefs that group members share. But group norms do not have to be shared by all group members.\nGroup norms do not have to be different from the values and beliefs of other group members.

The ranks of bureaucrats are organized in a strict hierarchy, with each position having a specific duty. This structure helps bureaucracies achieve their goals efficiently. But the structure can also create conflicts and problems.\nPeter Drucker argues that the key challenge to effective bureaucratic management is the task of seeing to it that the institutional structure supports the purpose of the organization. In other words, a bureaucracy's goals should determine its structure.\nThose who benefit from the status quo will resist any change that might disrupt the organization's traditional structure. But as Charles O. Jones and Michael L. Tushman argue, when an industry's structure is changed, new patterns of competition and new winners and losers often emerge.\nDuring the 1930s, the American federal government increased its use of bureaucracies. By the end of the 20th century, the number and size of bureaucracies had proliferated. In general, bureaucracies are created to meet the needs of capitalism. But the needs of capitalism are not stationary. As a society, we need to decide whether bureaucracies are the best way to meet the changing needs of capitalism.\nSOLUTION: Weber was concerned with the reaction of workers to key characteristics of bureaucracies. Weber tried to understand the consequences of bureaucratization on workers.\nMerton, Gouldner, and Mayo also examined bureaucracies. But their focus was different from Weber's.\nMerton was concerned with the reaction of workers to key characteristics of bureaucracies.\nGouldner was concerned with the way bureaucracies channel individual motivations.\nMayo was concerned with the way bureaucracies shape the attitudes of their employees."}

The chain of command usually extends from the top of an organization down to the bottom.\nWhen you follow a chain of command, you pass your requests up the line of command. The requests are evaluated by each person in the chain of command. If a person in the chain of command can help you, he or she will. If not, he or she will pass your request up to the next person in the chain of command.\nThere are usually fewer people above you in the chain of command than below you. This is because there are usually more people below you in the chain of command than above you. This design helps ensure that requests can be evaluated by the person who is best able to handle them.\nSOLUTION: A chain of command extends from the top of an organization down to the bottom."}

How people behave in organizations is very important to the survival and success of the organization. To understand how people behave, sociologists have developed a number of theories.\nExpectancy theory is built around the principle that people make choices regarding how to behave based on values and beliefs. This means that people will behave in a certain way if they believe that a certain behavior will lead to a desired outcome. This theory suggests that organizations need to make sure that the behaviors they want are rewarded.\nInstrumental theory is built around the principle that people make choices regarding how to behave based on their assessments of the situation and their values and beliefs. This means that people will behave in a certain way if they believe that a certain behavior will help them achieve their goals. This theory suggests that organizations need to make sure that employees understand the organization's goals and how their behaviors contribute to those goals.\nClassical theory is built around the principle that people make choices regarding how to behave based on their values and beliefs. This means that people will behave in a certain way if they believe that a certain behavior is expected or required. This theory suggests that organizations need to make sure that employees understand the organization's values and expectations.\nContingency theory is built around the principle that the best way to understand how people will behave is to consider the specific situation. This theory suggests that there is no one best way to organize people or manage them. Instead, the best way to manage people is to consider the specific situation and the values and goals of the organization."}
