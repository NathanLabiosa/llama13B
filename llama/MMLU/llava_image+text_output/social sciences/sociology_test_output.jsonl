Twitchell have argued that the media target the masses as consumers. The media are central to the mass-society theory, as they are the chief organs of the culture of the society.\nThe theory suggests that the content of the media is determined by market forces, which are driven by advertisers and audiences. Advertisers want to reach as many people as possible, so they insist on media that offer the largest audiences. Audiences, for their part, are interested in media that offer entertainment and information, which they can get more easily and at less cost from some media than from others. The market, in other words, tends to direct the media to offer content that will appeal to the largest number of people.\nHowever, the theory does not necessarily suggest that the mass audience is passive or that it accepts all the values of the ruling class. Instead, the theory suggests that the mass audience is active and that it makes selective interpretations of media messages."}

This approach to urban sociology emphasizes the ways in which social and physical environments interact to shape social life.\nOne of the key ideas in the ecological approach to urban sociology is that people's interactions with the physical environment are not just a part of their social interactions, but are part of their daily ecology. The term ecology refers to the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their physical environment.\nEcological urban sociologists study the ways in which people interact with the physical environment to get food, drink, and other things they need. They also study how people get rid of the things they do not need.\nSocial interactionists ignore the physical environment, treating it as if it does not exist. Economists study how people make decisions, but they do not pay attention to the physical environment. Ecological urban sociologists consider the choices that are made available to people by the physical environment.\nSOLUTION: The ecological approach to urban sociology involves studying how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources, the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city, the way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues, and how men and women used the city's public spaces differently."}

This process is not always successful. People may fail to learn ways of behaving that are expected by their society. In this case, society may consider these people deviant.\nBecker argues that cannabis use is learned. He also argues that cannabis use is deviant. So, cannabis use is learned throughout the socialization process by which people become deviant."}

Institutions are the norms, roles, and social positions that make up society. Institutions are crucial to the social system because they determine the rules and expectations that govern behavior. Institutions are also related to other social institutions. As you read about each institution, keep in mind that social institutions are highly specialized, interrelated sets of social practices.\nThe family is the first institution that people are socialized into. It is an intergenerational system that includes parents and children. Family institutions include not only the parents and children but also any other family members, such as grandparents, aunts, and uncles.\nThe role of the family is to socialize and reproduce individuals. Family institutions are also thought to instill in people the values and norms that are necessary for the survival of society.\nThe school is an important institution for the socialization of children. Schools teach children the values and knowledge that are needed to be productive members of society.\nWork is an institution that involves structured activities that produce goods and services. The work institution is part of the economy, which also includes institutions such as markets and money.\nThe economy is part of the social system. As such, it have an impact on other social institutions. For example, the work institution helps determine family roles and shapes the values of society.\nThe table below shows some ways in which institutions are related to each other.\nInstitution Institution Relationships\nfamily economic\neconomy socializes and reproduces individuals\nwork economic\nsociety values and norms\nThe norm is a rule that is considered proper behavior within a group. Social institutions are made up of norms, roles, and social positions.\nA role is a set of behaviors that are expected of an individual in a social institution. Individuals have different roles in different social institutions.\nA social position is a place or status that an individual holds in a social institution. An individual's social positions are gained in different social institutions.\nSOLUTION: In contemporary societies, social institutions are highly specialized, interrelated sets of social practices. Institutions are related to other institutions, and each institution has a specific role to play in society.\nFor example, the work institution provides goods and services, and the economy includes work as part of the social system. The family institution socializes and reproduces individuals, and the education institution prepares individuals for their roles in society."}

It is a way to answer questions about how variables change together.\nIn the experimental method, the experimenter identifies the parts of a system that are missing or unknown and then assembles a study to measure how those parts affect one another. An experimental study can be designed to test a specific hypothesis, or it may be exploratory.\nIn a controlled study, the experimenter tests a hypothesis by comparing the results from an experimental group to the results from a non-experimental group. The experimental group is usually exposed to the variable or variables that are missing or unknown, while the non-experimental group is not.\nIn a quasi-experimental study, the experimenter does not have complete control over the assignment of subjects to groups. This is often the case in observational studies of human behavior.\nA key characteristic of the experimental method is that it allows researchers to establish causation. However, it is important to note that causation cannot be established without an experimental study.\nSOLUTION: Testing out new research methods to see which one works best is not the experimental method. This description is more consistent with a theoretical paradigm.\nIsolating and measuring the effect of one variable upon another is part of the experimental method. It involves identifying the parts of a system that are missing or unknown and then measuring how they affect each other.\nUsing personal beliefs and values to decide what to study is not the experimental method.

For example, when people are deciding what restaurant to go to, they may ask several people for recommendations. Over the course of these conversations, they may find that they are all suggesting the same restaurant.\nEmergent-norm. This theory explains that social norms arise from the expectations that people have for how others will behave. For example, people may begin to expect that when they are out to dinner, they will order food rather than just eating the free bread at the table.\nContagion. This theory explains that behavior can be caught from other people. For example, if one person in a group is laughing, others will start laughing as well.\nValue-added.

This means that in these countries, children are less likely to end up in a different occupational category than their parents.\nIn these countries, the occupational categories that are likely to endure over generations are the ones that require specific skills, as well as the ones that require long-term commitments from employees. For example, doctors, lawyers, and other professionals are likely to have high inter-generational mobility. On the other hand, occupational categories that do not require specific skills or long-term commitments from employees are likely to have low inter-generational mobility. For example, unskilled laborers and short-term employees are likely to have low inter-generational mobility.\nSOLUTION: Inter-generational mobility refers to movement into different occupational categories between generations.

This type of discrimination can be based on race, ethnicity, or sex.\nWhen a society institutionalizes a type of discrimination, that is, when it makes discrimination a part of its social institutions, it frees its members from the burden of considering individual differences. Instead, the society can focus on the group differences and treat individuals based on the group they belong to.\nFor example, if a society institutionalizes discrimination based on race, it may replace merit-based selection with race-based selection. This new selection process will treat individuals based on their race rather than on their individual merit.\nSOLUTION: Societies often have a tendency to blame others for their problems. This can be a result of ethnocentrism, or the belief that one's own group is better than others.\nWhen a society scapegoats a particular group, it is assigning blame to that group for the problems of the society. But, as the chart below shows, this type of thinking is often based on stereotypes and is not an accurate picture of the situation."}

These are diseases that are spread through communities, usually through public facilities, such as water sources, or by contact with other people. Some communicable diseases, such as influenza, are spread through the air. Other communicable diseases, such as bubonic plague, are spread by rats and other vermin.\nStage 2 was characterized by noncommunicable diseases. These are diseases that are not spread through communities. They can be caused by viruses or bacteria, but they do not affect large numbers of people within a community. Instead, these diseases are often caused by lifestyle factors, such as smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke are examples of noncommunicable diseases.\nStage 3 was characterized by diseases of aging. These are diseases that are more likely to affect people as they get older. Some diseases of aging, such as osteoporosis, are caused by a lack of a certain hormone. Other diseases of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.\nSOLUTION: In stage 3 of the health transition, the main causes of illness and death are chronic, degenerative diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and strokes.

These prices, in turn, are determined by the forces of supply and demand.\nWhen demand is high and supply is low, prices rise. As prices rise, consumers will demand less of the good or service. Producers will respond to the lower demand by decreasing the supply of the good or service. Higher prices also encourage producers to increase production.\nWhen demand is low and supply is high, prices fall. As prices fall, consumers will demand more of the good or service. Producers will respond to the higher demand by increasing the supply of the good or service. Lower prices also discourage producers to increase production.\nIn the public sector, prices do not rise or fall in response to the forces of supply and demand. So, in a market economy, prices play a critical role in rationing goods and services that are in demand beyond the supply.\nHowever, prices do not always ration efficiently. One reason is that some goods and services are public goods or externalities. Rationing by price does not work well for these goods and services.\nA public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable means that it is impossible to exclude people from using the good. Non-rivalrous means that one person's use of the good does not decrease the amount of the good available for others to use.\nAn externality is a cost or benefit that is not reflected in the price of a good or service. For example, the cost of air pollution is an externality. The price of a good or service does not include the cost of the externality.\nGovernments often use regulations and taxes to correct for these types of market failures. These regulations and taxes can be designed to raise the price of goods and services when the externality is a cost and to lower the price when the externality is a benefit.\nSOLUTION: The introduction of market disciplines to measure police performance is an example of a regulatory mechanism. It is designed to correct for a market failure.\nThe market failure that the introduction of market disciplines to measure police performance is intended to correct is the inability of people to observe the quality of police protection. The price of police protection cannot be observed when it is provided. This market failure leads to under-provision of police protection."}

One important purpose of a psychological study is to identify correlations. A correlation is an association between two things that may be caused by one or both of the things. For example, there is a correlation between wearing shoes and not catching a cold. This correlation does not necessarily mean that wearing shoes prevents colds. It only means that colds and shoe-wearing are associated.\nPsychological studies often use surveys to gather data. Surveys can be conducted on the phone, in person, or using the Internet. Many surveys ask participants to respond to a set of statements by indicating their level of agreement. For example, a survey might ask participants to indicate how much they agree with the statement \"I feel comfortable around people who wear heavy perfume.\"\nCorrelations can be found by comparing the responses of survey participants. For example, if many participants agree with the statement \"I feel comfortable around people who wear heavy perfume,\" that correlation may be found. However, it is important to keep in mind that the correlation does not necessarily mean that perfume caused the feeling.\nAnother popular way to gather data is the experiment. In an experiment, researchers change the variable that is believed to cause the effect. For example, if researchers want to find out if watering a flower more heavily affects its growth, they might water some flowers more heavily than others. The flowers that are watered more heavily will grow more than the flowers that are not. However, it is important to keep in mind that the experiment does not necessarily mean that watering affected the growth of the flower."}

For example, a leading question would be, \"Don't you think this school has great teachers?\"\nWhat is a fixed-choice question?\nA fixed-choice question is a question that provides a limited number of response options. Fixed-choice questions should be used sparingly.\nWhat is a short question?\nA short question is a question that can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" Short questions are OK if they are used sparingly.\nWhat is a funnel question?\nA funnel question is a question that asks respondents to consider a broad topic or issue, but limits the answers to a narrow response option. Funnel questions are not good because they can lead to false answers. For example, a funnel question would be, \"How concerned are you about the environment?\" The answer would be one of the following: \"Not at all,\" \"A little,\" \"Somewhat,\" or \"Very.\"\nSOLUTION: A survey should avoid asking leading questions.\nA leading question is a question that prompts a certain response. For example, \"Do you think this school has great teachers?\" Leading questions are not good because they make it easy for respondents to answer incorrectly."}

Through the ages, religions have variously embraced or rejected cultural values such as hierarchies, individualism, or skepticism.\nFor example, in the 1960 s, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, reacted against the hierarchical values of their time by stressing the equality of all people.\nIn the 1970 s and 1980 s, the Unification Church of the United States, founded by Sun Myung Moon, embraced the individualism of American culture by teaching that its members could achieve a deeper level of individual freedom through their beliefs.\nMore recently, some religions have reacted against the materialistic values of modern culture by emphasizing spiritual values instead.\nOther religions, however, have embraced contemporary values, such as the importance of healthy relationships.\nThe traditions of most religions include a mix of teachings that reflect the cultural values of their time.\nSOLUTION: To answer this question, you need to consider the typical teachings of each religion.\nThe Unification Church reacts against the loss of any meaningful religious content in the teachings of churches. It stresses the importance of spiritual growth and the importance of following the teachings of its founder.\nThe church adopts an attitude of mild disapproval towards mainstream social values. It encourages its members to see the world in a unique way and to resist the negative ideas of society.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rejects both the goals and means of conventional society and provides utopian alternatives. It teaches that the world is in a state of crisis and that its members can help build a better world.\nThe teachings of the Unification Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both reflect the values of their founders. But unlike world-affirming religions, these religions do not embrace conventional cultural values."}

Every member of the population has a known, nonzero chance of being chosen. Non-probability sampling is used when it is not practical to take a random sample.\nCluster sampling involves the division of the population into clusters, and then the selection of clusters rather than individual observations. This technique is often used when the population is large or spread out over a large area.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is B.\nNon-probability sampling is used when it is not practical to take a random sample. Instead of randomly selecting individuals, non-probability sampling involves selecting individuals based on criteria that are easy to measure."}

They point to the presence of an intermediate stratum of professionals, managers, and technicians who are not on the bottom rung of the ladder but are not in the top 1 percent either. These scholars suggest that this intermediate stratum has prevented the working class from making economic gains and has limited the growth of the financial and industrial elites.\nOther scholars argue that class polarization has occurred in American society.

People who earn more can buy more welfare. For example, people could buy more life insurance or more disability insurance.\nMeans-testing is the process of only providing government benefits to those who are in need. Means-testing can prevent waste and abuse.\nHowever, there are problems with the market model of welfare.\nFirst, not all welfare is suitable for buying privately. Health insurance, unemployment insurance, and unemployment benefits are examples of types of welfare that people need to pool together.\nSecond, private welfare is expensive. Means-tested programs are less expensive, but they can be difficult to administer.\nUniversal programs, which provide welfare to all people, are less expensive and more fair.\nThe government provides universal programs because private markets cannot provide some types of welfare.\nFor example, the government provides old-age and survivors insurance (Social Security) and disability insurance. These programs provide a basic level of welfare to all people who have paid into the programs.\nSOLUTION: The market model of state welfare is based on the principle of individuals buying welfare privately, with some means-tested benefits.\nMeans-testing is one way to make welfare more affordable. But it is not the only way.\nA universalist system of welfare for all, regardless of income, is the opposite of the market model.\nRegular benefit payments to men as earners of the 'family wage' is not the principle of the market model of state welfare.\nDecommodifying social welfare through state provision is the opposite of the market model."}

{"question": "Giselle graduated from college with high honors in management. She was recruited immediately following college by a large corporation and accepted a position in junior management. She quickly advanced to middle management. Ten years later Giselle was still in a middle-management position and had witnessed junior male colleagues promoted over her. Which of the following is a phenomenon that is most likely to explain Giselle's lack of promotion?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glass ceiling"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gender constancy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Underemployment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Glass elevator"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Sociologists debate whether or not there is a glass ceiling for men. Research by sociologists such as Paula England and Joya Misra suggests that a glass ceiling may affect men as well as women. However, the glass ceiling may affect men in different ways than it does women. For example, men are more likely than women to be promoted to high-level positions in fields such as finance and construction, which are often considered \"male\" industries.\nMost sociologists think that the glass ceiling is caused by stereotypes and prejudice. Stereotypes are beliefs about what is typical or normal for people of a particular group. Prejudice is a negative attitude that some people hold against others who are part of a group. These stereotypes and prejudices can create expectations and assumptions about what men and women can do. These expectations can limit the opportunities that groups of people have.\nSOLUTION: Glass ceiling is a phenomenon that is most likely to explain Giselle's lack of promotion. The glass ceiling is a barrier to advancement that is based on stereotypes and prejudice. It may limit the opportunities that women, or men, have for promotion.\nGender constancy is the idea that children believe that gender, a person's male or female identity, remains the same. Gender constancy is not a phenomenon that explains why Giselle was not promoted.\nUnderemployment is when someone who is working is not using his or her skills or education. Underemployment is not a phenomenon that explains why Giselle was not promoted.\nGlass elevator is a metaphor for the glass ceiling. It is a phenomenon that is most likely to explain Giselle's lack of promotion."}

The aristocracy owned the land and controlled agricultural work. Most farm workers were poor, and their lives were relatively hard.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, machines changed the way work was done. New jobs were created in factories. The jobs were not as well paid as farm work, but they were better than working the land. The new jobs brought people from the countryside to the cities.\nService work has become the most common type of employment in recent times. Many service jobs are administrative or professional. These jobs are often better paid than factory or manual jobs.\nSOLUTION: Goldenthorpe defined the service class as those in non-manual occupations, exercising authority on behalf of the state.\nGoldenthorpe did not identify the service class as those who had worked in the armed services.\nGoldenthorpe did not identify the service class as those in non-manual occupations, exercising authority on behalf of big business.\nGoldenthorpe identified the service class as those in non-manual occupations, exercising authority on behalf of the state."}

Indoctrination and propaganda are used to maintain control over citizens. One-party rule allows the party to make all decisions for the society. The leader has complete control over the government. A centrally planned economy is planned and controlled by the government. There is no freedom of speech or expression. The society's needs come before the needs of the individual.\nSOLUTION: A centrally planned economy is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies.

In Bowlbys case, other scholars claimed that poverty was the main cause of emotionally insecure children. However, Bowlby argued that children who suffered from emotional insecurity in the face of stress were not necessarily poor or disadvantaged. In fact, he claimed that some children who were emotionally insecure came from relatively privileged homes.\nBowlby's maternal deprivation thesis claimed that children who were deprived of an early, secure attachment to their mother were prone to suffer physically, intellectually, and socially in later life.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is B. It is not the case that mothers who are living in poverty cannot afford to give their children the resources that other children enjoy. Also, children do not suffer from deprivation because their mothers are living in poverty. Instead, children who are deprived of an early, secure attachment to their mother are prone to suffer physically, intellectually, and socially in later life."}
