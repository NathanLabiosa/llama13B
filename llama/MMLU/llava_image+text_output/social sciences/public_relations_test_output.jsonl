In that year, a group of radio enthusiasts who called themselves the Radio Club of America formed an organization to promote the development of broadcasting. The group helped to establish the first radio station in the United States, which began broadcasting in January 1922.\nBefore 1922, there was no organized broadcasting. Radio stations went up and down the dial as they pleased, and listeners had to be within earshot of the station to hear the programming.\nThe first radio station in the United States was founded by a man named Charles Herrold. In 1909, he started broadcasting from his school in San Jose, California. However, his broadcasts were sporadic, and he was not always on the air.\nIn 1910, a man named Lee De Forest invented a device called the audion, which made it possible to amplify electrical signals. This was an important step toward the development of radio.\nIn 1912, President William Howard Taft helped to get the first patent for a broadcasting technology.\nIn 1917, the first licensed radio station in the United States, WWV, began broadcasting.\nIn 1920, the first non-licensed radio station, KDKA, began broadcasting.\nIn 1921, the Radio Act was passed. It required radio stations to be licensed by the federal government."}
