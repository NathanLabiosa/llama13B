One of these tools is monetary policy. The leader of the central bank can use tools such as lowering interest rates or buying bonds to try to increase the money supply and stimulate spending in the economy.\nWhen the central bank wants to increase the money supply, it is engaging in an expansionary monetary policy. When the central bank wants to decrease the money supply, it is engaging in a contractionary monetary policy.\nA depreciating dollar is when the value of the dollar is lower than it was before. This makes goods and services cheaper for people in other countries, and it makes other countries' goods and services more expensive for U.S. consumers.\nFiscal policy is another tool that governments can use to help the economy. Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. When a government spends more money, it is engaging in expansionary fiscal policy. When a government collects more money from the economy, it is engaging in contractionary fiscal policy.\nSOLUTION: A depreciating dollar is when the value of the dollar is lower than it was before. This makes goods and services cheaper for people in other countries, and it makes other countries' goods and services more expensive for U.S. consumers.\nA depreciating dollar will usually cause the prices of imported goods and services to go up. This will cause the prices of goods and services in the United States to go up. When the prices of goods and services in the United States go up, it is called inflation.\nInflation is usually caused by expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. So, a depreciating dollar is a likely cause of inflation."}

Producers do not produce more or less than the amount that consumers are willing to buy.\nAllocative efficiency is achieved when there are no unused resources. An efficient economy is one in which no inferior products are created. An inferior product is one that is not worth the amount that it costs to produce.\nWhen resources are used to produce an inferior product, it means that they are not used to produce a better product. In other words, resources are not being allocated efficiently.\nAllocative efficiency does not necessarily mean that those who work hardest get more. This is because some resources are not related to how hard people work. For example, people who have a lot of capital, such as money, can produce more goods and services than people who have less capital. But having more capital does not necessarily mean that someone has worked harder.\nAllocative efficiency also does not necessarily mean that the economy's output is distributed evenly. Some resources are more productive than others. So, it is possible for some people to have more of the economy's output than others, as long as the output is produced efficiently."}

What does society produce? How does society decide what to produce? How does society pay for what it produces?\nThe questions of what to produce and how to pay for it are at the heart of economic decision making. Government and other institutions take on different roles in answering these questions.\nFor example, in the United States, the federal government has decided to fund research on cancer at a national laboratory. The laboratory will employ scientists and support personnel. The funding for the laboratory will come from taxes on U.S. citizens.\nIn this case, the question of who will work at the laboratory and who will pay the taxes answers the questions of who will do the work and who will make the economic decision.\nThe question of who should pay taxes is also an economic question. When government budgets are over-ridden, the tax burden may be shifted from one group to another. For example, if taxes are raised on cigarettes, the burden may be shifted to smokers.\nThe question of who will get how much of each good and service is not a fundamental economic question.

The CPI is a measure of the average change in prices that consumers pay for a fixed market basket of goods and services. The CPI can be used to help people understand how much the cost of living has changed.\nWhen the prices of goods and services rise, the GDP deflator also increases. The GDP deflator is a measure of the average change in prices of all goods and services produced within an economy. It can be used to calculate the real value of GDP.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the price of forklifts imported into the United States from Belgium will increase the import price index. Because the import price index is a part of the GDP deflator, the increase will also increase the GDP deflator. But the import price index is not a part of the consumer price index, so the increase will not affect the consumer price index."}

When the international value of the dollar is high, foreigners find it more expensive to buy goods and services in the United States. This makes U.S. goods and services more expensive for foreigners, which in turn lowers the demand for U.S. exports.\nOn the other hand, when the international value of the dollar is low, foreigners find it less expensive to buy goods and services in the United States. This makes U.S. goods and services less expensive for foreigners, which in turn raises the demand for U.S. exports.\nThere are several things that can make the international value of the dollar rise or fall. One important thing is the interest rate on U.S. short-term government bonds. When the interest rate on these bonds is lower than the interest rates in other countries, the international value of the dollar tends to rise. This happens because U.S. bonds become more attractive to foreign investors.\nAnother important thing is the amount of money in circulation. When there is more money in circulation, the international value of the dollar tends to fall. This happens because the higher level of money in circulation raises the demand for goods and services in the United States. This, in turn, raises the prices of U.S. goods and services, making them more expensive for foreigners.\nSOLUTION: American interest rates fall relative to interest rates in other countries.\nWhen American interest rates fall relative to interest rates in other countries, the international value of the dollar tends to rise. This happens because U.S. bonds become more attractive to foreign investors.\nForeigners boycott American products.\nForeigners boycotting American products would cause the international value of the dollar to fall. This happens because the boycott would lower the demand for U.S. exports.\nAmerican income falls relative to the rest of the world.\nAmerican income falls relative to the rest of the world.

For example, if the average income in the world rose from $20 to $22, but the average income in the United States rose from $10 to $11, the international value of the dollar would tend to fall.\nAmerican prices rise.\nWhen American prices rise, the international value of the dollar tends to fall.

The value of a currency depends on the demand for it. When more people want a currency, the value goes up. When less people want a currency, the value goes down.\nYou can change the demand for a currency by buying or selling it. For example, if you buy a currency, you are giving a country more money. This goes up the demand for the currency, which makes the value go up.\nSOLUTION: Economic growth, the savings rate, and the price level all affect the demand for a country's currency.\nEconomic growth makes people's incomes go up. When incomes go up, people have more money to spend. Because they have more money to spend, the demand for the currency goes up.\nThe savings rate tells you how much of their incomes people save. If people save more of their incomes, they spend less. The demand for the currency goes down.\nThe price level tells you how much people pay for goods and services.

The money supply is a key part of the Monetarist model of the economy. Everything else in the model depends on the money supply.\nWhen the money supply is increased, the value of money decreases. So, the price level goes up. The price level is the average price level in an economy.\nThe money supply is also used to calculate the interest rate. When the money supply is increased, the interest rate is lowered. When the money supply is decreased, the interest rate is raised.\nThe interest rate affects many parts of the economy.

To do this, money must serve three functions: a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange.\nA store of value allows you to save money today and have a store of value in the future. A good store of value maintains its value over time.\nA unit of account makes it possible to express the value of a good or service in a common unit.\nA medium of exchange makes it easy to trade with others.\nFinancial markets are places where people trade financial assets. Financial assets are pieces of paper or digital transcriptions that show that you own a portion of a particular asset.\nFor example, if you buy a stock, you become an owner of a small portion of a company. If you buy a bond, you lend money to a company or a government.\nSOLUTION: A macroeconomic recession increases the demand for loanable funds.\nWhen the economy is in a recession, the demand for loanable funds increases. This is because the velocity of money decreases, and people exchange money for bonds.\nAs the demand for bonds increases, the interest rate increases.\nWhen the demand for bonds increases, the interest rate increases. This is because the price of bonds and the interest rate are inversely related.\nFor a given money supply if nominal GDP increases the velocity of money decreases.\nWhen nominal GDP increases, the velocity of money falls. The money supply is still fixed, but the nominal GDP is increasing. So, the velocity of money must decrease.\nWhen demand for stocks and bonds increases the asset demand for money falls.\nWhen the demand for both stocks and bonds increases, the demand for money falls. This is because money is now being used to buy other assets."}

This can make its currency less valuable relative to other currencies.\nSOLUTION: When a nation consistently borrows to cover its annual budget deficits, it risks a depreciation of its currency.\nBorrowing increases the demand for the nation's currency. When there is more demand for a currency, its value tends to rise. But if a nation spends the money it borrows on imports or pays the interest on its loans in foreign currency, the increased demand for its currency will not cause its currency to appreciate.\nIf a nation spends the money it borrows on imports, the imports will become more expensive for consumers. So, the nation's goods will become less competitive with foreign goods. This will lower the nation's export earnings and potentially cause a decline in net exports.\nLower interest rates will not necessarily discourage foreign investment in the nation. If a nation is borrowing to fund its annual budget deficits, it may be perceived as a riskier investment. But lower interest rates can make other investments more attractive. So, lower interest rates may not discourage foreign investment in the nation.\nAn appreciation of the nation's currency will occur if foreigners decrease their investment in the nation. This can lower the demand for the nation's currency. But an appreciation of the nation's currency would make its goods and services more expensive for foreign consumers. So, an appreciation of the nation's currency would lower the nation's net exports."}

When the government spends more money, it puts more money into the economy. As a result, crowding-out occurs when the government spends more money on its own goods and services, adding to the demand for those goods and services and leaving less demand for the goods and services produced by the rest of the economy.\nWhen the government spends more, there is more demand for the goods and services produced by the rest of the economy. To finance this extra spending, the government can raise less taxes. So, crowding-out occurs when the government can finance its spending by collecting fewer taxes.\nSOLUTION: To reduce or eliminate crowding-out, expansionary fiscal policy can be accompanied by a decrease in investment or a decrease in the demand for the goods and services produced by the rest of the economy. This decrease in demand can be achieved by an increase in saving or by an expansionary monetary policy.\nAn increase in government spending would be a type of expansionary fiscal policy. It would add to the demand for goods and services in the economy.

In the short run, fiscal policy can be expansionary or contractionary.\nAn expansionary fiscal policy is usually implemented in times of recession. It involves increasing government spending and decreasing taxes. The increase in spending puts more money into the economy, and the decrease in taxes gives people more money to spend.\nA contractionary fiscal policy is usually implemented in times of inflation. It involves decreasing government spending and increasing taxes. The decrease in spending takes money out of the economy, and the increase in taxes takes money out of the economy as well.\nSOLUTION: The appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession is increased taxes and government spending.\nIn a recession, the government can use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. It can do this by increasing taxes and government spending. Increased government spending puts more money into the economy, and increased taxes give people more money to spend.\nThe other choices are not necessarily incorrect, but they are not necessarily the best way to remedy a recession. Running a deficit calls for the federal government to run a deficit. A deficit is when government spending exceeds tax revenue. Though running a deficit can be an effective way to stimulate the economy in the short run, it can also be dangerous. If the government spends too much money, it may not be able to pay for it. In the long run, running a deficit can lead to a higher national debt.\nRunning a surplus calls for the federal government to run a surplus. A surplus is when government tax revenue exceeds government spending. Though a surplus may help keep the economy strong in the long run, it can make a recession worse. If the government is taking more money out of the economy than it is putting into the economy, it can make the recession worse."}

The crowding out effect is a result of the way government debt can affect the economy. When the government spends money, it may have to borrow money to do so. This borrowing increases the demand for bonds, and the increased demand for bonds drives up their price. As the price of bonds goes up, the interest rate on bonds goes down. When the interest rate on bonds goes down, it also leads to a decrease in private investment. The decrease in private investment resulting from the crowding out effect can reduce potential output and cause unemployment to increase."}

There are several ways in which real GDP can fall.\nWhen the money supply is increased, the value of each dollar falls. As a result, the price of goods and services also falls. Although the center of mass of the demand curve for goods and services shifts to the left, it also shifts down. The decrease in price outweighs the increase in demand, so the quantity demanded falls.\nWhen the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies is high, foreign goods and services are more expensive. As a result, the quantity demanded of foreign goods and services falls. Because these goods and services are not produced in the United States, their absence contributes to a decrease in real GDP.\nInvestment in human capital is high when people are investing more in their own skills. Human capital refers to the knowledge and skills people have. When people learn more, they become more productive, and GDP rises.\nTariffs and quotas are removed because tariffs and quotas are taxes on imports.

Financial assets are items that represent a claim on something else. For example, a stock is a financial asset that represents a claim on a portion of a company.\nWhen investors buy stocks, they are buying a claim on a portion of a company. In other words, by buying stocks, investors are lending money to the company. In return, investors hope to get some of the company's profits, plus any increase in the stock price.\nSOLUTION: Investors are the source of the supply of loanable funds. Investors include people and companies that have money to lend. When they lend money, they are supplying loanable funds.\nIn the stock market, investors can lend money to companies by buying bonds. Companies can also lend money to investors by issuing bonds in the stock market.\nNet exports are the difference between a country's exports and its imports. A country receives money when it exports more goods and services than it imports. A country spends the money when it imports more goods and services than it exports.\nSavers are people or companies that save their money. They do not spend all the money they make. Instead, they keep some of the money.\nThe stock market is a place where investors can buy and sell financial assets. It is not the source of the supply of loanable funds."}

So, for every additional dollar of income, there is a smaller increase in consumption. As a result, higher government spending will lead to a smaller increase in consumption.\nOn the other hand, when the marginal propensity to consume is higher, people consume a larger proportion of each additional dollar of income.

Exports are added to GDP because they are foreign goods and services that the country does produce.\nThe effect of a firm moving a manufacturing plant into a country is different. The new country gains the productive capacity of the firm, but the country that the firm leaves suffers a loss of productive capacity. So, GDP falls in the country that the firm leaves and rises in the country that the firm moves into.\nSOLUTION: This question describes the move as a decrease in productive capacity in the United States and an increase in productive capacity in Brazil.

Productivity can be used to compare the output of different countries.\nOutput is the amount of goods and services produced. It is possible for one country to have a higher output than another country, but not necessarily have a higher standard of living. For example, a country may have a higher output because it has a larger population. But a larger population does not necessarily mean that the country has a higher standard of living.\nLiving standards describe the quality of life in a country. Living standards can be compared by looking at things like the average income, the quality of health care, and the number of years people go to school.\nSOLUTION: To determine which country has a higher standard of living, look at the output and population of each country. Then consider which country has a higher average output per person.\nCountry A has an average output per person of 1200/100 = 12 units.\nCountry B has an average output per person of 2400/400 = 6 units.\nCountry A has a higher average output per person than Country B.

If taxes decrease, the tax multiplier is positive. If taxes increase, the tax multiplier is negative.\nThe tax multiplier can be used to determine the change in national income that results from a change in taxes. For example, if the tax multiplier is 3, a decrease in taxes equal to 1% of national income will increase national income by 3%.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the marginal propensity to consume increases the size of the tax multiplier. The marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of an additional dollar of income that is spent. For a given tax rate, an increase in the marginal propensity to consume means that people are spending a larger proportion of their income. As a result, the spending multiplier is increased, which increases the size of the tax multiplier.\nAn increase in the reserve ratio decreases the size of the tax multiplier. The reserve ratio is the ratio of reserves to deposits. An increase in the reserve ratio means that banks have more reserves relative to deposits. This excess of reserves reduces the interest rate, which decreases the spending multiplier and the tax multiplier.\nAn increase in the marginal propensity to save decreases the size of the tax multiplier. The marginal propensity to save is the proportion of an additional dollar of income that is saved. For a given tax rate, an increase in the marginal propensity to save means that people are saving a larger proportion of their income. As a result, the spending multiplier is decreased, which decreases the size of the tax multiplier.\nA decrease in the spending multiplier decreases the size of the tax multiplier. The spending multiplier is the change in national income divided by the change in spending.

The break-even point is the point at which total revenue equals total expenses.\nThe break-even point is important because it indicates the point at which a company is not making a profit nor incurring a loss. Below the break-even point, the company is incurring a loss. Above the break-even point, the company is making a profit.\nThere are several things you should know about the break-even point:\nThe break-even point is a function of total fixed costs, total variable costs, and the quantity of product sold.\nAt the break-even point, the total variable costs are equal to the total fixed costs.\nThe break-even point is sensitive to changes in either total fixed costs or total variable costs.\nIf total fixed costs increase, the break-even point also increases.\nIf total fixed costs decrease, the break-even point also decreases.\nIf total variable costs increase, the break-even point also increases.\nIf total variable costs decrease, the break-even point also decreases.\nSOLUTION: The break-even point occurs when total revenue equals total expenses. At this point, total variable costs equal total fixed costs.\nThe expenses of corporations just equal their revenues.\nThe break-even point occurs when total revenue equals total expenses.

When the government changes taxation or government spending, it affects the demand for goods and services. And when demand changes, so does the size of the economy's macroeconomic balance, or gap.\nAn expansionary fiscal policy is usually implemented when the economy is in a recession. When the economy is in a recession, the government can use an expansionary fiscal policy to eliminate a recessionary gap. A recessionary gap is a difference between the economy's actual output and its potential output. When the economy is in a recession, the actual output is lower than the potential output.\nTo eliminate a recessionary gap, the government can increase its spending on goods and services or decrease its taxes. When the government decreases taxes, it increases the after-tax income of consumers and businesses. As a result, consumers and businesses will increase their spending, which will increase the actual output.\nA contractionary fiscal policy is usually implemented when the economy is experiencing inflation. When the economy is experiencing inflation, the government can use a contractionary fiscal policy to reduce the inflationary gap. An inflationary gap is a difference between the economy's actual output and its potential output. When the economy is experiencing inflation, the actual output is higher than the potential output.\nTo reduce the inflationary gap, the government can decrease its spending on goods and services or increase its taxes. When the government increases taxes, it decreases the after-tax income of consumers and businesses. As a result, consumers and businesses will decrease their spending, which will decrease the actual output.\nA neutral fiscal policy is implemented when the economy is operating at its potential output. At the potential output, the economy is neither in a recession nor in an inflation. To maintain the economy at its potential output, the government can keep its spending on goods and services equal to its taxes.\nSOLUTION: The question tells you that there is an inflationary gap. An inflationary gap is a difference between the economy's actual output and its potential output. The actual output is higher than the potential output.\nYou can see that there is an inflationary gap by looking at the actual output and the potential output. The actual output is higher than the potential output.\nSo, the government can use a contractionary fiscal policy to reduce the inflationary gap. A contractionary fiscal policy is usually implemented when the economy is experiencing inflation. When the economy is experiencing inflation, the government can use a contractionary fiscal policy to reduce the inflationary gap. An inflationary gap is a difference between the economy's actual output and its potential output.

Expansionary monetary policy involves growing the money supply or reducing interest rates.\nWhen the money supply grows or interest rates are reduced, consumers and businesses can afford to spend more. As a result, the demand for goods and services increases, which leads to an increase in production. Businesses make a profit, and people have jobs.\nThere are several ways in which expansionary monetary policy can increase employment and real GDP. For example, when the money supply grows, interest rates are reduced, and borrowing is cheaper. This makes it easier for businesses to expand, which in turn leads to an increase in employment and real GDP.\nWhen the price level is increasing, the value of money is decreasing. This means that each dollar buys fewer goods and services. Inflation makes it difficult for businesses to plan for the future. They do not know how the value of money will change. As a result, businesses may be reluctant to invest, expand, or create new jobs.\nA decrease in interest rates makes borrowing cheaper. This can help businesses expand and create jobs.\nAn increase in the money supply makes it cheaper to buy goods and services. This can help increase employment and real GDP.\nSOLUTION: Decreases aggregate demand so that the price level falls is a predictable effect of expansionary monetary policy in a recession. When the money supply grows or interest rates are reduced, consumers and businesses can afford to spend more. As a result, the demand for goods and services increases, which leads to an increase in production.

If there is a domestic surplus, it means that resources are organizing to produce more than consumers want to buy.\nA domestic surplus means that some resources are not being used. These resources will be idle or underutilized. Other resources may be overutilized.\nWhen there is a domestic surplus, the government can begin to export goods or services or import goods or services. Doing so will increase the domestic price of the traded good or service. The increased price will help to use resources that were sitting idle or underutilized.\nA domestic shortage means that consumers want to buy more than domestic resources can produce. If there is a domestic shortage, consumers will not be able to buy as much of the good or service as they want.\nWhen there is a domestic shortage, the government can begin to import goods or services or begin to export goods or services. Doing so will increase the world price of the traded good or service. The increased price will encourage domestic resources to produce more of the good or service.\nSOLUTION: With free trade, the world price is lower than the domestic price. The world price is the price at which other countries sell the good. The lower the world price, the more goods other countries are selling.\nSo, the United States begins to import rice to make up for a domestic shortage."}

Labor productivity can be affected by various factors, including investment in capital, technological advances, and changes in the economy's organization and structure.\nWhen labor productivity increases, the economy can produce more goods and services with the same amount of input. As a result of increased productivity, the price level tends to rise (inflation) as demand for goods and services outstrips the supply.\nWhen labor productivity decreases, the economy is unable to produce as much as before. The price level tends to fall (deflation) as supply grows greater than demand.\nInvestment is the purchase of goods and services that are used in the production of other goods and services. An uptick in investment could be caused by lower interest rates, increased consumer confidence, or new technologies. When investment increases, labor productivity usually increases, and the price level tends to rise.\nA technological advance is a new invention in the production process that increases labor productivity. When a technological advance occurs, the price level tends to rise as labor productivity increases.\nA decline in investment means that funds are not being used to invest in new capital or to expand existing capital. Instead, the funds are being used for another purpose. When investment declines, labor productivity usually decreases, and the price level tends to fall.\nAn uptick in net exports means that the value of the goods and services that a country exports increases. This could be caused by a price increase or an increase in the quantity demanded for those exports. When net exports increase, real GDP increases, and the price level tends to rise.\nA decrease in labor productivity means that the economy is producing fewer goods and services than before. This decrease in real GDP tends to decrease the price level.\nSOLUTION: An uptick in net exports does not directly affect real GDP or the price level. However, increased exports do increase real GDP, and the resulting rise in the price level could lead to an inflationary gap.\nA decrease in labor productivity decreases real GDP and tends to decrease the price level.\nAn uptick in net exports could be caused by a price increase or an increase in the quantity demanded for those exports. A price increase could be caused by a terms-of-trade increase, which involves both the price of exports and the price of imports. A terms-of-trade increase could be caused by a decrease in the world price of imports and an increase in the world price of exports. In this case, both the price level and real GDP would increase."}

The reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks are required to hold in their vaults.\nIf the reserve ratio is 10 percent, it means that banks are required to hold reserves equal to 10 percent of their deposits. The other 90 percent of their deposits can be lent out or invested.\nThe Fed controls the money supply by changing the reserve ratio. If the Fed raises the reserve ratio, it makes it more difficult for banks to lend out or invest their deposits. This reduces the money supply. If the Fed lowers the reserve ratio, it makes it easier for banks to lend out or invest their deposits. This increases the money supply.\nThe central bank of the United States is the Federal Reserve. It uses its tools, including the reserve ratio, to achieve its monetary policy objectives. The Fed's main objective is to keep inflation between 1 and 2 percent.

Capital goods are the tools and equipment that businesses use to produce goods and services. When businesses use more capital goods, they can produce more goods and services.\nInvestment tax credits are credits that businesses can use to reduce their taxes. These credits incentivize businesses to invest in capital goods. The effect of investment tax credits is to lower the cost of investing in capital goods. This makes it cheaper for businesses to produce goods and services. So, by using investment tax credits, a country's economy can grow faster.\nA falling stock of capital goods is a decrease in the stock of capital goods. This decrease makes it harder for businesses to produce goods and services. So, a falling stock of capital goods is less likely to produce stronger economic growth over time.\nMore rapid consumption of natural resources. and higher adult illiteracy rates are also less likely to produce stronger economic growth over time. Consuming natural resources faster will lead to a decline in the stock of natural resources. This will make it harder for businesses to produce goods and services.

The central bank invests the excess reserves in the banking system by making deposits into banks. The banks can then use these deposits to make loans to customers.\nThe central bank changes the interest rate by changing the rate charged by banks to lend and borrow money.

So, an expansionary monetary policy, which increases the money supply, can help stimulate economic growth. On the other hand, a contractionary monetary policy, which decreases the money supply, can help control inflation.\nSOLUTION: Expansionary policy is appropriate when the economy is in a recession. When the economy is in a recession, there is not enough aggregate demand. Expansionary policy can help increase aggregate demand.\nIf the demand for money is perfectly elastic, expansionary monetary policy might be quite effective. An expansionary monetary policy greatly increases aggregate demand if investment is sensitive to changes in the interest rate.\nContractionary policy is the appropriate stimulus for investment and consumption.

There are several ways that real GDP can increase:\nAn increase in government spending, or expenditures, will increase real GDP. When the government spends more money, it hires other people's time, and that makes goods and services appear on the market.\nAn increase in private investment also appears as an increase in real GDP. When companies invest more money in their businesses, they hire people to work on the investment. The people's work appears as new goods and services on the market.\nAn increase in consumption, or C, also appears as an increase in real GDP. When people spend more money, they hire other people's time. The people's work appears as new goods and services on the market.\nAn increase in the real rate of interest will not increase real GDP. An increase in the real interest rate will decrease consuming and investing, which will decrease real GDP.\nAn increase in taxes will not increase real GDP. An increase in taxes will decrease consuming and investing, which will decrease real GDP.\nA decrease in net exports will not increase real GDP.

Government regulation can have many benefits, such as protecting the environment, protecting consumers, and promoting social justice.\nMore strict pollution standards for corporations is an example of government regulation. When corporations are forced to reduce their pollution, they must do so by making changes in their production processes. These changes can be expensive, so the corporations may pass on some of the costs to their customers. For example, corporations may charge higher prices for their products or ask for government help.\nIncreased taxes is a government regulation that takes money from corporations and individuals. Increased taxes can have an negative impact on economic growth. When taxes are increased, people have less money to spend or invest. When people have less money to spend or invest, demand for goods and services may decrease, and companies may have to lay off workers.\nA new production technique that lowers costs is a type of investment. Investments can help promote economic growth. When corporations invest in new machines or equipment, for example, they can work more efficiently. As a result, they may be able to lower their costs and charge lower prices for their goods and services.\nThe table below shows how each choice affects economic growth.\n | Government regulation. | A new production technique that lowers costs. | Increased taxes. | More strict pollution standards for corporations.\nEffect on economic growth | Promotes economic growth. | Promotes economic growth. | May reduce economic growth. | Promotes economic growth."}

They tell consumers and producers about the cost of goods and services. Prices are also signals that can influence the decisions people make about how much to save or spend.\nWhen goods or services are in high demand but low supply, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when goods or services are in low demand or high supply, prices tend to fall.\nIn most cases, prices in a capitalist economy are determined by supply and demand. This means that prices reflect the choices and behaviors of both consumers and producers.\nHowever, the federal government can also affect prices in a capitalist economy. For example, the government can raise or lower interest rates to influence inflation. Inflation is an increase in the general price level of goods and services. High inflation can erode the value of money.\nFinally, prices can also be a reflection of our basic values. For example, most people believe that it is wrong to charge different prices to people of different races or ethnic groups. Whether or not prices reflect our basic values depends on the culture and institutions of a society.\nSOLUTION: Price determination is not unfair.\nPrices are not determined by the federal government in most cases.\nPrices are a reflection of our basic values.\nSo, prices are not unfair."}

They believed that when prices were falling, it was a sign that costs were also falling. In this case, the economy was thought to be in a state of deflation.\nHowever, in the mid-1990 s, economists discovered that prices and costs could decouple. This means that prices could be falling, but costs could be rising. In other words, it is possible to have stagflation.\nStagflation is a word that was first used in the 1970 s. It is a combination of the words stagnant and inflation. When stagflation occurs, the economy is growing at a slow rate, and prices are rising. In other words, the economy is stagnant, and inflation is occurring.\nSOLUTION: An advance in technology is a possible cause of stagflation. When an advance in technology occurs, the cost of production will usually fall. But if the economy is not growing quickly, the decrease in costs will not be reflected in higher prices. Instead, the prices will probably remain the same, or they may even fall. In this case, the prices are falling, but real GDP is rising.\nAn increase in government spending is a possible cause of inflation. When government spending increases, the demand for goods and services will usually increase. As a result, prices will probably rise. But real GDP will probably not increase. In fact, real GDP may decrease.\nA decrease in government spending is a possible cause of a recession. When government spending decreases, the demand for goods and services will usually decrease. As a result, prices will probably fall. So, real GDP will probably decrease."}

When people save more and invest more, the economy's capital stock grows, and its long-term rate of growth increases.\nWhen investment decreases, the capital stock grows at a slower rate, and the economy's long-term rate of growth falls. This decrease in the capital stock leads to a decrease in the economy's long-term rate of growth.\nSo, a decline in investment would reduce economic growth.\nAn increase in immigration from abroad increases the labor force, which will lead to a temporary increase in economic growth. However, the increase in labor force will cause economic growth to increase only in the short run. In the long run, the increase in labor force will lead to an increase in the economy's capital stock, which will increase its long-term rate of growth.\nA technological advance increases the economy's productivity, which leads to an increase in long-term economic growth. A technological advance does not reduce long-term economic growth.\nAn increase in the labor force increases the economy's output in the short run. However, an increase in the labor force will also increase the demand for resources. As a result of the increase in demand for resources, the supply of resources will increase, and their prices will fall. The decrease in resource prices will decrease the supply of goods and services that can be produced with the given resources. So, in the long run, an increase in the labor force will lead to an increase in the economy's capital stock, which will increase its long-term rate of growth."}

When the price level is higher, each dollar buys fewer goods and services.\nInflation can be caused by different factors, such as an increase in wages, an increase in the money supply, or an increase in the price of oil.\nWhen the price level goes up, consumers will generally want to buy less of a good or service. So, the demand for the good or service will go down.\nIf the demand for a good or service goes down, the price of the good or service will usually go down.\nSOLUTION: Inflation discourages savings.

The government can increase spending or decrease taxes to increase demand for goods and services. This can help companies sell more products and increase employment.\nHowever, what happens next is not certain. If demand for goods and services increases, some prices will go up. As prices go up, consumers will buy less. Workers will make more, but they will also pay more for goods and services.\nSo, an increase in demand may cause prices to go up. When prices go up, demand may go down. This is called the inflationary effect of fiscal policy.\nTo get a larger effect on real GDP without a corresponding increase in the price level, the government would prefer to use a fiscal policy combination that has a high ratio of government spending to taxes. Spending more money than you collect in taxes will increase the deficit.\nSOLUTION: Increase government spending with no change in taxes. This combination has a high ratio of government spending to taxes. This suggests that the government is spending more money than it is collecting in taxes. The deficit is increasing.\nAn increase in government spending with no change in taxes would normally be expected to increase real GDP. But the price level would also increase.\nSo, this combination would slowly increase real GDP without putting tremendous upward pressure on the price level."}

In fact, Classical economists argued that the real economy grows at a constant rate.\nAn increase in the money supply does not affect the real rate of interest, which is the interest rate adjusted for inflation.\nAn increase in the money supply does not necessarily affect the inflation rate, but it does affect the rate of inflation.

One reason is to encourage banks to borrow money and lend it out. When banks do this, they help to increase the money supply. By increasing the money supply, the Fed can stimulate spending and growth.\nAnother reason the Fed might lower the discount rate is to encourage banks to move money out of their deposit accounts and into riskier investments. This can help to stimulate borrowing and investment."}

One important insight is that expectations of future events can affect the supply of a product today.\nFor example, expectations of higher prices in the future can lead to an increase in the supply of a product today. This is because higher prices expected in the future make producing the product today more lucrative.\nOn the other hand, expectations of lower prices in the future can lead to a decrease in the supply of a product today. This is because lower prices expected in the future make producing the product today less lucrative.\nSOLUTION: Firms that make a particular product expect its price will be lower in the future. So, the supply of the product will decrease right now."}
{"question": "Excess reserves in the banking system will increase if", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the reserve ratio is increased."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the checking deposits increase."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the discount rate is increased."}, {"label": "D", "text": "the Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The money supply is the total amount of money in the economy. The central bank of the United States is the Federal Reserve. One of the tools the Fed has to help it achieve its monetary policy objectives is the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks must hold in their reserves.\nWhen the reserve ratio is increased, banks must hold more reserves. So, if the reserve ratio is increased, excess reserves in the banking system will increase.\nThe discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Fed. When the discount rate is increased, the cost of borrowing from the Fed goes up. This means that banks will be less likely to borrow from the Fed, and they will be more likely to lend their excess reserves to other banks.\nThe fed funds rate is the interest rate at which banks lend their excess reserves to other banks. When the discount rate is increased, the fed funds rate will usually increase.\nThe reserve ratio is not the only tool the Fed has to affect the money supply. The Fed can also change the target for the federal funds rate. For example, if the Fed wants to increase the money supply, it can lower the target for the federal funds rate. This target is not directly involved in determining the reserve ratio, but the two tools are related. When the target for the federal funds rate is lowered, the fed funds rate tends to decrease, and banks tend to have more excess reserves.\nSOLUTION: The reserve ratio is increased. When the reserve ratio is increased, banks must hold more reserves. If the total deposits in the banking system do not change, the excess reserves in the banking system will increase."}
{"question": "Which of the following statements is true of production possibility curves and trade between nations?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nations specialize and trade based on absolute advantage in production."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Free trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The flow of goods and services is based on the principle of absolute advantage."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nations can consume at points beyond the production possibility curve by protecting domestic industries from free trade."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Production possibility curves show the maximum quantity of two goods that a nation can produce. The curve is created by assuming that a nation has two resources, and each resource is either used to produce good X or good Y.\nIf a nation uses more of one resource and less of the other resource, it can produce more of good X or good Y. For example, a nation can produce more of good X by using more of the resource that is devoted to producing good X and less of the resource that is devoted to producing good Y.\nThe shape of the production possibility curve is determined by the resources a nation has. The curve is a downward-sloping straight line if the resources are equally suited to producing both goods. The curve is a upward-sloping straight line if the resources are more suited to producing one good. At each point on the curve, the nation can produce one of the goods, but not both.\nTrade allows nations to specialize in producing goods in which they have an advantage. A nation can produce both goods, even if it is not suited to producing both goods, by trading with other nations. For example, a nation with an advantage in producing good X can trade with a nation that has an advantage in producing good Y. The nation that has an advantage in producing good Y can then produce good Y, and the nation that has an advantage in producing good X can produce good X.\nBy trading, nations can consume goods that they do not produce. A nation can consume goods that it does not produce by trading with other nations. For example, a nation that produces only good X can trade with a nation that produces only good Y. The nation that produces only good Y can then produce good Y, and the nation that produces only good X can consume good Y.\nFree trade allows nations to trade with each other without barriers, such as tariffs or quotas. If trade is free, a nation can consume any good it wants by trading with other nations. For example, a nation can consume good X even if it does not produce good X. The nation can trade with another nation that produces good X.\nProtecting domestic industries from free trade by imposing barriers to trade can lead to inefficiencies. If a nation protects its domestic industries, it may produce some goods that consumers do not want to buy. Producing goods that consumers do not want to buy is inefficient. Consumers want to buy goods that make them better off. Producing goods that do not make consumers better off uses resources that could be used to produce goods that consumers want.\nSOLUTION: Production possibility curves and trade between nations are related. Nations can specialize in producing goods in which they have an advantage and trade with other nations to consume goods they do not produce. This specialization and trade allow nations to consume beyond their production possibility curves.\nNations do not produce beyond their production possibility curves. Producing beyond the production possibility curve is impossible. No matter how much a nation produces, it can never produce more than the sum of the resources it has."}

This can put a negative pressure on the economy.\nWhen the unemployment rate is low, it indicates that there are more jobs available than there are people out of work. This can put a positive pressure on the economy.\nSo, a decrease in the unemployment rate will likely result in economic growth.

They also believe that economic growth is the key to raising living standards.\nAccording to supply-side economists, high taxes on corporate profits can reduce the incentive for firms to invest in new plants, equipment, and other assets. As a result, high taxes on corporate profits can reduce the supply of goods and services and slow down economic growth.\nLower tax rates on interest earned from savings can increase the incentive to save. Savers tend to invest their savings in assets that can grow in value. As a result, lower tax rates on interest earned from savings can increase the supply of capital. An increase in capital can lead to increased investment in new plants, equipment, and other assets. An increase in investment can lead to increased productivity and higher income.\nRemoval of investment tax credits can decrease the incentive to invest in new plants, equipment, and other assets. Investment tax credits reduce the after-tax cost of investment. By decreasing the incentive to invest, removal of investment tax credits can reduce the supply of goods and services and slow down economic growth.\nA longer duration of unemployment benefits can reduce the incentive to look for a job. When people receive unemployment benefits for a longer time, they have less pressure to find a job. This can decrease the supply of labor. A decrease in the supply of labor can lead to decreased economic activity and income.\nSOLUTION: A longer duration of unemployment benefits is a policy that would increase the cost of unemployment. Higher costs of unemployment can reduce the incentive to look for a job. As a result, a longer duration of unemployment benefits can decrease the supply of labor and slow down economic growth.\nAccording to supply-side economists, a policy that would decrease the cost of producing goods and services would be better for promoting economic growth.

{"question": "Classical economists generally believe that I.   wages fluctuate quickly II.   Say's law does not hold III.   input and output prices will stay in line with each other IV.   the government should not worry about maintaining aggregate demand at an adequate level", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "II and IV only"}, {"label": "B", "text": "I III and IV only"}, {"label": "C", "text": "I and IV only"}, {"label": "D", "text": "II and III only"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Classical economists believe that markets are efficient and that the economy is self-regulating. They do not think that the government should interfere in the economy.\nSay's law is the idea that output prices include the cost of the inputs used to produce goods and services. So, if the price of a good or service rises, the price of its inputs will also rise. Say's law does not hold when there are significant costs associated with the distribution of goods and services.\nThere are several reasons why input and output prices may not always stay in line with each other. Deals for inputs are made at different times than deals for output. There are also transportation costs and other miscellaneous costs that may not be included in the input or output prices.\nDuring the short run, wages may fluctuate quickly. For example, workers who are in high demand can often command higher wages than workers who are in low demand.\nIn the long run, wages do not fluctuate quickly. Instead, changes in wages depend on changes in the supply and demand for labor. If wages rise, more people will choose to work. The supply of labor will go up, and wages will go down. If wages fall, fewer people will choose to work. The supply of labor will go down, and wages will go up.\nThe law of demand says that the quantity demanded of a good or service will go down when its price goes up. The law of supply says that the quantity supplied of a good or service will go up when its price goes up.\nWhen the government raises the minimum wage, the demand for labor will go up. The supply of labor will go down. The higher wages will also reduce the number of workers choosing to work. So, in the long run, the price of labor will go down.\nSOLUTION: Classical economists believe that wages fluctuate quickly. But Say's law does not hold. So, II and IV only are correct."}

When there is a high demand for a currency, its value will rise. When there is a low demand for a currency, its value will fall.\nThe demand for a currency is affected by its interest rate and by the inflation rate.\nHigh interest rates and high inflation rates will decrease the demand for a currency. So, in flexible currency markets, lower interest rates in the United States relative to China, or lower inflation rates in the United States relative to China will cause an appreciation of the dollar relative to the Chinese yuan.\nLower price levels in China relative to the United States will cause an appreciation of the dollar relative to the Chinese yuan. When the prices in China are lower, it will be advantageous for Chinese importers to buy dollars to make their purchases. This will increase the demand for dollars and cause its value to rise relative to the yuan.\nGrowing American preference to consume more Chinese-made goods will not cause an appreciation of the dollar relative to the Chinese yuan. This is because the demand for yuan will increase, which will cause the value of the yuan to rise relative to the dollar.\nRising per capita GDP in China increasing imports from the United States will not cause an appreciation of the dollar relative to the Chinese yuan. This is because the demand for dollars will increase, which will cause the value of the dollar to rise relative to the yuan."}

They can be caused by changes in consumer spending, changes in investment spending, and changes in government spending.\nWhen consumers spend more, businesses make more goods and services. Consumers spend more because they are confident about their financial future. Investment spending can also contribute to economic growth. When businesses invest in new equipment or buildings, they hire more workers to do the construction. This creates jobs, and the workers spend their earnings on goods and services. Government spending can also contribute to economic growth. When government spends more, it hires more workers or gives more money to other businesses. Both actions help economic growth.\nHowever, when consumers spend less, businesses make fewer goods and services. Consumers spend less because they are not confident about their financial future. Investment spending can also lead to economic downturns. When businesses cut back on investment spending, they lay off workers. This creates a ripple effect, as laid-off workers spend less. Government spending can also decrease. If government taxes more, that decreases spending. If government spends less, that also decreases spending."}
