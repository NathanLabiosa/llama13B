It contains the drives of the organism, such as the sex drive. The id operates on the pleasure principle, aiming to satisfy immediate needs.\nThe ego is the part of the personality that deals with reality. It mediates between the id and the superego. The ego is responsible for decision-making and for finding solutions to problems.\nThe superego is the part of the personality that includes the conscience. It contains the individual's sense of right and wrong. The superego develops from the moral and social rules of the individual's culture.\nThe Oedipus complex is a Freudian concept that refers to a sense of rivalry with one's father and a desire to supplant or marry one's mother. According to Freud, these feelings are important in the development of the superego.\nSOLUTION: In Freudian terms, the id was dominant. The id seeks immediate gratification, and Jacques' offer of a dairy treat satisfied a simple desire."}

For example, smoking during pregnancy is related to a higher risk of premature birth. Cocaine abuse during pregnancy is also related to a higher risk of premature birth. It is also related to an increased risk of low birth weight babies. Low birth weight means that the baby is born weighing less than 5-1/2 pounds. This can lead to serious health problems for the baby.\nSOLUTION: Cocaine abuse during pregnancy is related to an increased risk of low birth weight babies. Low birth weight is a risk factor for other health problems. It is also related to poorer growth and lower intelligence. Low birth weight babies may grow slowly and be less intelligent than babies who are not born weighing less than 5-1/2 pounds. Cocaine abuse during pregnancy is also related to smaller head circumference."}

One of his major ideas was the concept of psychosexual development. According to Freud, people go through five stages of psychosexual development. The nature of each stage is as follows:\n1. Oral stage: The infant gains pleasure by sucking. This stage begins around birth and ends around age 1.\n2. Anal stage: The infant gains pleasure by controlling their bowel movements. This stage begins around age 1 and ends around age 3.\n3. Phallic stage: The child gains pleasure by focusing on their genitals. This stage begins around age 3 and ends around age 6.\n4.

A fantasy involving a specific body part may be indicative of a body part fetish. A fantasy that is focused on activities that are not generally practiced may be indicative of a sexual sadism.\nA fantasy is not necessarily a reflection of a paraphilia if it is a harmless and common pattern of fantasy.

A patient may have one or more symptoms of a disease.\nFor example, consider a patient with the symptoms of fever and cough. These symptoms could be caused by either pneumonia or the flu. The patient might receive different treatments for each illness.\nSOLUTION: Premature delivery, spontaneous abortion, and tubal pregnancies are complications that can be caused by chlamydia.\nChlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease. It can cause infections in the reproductive system. In women, it can cause an infection of the cervix. In men, it can cause infections of the urethra or prostate gland.\nIf a woman has a chlamydia infection during pregnancy, it may cause complications. She may develop a fever or belly pain. If the infection is not treated, it may cause a premature birth. A premature birth is a birth that happens too early.\nIf a woman has a chlamydia infection when she is first pregnant, it may cause a spontaneous abortion. A spontaneous abortion happens on its own. It may be caused by a problem with the baby or the mother.\nIf a woman has a chlamydia infection during pregnancy, it may also cause a tubal pregnancy. A tubal pregnancy happens when a fertilized egg grows in a fallopian tube."}

This theory is based on the idea that certain traits, such as physical traits, are preferred in a mate. Over time, these preferred traits will evolve. Sexual selection may help explain gender differences that involve mate choice.\nAnother type of evolutionary theory is the social selection theory. This theory is based on the idea that certain traits, such as altruism, are advantageous in social situations. Over time, these advantageous traits will evolve.

The number of these chromosomes varies among animals. In humans, the X and Y chromosomes determine male and female sexuality.\nWomen have two X chromosomes, and men have an X and a Y chromosome. The Y chromosome contains genes that make men male.\nMen have a penis and have many more nerve endings in the penis than women have in the clitoris. Women have a clitoris, and men have a scrotum outside the body.\nThe external sexual organ in males is called the penis. It has three layers.\nThe first layer is called the root. The root of the penis is attached to the body.\nThe middle layer is called the shaft. The shaft is the longest part of the penis.\nThe third layer is called the head. The head is at the end of the penis.\nMales also have a urethra. The urethra carries urine and reproductive fluids from the penis.\nIn females, the external sexual organ is called the clitoris.

An extra copy of a chromosome can cause trisomy, a condition in which the baby has three copies of a chromosome instead of two. Down syndrome is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21.\nSome trisomies can be passed from parents to children. For example, trisomy 21 is present in about 1 in 800 births in the United States. It is caused by an error in cell division that occurs before fertilization.\nOther trisomies are caused by errors in cell division that occur after fertilization. These trisomies do not appear to be passed down through families.\nSOLUTION: Gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and genital herpes are sexually transmitted infections (STIs). They are not passed from mother to child through the placenta.\nBut a mother can pass an STI to her baby during childbirth. This is also known as birth with an STI.\nHow can a mother pass an STI to her baby during childbirth?\nDuring childbirth, a baby can come into contact with the mother's STI. This is most likely to happen if the mother has a herpes lesion (a sore) near the birth canal.\nA baby who comes into contact with an STI during childbirth can be affected by the infection.\nSOLUTION: Syphilis can be passed from mother to child through the placenta. The placenta is part of the fertilized egg that grows in the uterus during pregnancy. It provides food and oxygen to the baby and removes waste.\nIn the past, syphilis was called \"the great imitator\" because it often looked like other diseases. Today, we can easily diagnose syphilis. Syphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum.\nSOLUTION: Genital herpes cannot be passed from mother to child through the placenta.\nThe placenta provides food and oxygen to the baby and removes waste. But it does not allow fluids to pass through. So, the mother's genital herpes infection cannot be passed to her baby during pregnancy.\nChlamydia cannot be passed from mother to child through the placenta.\nChlamydia is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. It is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States."}

It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).\nThere are two types of HSV: HSV-1 and HSV-2.\nBoth types of HSV can cause sores on the genitals. But HSV-2 is usually the cause of sores on the buttocks and female genitalia. HSV-1 is usually the cause of sores on the male genitalia.\nA person can have HSV-1 or HSV-2 without any symptoms. But when symptoms do occur, they usually appear within 2 to 10 days after contact with the virus.\nThe first symptoms of genital herpes are often mistaken for another skin condition. They include:\nitching, pain, or discomfort in the genital area\nsmall red bumps that fill with fluid\nsores that break open and ooze fluid\npainful urination or bowel movements\nMost people will have these symptoms only once. After the first outbreak, the symptoms may go away completely. But the virus stays in the body. It may cause outbreaks again later.\nOutbreaks can be caused by stress, injury to the area, or illness. They may also happen without any obvious reason.\nGenital herpes is easier to diagnose and treat when symptoms are present. But it is still possible to have genital herpes even if you do not have any symptoms.\nIf you have genital herpes, you can take steps to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to someone else.

One question that sociobiologists can answer is why organisms have sex.\nSex is a behavior that involves a lot of costs and risks. For example, sex can be dangerous for both partners. It takes time and energy to find a mate and copulate, and it exposes the participants to disease.\nThere are also costs to offspring. Offspring must wait longer to be born than organisms that do not have sex. Offspring also face a greater risk of disease or death before birth.\nSome scientists argue that sex is important because it helps to maintain the double standard. According to this idea, men are expected to be more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, and women are expected to be more careful. This double standard can help men avoid the risks and costs of sex.\nOther scientists argue that sex is important because it helps to relieve tension. Having sex can be pleasurable, which may help to relieve stress.\nA third group of scientists argues that the main function of sex is to reproduce. According to this idea, sex helps to make new organisms that are identical to their parents.\nA fourth group of scientists argues that the main function of sex is to provide pleasure.

Inherited traits do not need to be learned.\nAcquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."}

As a result, changes in authors' attitudes and values can lead to changes in the portrayal of sexual behavior in their novels.\nFor example, in the 1950 s and 1960 s, many novelists began to challenge traditional attitudes toward sexual behavior.

In the 1970 s, novelists continued to explore sexual experiences, but readers were less open to these portrayals. By the 1980 s, readers had changed their attitudes back again. They were once again interested in reading about sexual experiences.\nSOLUTION: Premarital sex is sexual behavior that takes place before marriage. Extramarital sex is sexual behavior that takes place outside of marriage.\nOver the past several decades, attitudes toward premarital sex have become more accepting. But attitudes toward extramarital sex have become less accepting."}
