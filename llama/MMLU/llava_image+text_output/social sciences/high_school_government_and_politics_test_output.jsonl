These rules and doctrines affect which provisions of the Constitution are applicable in particular cases.\nOne such rule is that the Constitution is a written document that does not explicitly answer many important questions. In particular, the Constitution does not answer questions about how judges should apply its general provisions.\nIn such cases, judges look to the Constitution's structure. The Constitution's structure consists of its fundamental rules and principles, as well as its provisions for interpreting and applying those rules and principles.\nOne of the Constitution's fundamental principles is federalism, which means that power is divided between different levels of government. Another fundamental principle is the separation of powers, which means that the government is divided into three branches.\nThe Constitution's provisions for interpreting and applying its principles include the principle of judicial review, which means that judges have the final say in interpreting the Constitution.\nSOLUTION: The Supreme Court has struck a balance between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause by holding that the First Amendment's prohibition on the establishment of religion by law means that the government cannot show preferential treatment to one religion over another. The government is thus prevented from looking as if it is partially sponsoring or promoting religion.\nThe government may not require attendance at religious ceremonies or training, but it may provide religious instruction in public schools, as long as the instruction is evenhanded and does not overtly proselytize.\nCongress can appropriate tax money to pay for instruction in the history of religious faiths, but not for instruction in the doctrines of any particular faith.\nThe government may not discriminate among individuals on the basis of their religious beliefs.\nThe government may not restrict expression of religious beliefs or practices, as long as these do not harm others."}

How do television network news shows decide what to cover? The following excerpt from the book News and Society explains the role of news criteria in news selection.\nNews criteria are the guidelines that journalists use to decide what is important. They also tell journalists what to look for, where to find it, and how to write about it. News criteria can include professional norms and values, such as objectivity and timeliness, as well as the practical realities of news gathering and production, such as access to sources and the need to present complex information in a simple way.\nNews criteria change over time. Different criteria come to the fore at different stages of a campaign. For example, during the primary season, news outlets might use criteria such as the number of voters each candidate has won and the amount of money each candidate has raised. Later in the general election season, news outlets might use criteria such as the candidates' positions on issues and their personal traits.\nBecause news criteria change over time, news coverage of a campaign will change. This is true even for television network news shows, which are often seen as the most traditional and conservative part of the news media.\nSOLUTION: For voters who rely exclusively on television network news coverage of national elections, the criteria used by journalists to decide what to cover most heavily influence what these voters are aware of.\nThe excerpt above indicates that criteria such as public opinion polls and the relative strength of each candidate's support are most important for these voters. Thus, these voters are most likely to be aware of which special interest groups have endorsed which candidates, and candidates' positions on international issues, domestic issues, and the like will be less important to them."}

Instead, the Constitution tries to figure out how to make as many people as possible happy with the government.\nThe system of government created by the Constitution is called federalism. Federalism is a system in which the government is divided into parts. Those parts are called branches. The branches do different things.

An appellate court hears appeals. A trial court tries cases.\nThe judge or jury in a trial court makes decisions of fact. A trial court may also make conclusions of law. But an appellate court only reviews the decisions of a lower court. An appellate court does not decide new facts. It does not have a jury.\nSo, appellate judges review decisions of lower courts. And appellate trials are usually not trials in the usual sense."}

This lecture explains why.\nThe presidency's power and prestige have grown in part because of the expansion of the federal government's responsibilities. As the government has become more involved in matters such as economic regulation, environmental protection, and social welfare, the president's role as chief executive has expanded.\nThe development of mass media has also increased the power and prestige of the presidency. The growth of radio and television has made it possible for presidents to speak directly to the American people.\nFinally, the prestige of the presidency has grown in part because of the important role the presidency has played in times of crisis."}

An interest group is an organization that has an economic or social interest in government policy. These groups attempt to influence public policy by lobbying (or pressuring) legislators to adopt their positions.\nThe media and the public often criticize interest groups for being overly concerned with their own interests and for distorting the political process. However, interest groups argue that they add value to the political process by providing information and expertise that legislators might not have.\nAn interest group's constituents are the people or businesses that are affected by the group's issues. An interest group's income is determined by the number of its constituents and the size of donations from its constituents.\nAn interest group's effectiveness is a function of its income, its political orientation (or stance on issues), and the size of the group's bureaucracy.\nSOLUTION: The reason interest groups representing businesspeople and investors are often among the most successful lobbying groups in Washington, D.C., is that they have the financial resources to mount sustained campaigns on their own behalf.\nSuch groups have the resources to donate large sums of money to political campaigns. In the 2014 midterm elections, for example, 85% of the money from donors giving more than $500 went to Republican candidates. This large pool of money gives these business-oriented groups a significant amount of influence."}

It describes the structure and powers of the central government and is one of the country's founding documents.\nThe Constitution is a brief document, but it is the foundation of the nation's government. Its principles have been influential worldwide.\nThe Constitution's principles, or rules, are just as important as its laws. The principles provide the structure for the laws. The principles are the guideposts that judges use to interpret the laws.\nSome of the main principles of the Constitution are described below.\nChecks and balances: The Constitution provides that each branch of the federal government has some control over the other branches. This principle helps to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.\nEqual representation: The Constitution requires that the Senate have two senators from each state. This principle means that each state has the same influence in the Senate.\nRepresentative government: The Constitution provides for a system of government in which elected officials represent the people.\nSeparation of powers: The Constitution assigns the powers of the federal government to three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. This principle prevents any one branch from having too much power.\nUnitary government: The Constitution does not call for a unitary government. A unitary government is when the central government has all the power.\nDirect democracy: The Constitution does not describe a system of direct democracy. In a system of direct democracy, citizens vote directly on laws and rules.\nSOLUTION: The Constitution describes a system of representative government. It does not describe a system of direct democracy. So, direct democracy does not describe a core principle of the Constitution as it was written in 1787.\nThe Constitution describes a system of checks and balances. It does not describe a system of unitary government. So, unitary government does not describe a core principle of the Constitution as it was written in 1787.\nThe Constitution does not use the words equal representation. But the Constitution does require that the Senate have two senators from each state. This principle means that each state has the same influence in the Senate.\nSeparation of powers is a core principle of the Constitution as it was written in 1787. The Constitution assigns the powers of the federal government to three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial."}

Not all bills are considered by committees, and not all bills get a vote on the House or Senate floor. In the past, some legislation has not been considered by Congress at all. These bills are said to have died in committee or to have been \"filibustered\" in the Senate.\nIn 2009, the Senate modified its rules to include a provision known as the nuclear option. This change makes it possible for the Senate to change its rules and overcome a filibuster with a simple majority vote.\nPrior to the nuclear option, a supermajority (usually 60 senators) was required to overcome a filibuster. The table below shows how the rules of the Senate have changed over the years.\nYear | Rules\n1830 | The Senate decides its rules at the beginning of each session.\n1875 | Changes to the rules require a two-thirds majority.\n1917 | A filibuster is defined as a senator talking for a certain amount of time.\n1975 | The threshhold for closing debate is lowered to 60 votes.\n2003 | The Senate changes its rules to make it easier to change them later.\n2009 | The nuclear option is declared unconstitutional.\n2013 | The nuclear option is exercised, and the threshhold for ending a filibuster is lowered to 51 votes.\nSOLUTION: The elastic clause is the last clause in the United States Constitution. It is also known as the supremacy clause. It states that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.\nThe elastic clause also gives the federal government the power to preempt, or override, state laws. This is because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.\nWhen a federal law contradicts a state law, the federal law takes precedence, or comes first. The federal law is considered the supreme law."}

{"question": "Which of the following best predicts how someone will vote in an election?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The voter's gender"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The voter's political party affiliation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The voter's socioeconomic status"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The voter's religion"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In order to make predictions, you need to identify patterns in data. If two variables are correlated, it means that changing one variable tends to be associated with changes in the other variable. For example, height and weight are correlated: as one increases, the other tends to increase.\nHowever, just because two variables are correlated, it doesn't mean that one variable predicts the other. For a variable to predict another variable, the relationship between them must be causative. That is, the variable that is predicting the other variable must cause the other variable to change.\nFor example, consider the variables height and weight. Height predicts weight because as height increases, weight tends to increase. This is because height and weight are both affected by malnourishment or obesity.\nOn the other hand, consider the variables height and age. Age does not predict height because age does not affect height.\nSOLUTION: The best predictor of how someone will vote is the voter's political party affiliation. Political party affiliation is a strong predictor of voting behavior.\nSocial scientists have many methods for measuring socioeconomic status, such as education level, income, and occupation. One common method is to use household income.\nGender and religion do not necessarily predict voting behavior. For example, men and women vote differently in some elections, but women do not always vote one way and men the other. Similarly, some religious people vote one way on religious issues and the opposite way on non-religious issues."}

Whether that advantage is greater for members of the House of Representatives or the Senate depends on which aspect of incumbency is the greatest advantage.\nIncumbents have an advantage because they can use their office to publicize their achievements and gain an advantage over challengers. This advantage is greater for senators, who have more political power and a longer term in office to accomplish more.\nSo, senators have more political power than representatives, and Senate races are accordingly more competitive.\nHowever, representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents. This publicity can help incumbents get reelected.\nRepresentatives also have the advantage of having more uncontested races. In an uncontested race, the incumbent runs unopposed. Because the incumbent has a well-known record, he or she has an advantage over a challenger.\nSo, representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents, and they also have the advantage of having more uncontested races."}

In other words, the Court has moved from being a court of judicial restraint to being a court of judicial activism.\nJudicial restraint involves a judge deferring to the decisions of elected officials. A judge who is restrained will strike down a law only if the law violates the Constitution.\nJudicial activism involves a judge making policy decisions instead of only interpreting the Constitution. A judge who is activist will strike down a law if the lawyer argues that the law is unconstitutional, even if the law is not unconstitutional.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is judicial activism. A Supreme Court that is engaged in judicial activism is willing to change public policy and alter judicial precedent.\nDue process is the idea that the government must respect all of its citizens' rights. The Constitution includes several due process clauses. One due process clause requires that the government follow certain procedures when it harms people. The others require that the government treat all people equally.\nEx post facto lawmaking is when a law is retroactively applied. This means that the law is made after the fact, and it punishes people for actions that were legal when they were taken. In other words, an ex post facto law changes the legal consequences of an event after the event has occurred."}

The nine justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life. The position of a Supreme Court justice is very important, as the justices interpret the laws and define the limits of the federal government's power.\nThere have been times when a president has tried to appoint a Supreme Court justice, but the nomination has not been confirmed by the Senate. When this happens, the president's influence over the Supreme Court is temporarily limited.\nThere have also been times when a sitting Supreme Court justice has faced impeachment proceedings. Impeachment is the process of charging a government official with an offense. In the United States, a government official can be impeached if he or she commits \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" An impeached official is not automatically removed from office. An impeached official is acquitted if the Senate does not convict the official. A conviction by the Senate occurs if at least two-thirds of the senators vote to convict the official.\nThere have been no impeachments of Supreme Court justices. But there have been impeachments of other government officials.\nThe impeachment proceedings are an example of a coalition building. Opposition to a president's Supreme Court nomination is an example of realignment.\nA recall election is not a possibility for a Supreme Court justice.

The government can use this power to raise money for public purposes. One way it does this is by levying taxes on goods and services. The government can also use its taxing power to raise money for private purposes. For example, the government can tax people to build a highway. Such a tax is called a privilege tax. The government can grant a privilege, such as driving on a highway, and then tax people for the privilege of engaging in the activity.\nMembers of Congress are allowed to mail letters to their constituents at the government's expense because of the franking privilege. The franking privilege is the right of a member of Congress to send official mail to his or her constituents at government expense. The use of the privilege is not subject to review by the government.\nPork-barrel legislation is bills that allocate federal funds for projects that are intended to benefit constituents of a particular member of Congress. The purpose of pork-barrel legislation is to help members of Congress get re-elected. By bringing money into their districts, they can demonstrate their power to take care of their constituents.\nGerrymandering is the process of redrawing the boundaries of electoral districts. Gerrymandering can help the majority party in a state draw districts in a way that gives them an advantage. For example, the majority party might draw a district that is shaped like a weird shape, or \"gerrymander,\" in order to include more voters who are likely to support the party.\nThe Sixteenth Amendment is the constitutional amendment that authorizes the government to levy an income tax. The income tax is a tax on people's earnings. The amendment was adopted in 1913."}

This process is known as redistricting.\nRedistricting is important because it affects the outcome of elections. By drawing district boundaries, state legislatures can make it more difficult for some voters to vote for their preferred candidate. For example, state legislatures could draw district boundaries to pack as many voters as possible from a particular political party into a small number of districts. This would make it more difficult for that party's candidates to win elections in the other districts."}

The merit-based civil service has replaced the spoils system.\nThe spoils system was a system in which civil service jobs were awarded to political supporters.

These branches are independent and have their own jobs. This system is called a separation of powers.\nOne part of the separation of powers is the concept of checks and balances. The three branches can check and balance each other. No one branch has too much power.\nIn the judicial branch, the Constitutional Convention. The Constitutional Convention took place in 1787. It was a meeting of the best minds in the country. Their goal was to fix the weak parts of the Articles of Confederation. The Articles of Confederation was the first Constitution. It was in place during the time of the American Revolution.\nOne of the problems with the Articles of Confederation was that there was no strong central government. So, when the United States won the revolution, it had no way to enforce its laws. The Constitutional Convention was asked to fix this problem.\nThe Constitutional Convention came up with a solution. They created a strong central government. But to make sure that the central government did not become too powerful, they also included several safeguards. These safeguards are called constitutional principles.\nOne of the constitutional principles is the separation of powers. The separation of powers means that the three branches of the government are independent and have their own jobs. This keeps any one branch from having too much power.\nAnother constitutional principle is checks and balances. Checks and balances mean that each branch of the government can check the actions of the other branches. This keeps any one branch from becoming too powerful.\nA third constitutional principle is jurisdiction. Jurisdiction means that each branch of the government has its own area of responsibility. This keeps any one branch from encroaching, or getting involved, in the work of the other branches.\nSOLUTION: The Constitution does not give the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the power to issue, enforce, and adjudicate all disputes regarding a new regulation. The Constitution does not give the EPA any judicial power. The EPA can issue and enforce regulations. But the EPA cannot adjudicate, or judge, disputes that arise from its regulations."}

It refers to the ways in which the three branches of the federal government are separate and equal. The president, the Senate, and the House of Representatives each do different jobs. This system keeps any one part of the government from having too much power.\nThe president is the head of the executive branch. He or she makes laws, known as executive orders, and carries out laws.\nThe Senate is one of the two parts of the legislative branch. It represents the states. Each state has two senators.\nThe House of Representatives is the other part of the legislative branch. It has more members than the Senate. The House represents the people.\nThe president can veto, or reject, a law. A law cannot become a federal law if the president vetoes it. But Congress can override a presidential veto. If most members of the Senate and the House of Representatives vote to pass the law again, the law can become a federal law even if the president does not want it to.\nCongress can override a presidential veto by passing the law again. This time, the law must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Two-thirds of the Senate means at least 67 senators. Two-thirds of the House of Representatives means at least 290 representatives.\nThe president's nominees must be approved by the Senate before taking office.

However, states are allowed to impose additional safety regulations.\nSOLUTION: Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets is an example of devolution. The national government has the power to regulate pollution that crosses state lines. However, it has devolved some of its powers to the states by allowing states to decide how to meet federal emission standards.\nA \"race to the bottom\" in which states compete with one another to have the fewest environmental regulations is not an example of devolution. In this case, states are not being given the power to regulate. Instead, states are being allowed to reduce the stringency of their regulations.\nA state that legalizes marijuana possession in conflict with federal law is not an example of devolution. In this case, the state is not being given the power to regulate. Instead, the state is choosing to disregard a federal law.\nA state being prevented from implementing a fuel efficiency standard that is more stringent than that set by the federal government is not an example of devolution. In this case, the state is not being given the power to regulate. Instead, the state is being prevented from implementing a regulation that is more strict than the federal regulation."}

There are many committees in the House of Representatives.\nThe House has 19 standing committees. These are permanent committees that deal with different issues. There are also special committees that are created to deal with specific problems.\nSome committees are assigned specific responsibilities. For example, the Ethics Committee is in charge of investigating ethical misconduct by members of Congress. The Rules Committee is in charge of rules for bills and debates.\nThe chairs of the committees are Congress members. They are in charge of the committees.\nThere are also ranking members.

They are not allowed.\nA bill of attainder is a legislative act that identifies a person or group as guilty of a crime or misdemeanor and sets out the punishment. Bills of attainder can be used to punish a specific individual or group without the benefits of a trial.\nThe U.S. Constitution forbids bills of attainder. The Constitution says that the government cannot use a bill of attainder to punish an individual. It also says that the government cannot use a bill of attainder to confiscate or destroy an individual's property.\nAffirmative action programs are not bills of attainder. An affirmative action program does not punish an individual or group. Instead, an affirmative action program gives a preferential treatment to members of a group that has been historically disadvantaged.\nSocial Security benefits are not bills of attainder. Social Security benefits are not punishments. They are a type of government benefit.\nThe New Federalism is a policy that promotes greater local control and decision-making. The New Federalism does not promote preferential treatment for members of groups that have historically suffered from discrimination."}

The four parts of the Constitution are the Preamble, the Articles, the Amendments, and the Statutes.\nThe Preamble sets forth the Constitution's fundamental purposes.\nThe seven Articles frame the structure of the Constitution.\nThe first ten Amendments are the Bill of Rights.\nThe remaining Amendments address issues such as the powers of the federal government, the relationship between the states and the federal government, and the rights of citizens.\nThe Statutes are the laws that Congress has passed under the powers granted to it by the Constitution.\nSOLUTION: A constitutional amendment to the contrary of a court decision (A) is a lawful way to limit the influence of the federal courts. A constitutional amendment can override a court decision the way the 16 th Amendment overrode the 1895 court decision in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. The court decision in Pollock had declared a federal income tax unconstitutional.\nThe impeachment of a federal judge (B) is a lawful way to remove a federal judge from the bench. But impeachment does not limit the influence of the federal courts. A impeachment can remove a federal judge from the bench, but the federal courts will still exist.\nA governor's failure to enforce a court decision (C) is not a lawful way to limit the influence of the federal courts. Governors can enforce court decisions, but they cannot stop court decisions from being enforced.\nA national election recalling an unpopular judge (D) is not a lawful way to limit the influence of the federal courts. No national election can change the text of the Constitution. The Constitution's text can only be changed by a lawful amendment."}

These groups are often defined by law.\nCongress must pay benefits to anyone who qualifies to receive them. If the government has money in a trust fund set up for a specific program, then Congress must pay benefits from that fund.\nCongress is allowed to fund these programs only when the federal government has a budget surplus. A budget surplus means that the government has more money coming in than it has to pay out.\n Congress grants money to states, provided that certain criteria are met. These criteria often include rules about how the states must spend the money.\n Congress provides funds to the states, and the states decide how best to spend the money. The federal government requires the states to spend the money on certain types of programs, but the states have some flexibility in how they spend the money."}

These works influenced the colonial patriots' thinking about government and liberty.\nThomas Hobbes believed that life was always short, brutish, and nasty. He thought that people were always fighting and competing with each other. Hobbes did not believe that people were equal. Instead, he believed that some people were natural leaders, and that others were natural followers. Hobbes thought that the best government was a strong authoritarian government.\nNiccolo Macchiavelli believed that people were often selfish and acted without thinking about the long-term consequences. He believed that the best government was a strong government that would do whatever was necessary to maintain its power.\nJohn Locke believed that people were born with natural rights to life, liberty, and property. He believed that the purpose of government was to protect people's natural rights. According to Locke, people could give up their natural rights when they agreed to join a government. But they could also take them back if the government did not protect them.\nJonathan Edwards preached that people were born with a sense of right and wrong. He believed that government should enforce people's sense of right and wrong. Edwards believed that when people broke the rules, they should be punished."}

If Congress has a constitutional power to regulate an area, it may also have the power of oversight over the executive branch's implementation of that area. For example, if Congress has the power to regulate education, it may have the power of oversight over the Department of Education.\nThe committee and subcommittee structures of Congress are a few of the ways in which Congress exercises its power of oversight. Each house of Congress has committees and subcommittees with jurisdiction over different areas of policy. When a committee or subcommittee is considering a bill or an administrative action, it may hold hearings, gather information, and interview officials and interested parties.\nIn addition to its power of oversight, Congress has other ways to oversee the executive branch. These include hearing witnesses' testimony, holding the president and other officials in contempt, and impeaching and removing the president or other officials from office."}

These laws ensure that voters who have a language difficulty, live overseas, or have disabilities can participate. They also ensure that voters are not discouraged from voting by long waits or confusing ballots.\nBallots in Native Language\nFederal election laws require that, in an area that has a substantial community of non-English speakers, voters be provided with ballots in their native language. This requirement applies to areas with at least 10,000 voters who are not proficient in English.\nThere are 30 different languages spoken in the United States. The following are some of the ways that states provide language assistance:\nAlaska: Translated ballots are provided in languages other than English.\nCalifornia: The state provides voter guides in 11 different languages.\nFlorida: Bilingual ballots are provided in counties where at least 20,000 voters are not proficient in English.\nNew York: Bilingual ballots are provided in counties with at least 30,000 voters who are not proficient in English.\nNorth Carolina: Interpreters are available in counties with at least 2,500 voters who are not proficient in English.\nTexas: Translated ballots are provided in counties with at least 10,000 voters who are not proficient in English.\nVirginia: Bilingual ballots are provided in precincts where at least 10,000 voters are not proficient in English.\nLonger Polling Hours\nFederal election laws do not require that polling places be open for longer than the typical work day.\nPolling places are typically open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Some states allow polling places to remain open later. For example, Texas allows polling places to remain open until 8:30 p.m.\nTax for Elections\nFederal election laws do not require that a tax be collected from each voter to pay for the cost of the election.\nThe United States uses a system of free elections. The cost of an election is paid for by the federal government.\nGuaranteeing Representation\nFederal election laws do not require that congressional district lines be drawn to guarantee that at least one elected congressperson be of a racial minority.\nThe United States Constitution requires that each state be allowed to decide how to draw congressional district lines. No federal law requires that district lines be drawn to benefit a racial minority."}
