The formula for cross-price elasticity is:\nThe sign of the cross-price elasticity is important.\nIf the cross-price elasticity is positive, the goods are complementary. When the price of one good falls, the quantity demanded of the other good increases.\nIf the cross-price elasticity is negative, the goods are substitutes. When the price of one good falls, the quantity demanded of the other good falls.\nIf the cross-price elasticity is zero, the goods are independent.

In reality, most markets are imperfect competitors.\nA monopoly is a market with one seller. Since there is no other seller, the monopoly has a captive market. It can sell for a higher price than a perfect competitor because it has no close rivals. But a monopoly produces less output.\nA perfect competitor is a market with many sellers. Each seller is so small that it has no effect on the price. Each seller charges the market price, which is the price that clears the market. Because there are many sellers, no single seller can charge a much higher price. So, a perfect competitor produces more output and sells for a lower price than a monopoly.\nSOLUTION: A monopoly produces less output and sells for a higher price.\nA monopoly charges a higher price because it has no close rivals. It produces less output because it knows that it can charge a higher price.\nA perfect competitor breaks even in the short run and the monopoly does not. In the long run, both the monopoly and the perfect competitor break even. But in the short run, the perfect competitor does not make a profit, and the monopoly does."}
{"question": "In the design of a competitive market system, which of the following does NOT describe how resources are allocated?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Price signals that guide producers on what, when, how, and for whom to produce goods and services."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Active government ownership and direction of production."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Voluntary market exchange between buyers and sellers."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Distribution of income and goods on the basis of contribution or productivity."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In a market economy, institutions such as prices, property rights, and contracting mechanisms are used to coordinate the actions of households and firms. In the absence of market institutions, what would a resource allocator do?\nThe only way to answer this question is to look at the nature of the institution.\nWhen property rights are well-defined, a resource allocator can use market exchange to efficiently allocate resources. Property rights define the right to use or transfer resources. When property rights are well-defined, it means that the resource owner has the right to decide how the resource is used or to whom it is transferred.\nWhen property rights are not well-defined, a resource allocator may use non-market exchange. Non-market exchange is the exchange of goods or services that is not bought or sold. For example, people often share food, shelter, or time with each other without charging money.\nWhen property rights are not well-defined, the resource allocator may also use violence. Violence involves the use of physical force or the threat of physical force. For example, a landlord may use violence to evict a tenant or a government may use violence to collect taxes.\nSOLUTION: Active government ownership and direction of production is when the government uses violence to allocate resources. The government tells firms what to produce, how to produce it, and to whom they should sell it.\nVoluntary market exchange between buyers and sellers is when the government does not tell firms what to produce or how to produce it. The government also does not tell buyers what to buy or sellers what to sell. Instead, buyers and sellers decide what to produce, how to produce it, and to whom they should sell it.\nPrice signals that guide producers on what, when, how, and for whom to produce goods and services. When the price of a good or service changes, it sends a signal to producers. The signal tells producers what, when, how, and for whom to produce goods or services.\nDistribution of income and goods on the basis of contribution or productivity. The distribution of income and goods refers to how resources are distributed. Contribution or productivity refers to how much a person contributes or produces. In a market economy, resources are distributed based on contribution or productivity. People get paid based on how much they contribute or produce."}

The market for a variable resource is the set of all buyers who are potential customers for the resource. For example, the market for labor is all the businesses and other organizations that buy labor.\nWhen the per unit price of a variable resource rises, it causes an upward shift of the resource's market. This shift indicates that buyers are willing to pay higher prices for the resource.\nWhen the per unit price of a variable resource falls, it causes a downward shift of the resource's market. This shift indicates that buyers are no longer willing to pay as high prices for the resource.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the per unit price of labor shifts the market for labor upward. This upward shift indicates that buyers are willing to pay higher prices for labor. So, the increase in the per unit price of labor causes an upward shift of AFC.\nAn increase in the per unit price of labor does not directly affect the price at which goods are sold. So, it does not directly affect the MC or MPL of the goods.\nThe upward shift of AFC caused by the increase in the per unit price of labor does not directly change the number of workers or the amount of capital needed to produce goods.

For firms with variable costs, that price is the minimum of the average total cost and the marginal cost. For firms with fixed costs, the price is the minimum of the average total cost and the average variable cost.\nBecause total cost is made up of both fixed cost and variable cost, the average total cost and average variable cost are always less than the total cost.\nFor firms with variable costs, the total cost is the same as the average total cost.\nFor firms with fixed costs, the total cost is the same as the average variable cost.\nJason's total variable cost is $80, and his total fixed cost is $20. So, his average total cost is $60, and his average variable cost is $40.\nThe price Jason should charge for each pool is the minimum of $60 and $40.

DVDs are a price elastic good."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The income elasticity of demand for a good or service is a measure of how responsive consumption of the good or service is to a change in income.\nAn income elasticity of +1.5 means that consumption of the good increases by 15 percent when income increases by 10 percent. So, a 10 percent increase in income produces a 15 percent increase in consumption of the good.\nAn income elasticity of -1.5 means that consumption of the good decreases by 15 percent when income decreases by 10 percent. So, a 10 percent increase in the price of the good produces a 15 percent decrease in consumption of the good.\nA good is normal when its income elasticity is between +1 and -1. A good is a luxury good when its income elasticity is positive and greater than +1. A good is an inferior good when its income elasticity is negative and less than -1.\nA good is price elastic when its income elasticity is greater than the price elasticity of demand. A good is price inelastic when its income elasticity is less than the price elasticity of demand.\nSOLUTION: A DVD is a normal luxury good.

{"question": "If the price of a product decreases with the price of a substitute product remaining constant such that the consumer buys more of this product, this is called the", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "income effect."}, {"label": "B", "text": "substitution effect."}, {"label": "C", "text": "marginal effect."}, {"label": "D", "text": "supply effect."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The price of a product is the amount of money that consumers pay for it. There are several things that can make the price of a product change.\nThe substitute effect happens when the price of a substitute product changes. A substitute is a product that can be used in place of another product. For example, if the price of coffee changes, the amount of coffee that consumers decide to buy may change. But if the price of tea changes, the amount of tea consumers decide to buy will not.\nThe income effect happens when the price of a product changes and the consumer's income stays the same. The income effect is opposite to the substitution effect. If the price of a product goes down, the consumer will buy more of it. But the consumer will not buy more of a expensive substitute.\nThe marginal effect is the sum of the substitute effect and the income effect.\nThe supply effect happens when the price of a product changes. The supply effect is opposite to the demand effect. If the price of a product goes up, the quantity of the product that consumers want to buy will go down. But the quantity of the product that producers want to sell will go up.\nSOLUTION: If the price of a product decreases with the price of a substitute product remaining constant, the substitute effect is the consumer's response to the change in price. The substitute effect is the effect of the change in price of a substitute product.\nThe change in the price of the product makes the consumer decide to buy more of the product.

Total utility is the sum of the values of all the units of a good that you consume. Marginal utility is the change in total utility when you consume one more unit of the good.\nThe marginal utility of a good tends to be highest when you first start consuming the good. As you consume more of the good, the marginal utility tends to decrease.\nUtility is a subjective measure. It depends on your personal preferences. Two people can have different utilities for the same good.\nSOLUTION: The best answer is D.\nWhen you consume air, you gain a benefit with the largest possible total utility. You breathe in air, and that gives you life.\nThe marginal utility of air is zero. If you have air, you have life. If you don't have air, you don't have life.\nSo, air provides both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility."}

When externalities are present, they can sometimes lead to too much or too little of something being produced or consumed.\nExternalities can be classified as either positive or negative. A positive externality is a benefit that is shared by others. A negative externality is a cost that is shared by others.\nWhen externalities are present, they can be corrected in two ways:\n1. Government taxes or subsidies: When there is a negative externality, the government can tax the producer and use the revenue to subsidize the victim. For example, the government can tax coal producers and subsidize coal miners. When there is a positive externality, the government can subsidize the producer and use the revenue to tax the victims. For example, the government can subsidize solar power producers and tax the beneficiaries of solar power.\n2. The price: The price can also internalize externalities. When there is a negative externality, the producer pays the external cost in the form of lower prices. When there is a positive externality, the producer receives the external benefit in the form of higher prices.\nSOLUTION: A negative externality has a cost that is shared by others. The cost of the externality is not reflected in the price. To internalize the externality, the price must increase. A government tax on the producer can increase the price.\nA government subsidy would not increase the price. A subsidy lowers the price.\nA lower price would not increase the price. A lower price is caused by a lower cost of production.\nA higher level of output would not increase the price. The externality remains after the output is increased."}

If price is equal to marginal cost, then the monopoly is charging exactly what the product is worth. If price is equal to average cost, then the monopoly is charging more than the product is worth.\nA perfectly elastic demand curve means that the price of the product is equal to the marginal cost of producing the product. In other words, the buyers are so sensitive to price that they will stop buying the product if the price goes up by even a small amount. The demand curve is flat.\nWeak barriers to entry mean that there are some small firms in the industry, but one or two dominant firms will quickly emerge.

Consumer surplus is the value of a good or service to a consumer beyond the price the consumer pays. Producer surplus is the value of a good or service to a producer beyond the price the producer receives.\nFor consumers, a lower price for a good or service than before tends to increase the consumer surplus. For producers, a higher price for a good or service than before tends to increase the producer surplus.\nThere are many other ways in which prices can change. For example, prices can go up or down because of changes in the cost of production, changes in demand, or changes in available supplies.\nWhen prices go up, consumer surplus goes down. And when prices go down, consumer surplus goes up.\nSOLUTION: The best way to increase consumer surplus is to lower the price of tickets.\nThe Reds must increase ticket prices to afford the most talented players.\nThis increase in ticket prices will decrease consumer surplus.\nThe city of Cincinnati is undertaking a huge highway construction project that strands fans in pregame traffic jams for hours.\nThis event would decrease consumer surplus. Fans would have to spend more time getting to the game and less time enjoying it.\nThe Reds offer discounted parking for all home games.\nThis event would increase consumer surplus. It would cost the Reds less to provide parking, and they could pass that savings on to fans.\nThe Reds increase hot dog prices to reflect a higher cost of buns.\nThis event would not increase consumer surplus. The price of hot dogs would go up, but the price increase would not reflect a change in the cost of producing the hot dogs."}

The industry price will be set where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.\nIn an oligopoly, a market with a few sellers, each seller may attempt to be a monopolist within the oligopoly. That is, each seller tries to produce where its marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. If one seller succeeds in being a monopolist, other sellers will follow, and the oligopoly will become a monopoly.\nIn a monopoly, there is one seller of a good or service.

It has the market all to itself.\nMonopolies can make a lot of money. They can charge high prices and still sell a lot of goods and services because they are the only game in town.\nHowever, monopolies can also be a problem. They can charge high prices and reduce the amount sold. This is because the monopoly is trying to charge a price that maximizes its profit. But by charging a high price, the monopoly reduces the quantity sold. Since the monopoly is the only supplier, it doesn't care. The consumers have no place else to go.\nSo, monopolies are allowed to charge higher prices but are required to charge no more than what they would charge in a non-discriminatory monopoly. A non-discriminatory monopoly is a monopoly that charges the highest price it can while still selling the most goods and services.\nPrice discrimination happens when a firm charges different prices to different customers for the same good or service. A price-discriminating monopoly is a monopoly that charges different prices to different customers.\nA price-discriminating monopoly can earn more revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly. It can charge a higher price to at least one customer. But a price-discriminating monopoly also has a more elastic demand curve than a non-discriminating monopoly. This means that the price-discriminating monopoly will produce less than a non-discriminating monopoly.\nSOLUTION: A price-discriminating monopoly has a demand curve that is more elastic than a non-discriminating monopoly. So, the price-discriminating monopoly will produce less than a non-discriminating monopoly.\nSince the price-discriminating monopoly will produce less, it will earn less revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly."}

Marginal utility is the change in total utility when the quantity of a good consumed changes by one unit.\nFor example, if the marginal utility of an ice cream sundae is 100 units, and the consumer eats two sundaes, the marginal utility of the second sundae is 100 units. However, the total utility of the two sundaes is twice as high as the total utility of one sundae.\nSo, the total utility stays the same with each additional unit consumed. But the marginal utility decreases with each additional unit consumed.\nSOLUTION: When you consume more of a good, the marginal utility of that good tends to decrease. So, marginal utility decreases with each additional unit of a good that is consumed.\nIn addition, total utility also decreases when you consume more of a good. While each unit of the good has a lower marginal utility, each unit is also more expensive. So, the total utility of the good tends to decrease as you consume more of it."}

There are several things that can make the demand curve drop, or slope down. One of these is the law of diminishing marginal returns to production.\nWhen a producer increases the amount of a good or service that it produces, the law of diminishing marginal returns to production states that the additional cost of producing one more item will eventually increase. This means that the marginal cost of the item will go up.\nWhen the marginal cost of a good or service goes up, the price that consumers are willing to pay will often go up, but not by as much. As a result of this change in price and quantity demanded, the demand curve will slope down.\nSOLUTION: The law of diminishing marginal returns to production tells you that as a producer expands its production, the marginal cost of production will increase. This means that the demand curve will slope down."}

When the price of a good or service is kept above the market equilibrium price, the quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied.\nThere are several reasons the government might choose to set a price floor. One reason is that the government might want to keep the price below the market equilibrium price. For example, the government might want to subsidize the price of a beneficial good, such as ethanol. Another reason is that the government might want to discourage the consumption of a harmful good, such as cigarettes.\nA price floor will usually be located below the equilibrium price. When the price is below the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied.\nThere are several effects of a price floor. On the demand side, the price floor means that the demand will be less than the quantity supplied. On the supply side, the price floor means that the quantity supplied will be less than the demand. As a result of these effects, a price floor will usually result in a surplus.\nSOLUTION: A price floor is used when the equilibrium price is too high. The equilibrium price is too high when the price is above the market equilibrium price. A price floor will be located below the equilibrium price.

It describes the behavior of buyers, who will usually buy more of a good or service when its price is lower and less when its price is higher.\nThe theory behind the demand curve is that buyers will change their consumption of a good or service in response to changes in its price. When the price of a good or service falls, the quantity demanded will usually increase. Conversely, when the price rises, the quantity demanded will usually decrease.\nThe theory of demand describes the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded as a function. The function is usually a downward-sloping line. This means that as the price of a good or service falls, the quantity demanded will increase, but at a decreasing rate. In other words, the marginal utility of the good or service will decrease as consumption rises.\nMarginal utility is the additional satisfaction or benefit a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good or service.\nThe theory of demand can be summarized by saying that consumers will buy more of a good or service when its price is lower and less when its price is higher. They will continue to buy more until the marginal utility of the good or service falls to zero, which is when they are satiated.\nSOLUTION: The demand curve describes the behavior of buyers, who will usually buy more of a good or service when its price is lower.

There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.\n | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand\nSupply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up\nSupply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down\nProducers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.\nSOLUTION: An increase in printing costs will shift the supply curve for textbooks to the left. Higher printing costs make it more expensive to produce textbooks, which will usually lead to a decrease in the number of textbooks supplied.\nA decrease in the number of buyers will also shift the supply curve for textbooks to the left. When there are fewer buyers, the demand for textbooks will go down. As a result, there will be a decrease in the number of textbooks supplied.\nA decrease in the demand for a substitute in production will not shift the supply curve for textbooks to the left. A substitute is something that can be used in place of another good or service.

If demand is price elastic, then the quantity demanded responds significantly to changes in price. If demand is price inelastic, then the quantity demanded does not respond much to changes in price.\nThe level of price elasticity of demand depends on the nature of the good or service being demanded. For example, demand for essential goods and services is generally more price elastic than demand for luxury goods and services.\nSOLUTION: The demand for a monopoly firm's output is likely to be the least elastic. A monopoly is a market with a single seller. If there is only one seller of a good or service, the seller can charge a high price and still sell all of its output. Since the seller can sell all of its output at a high price, the seller is not affected by changes in price. So, demand is likely to be inelastic.\nDemand for the perfectly competitive firm's output is likely to be the most elastic. Many sellers offer goods or services that are identical to those offered by other sellers. Since the goods or services are identical, the price at which they are sold will affect the quantity demanded. So, demand is likely to be elastic.\nDemand for the oligopoly firm's output with a homogenous product is likely to be less elastic than demand for the perfectly competitive firm's output. Oligopoly is a market with only a few sellers. If there are only a few sellers of a good or service, they must cooperate to avoid competing with each other. So, the price charged by each seller will not affect the quantity demanded. So, demand is likely to be inelastic.\nDemand for the oligopoly firm's output with a differentiated product is likely to be more elastic than demand for the oligopoly firm's output with a homogenous product. If a good or service is differentiated, it means that it varies in quality. Since the good or service varies in quality, the price at which it is sold will affect the quantity demanded. So, demand is likely to be elastic."}

The marginal cost of an activity is the cost of the last unit of the activity.\nFor example, if a student is deciding whether to spend an additional hour studying, the marginal benefit of that hour is the benefit that the student expects to get from that hour. The marginal cost of that hour is the cost of that hour.\nBecause the marginal cost of an activity is the cost of the last unit of the activity, the marginal cost of an activity is always equal to the opportunity cost of that unit.\nSo, to decide whether the marginal benefit of an activity outweighs its marginal cost, you need to compare the marginal benefit and the opportunity cost of the last unit.\nSOLUTION: To decide whether the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost of the fourth hour, you need to know the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of the fourth hour.\nThe marginal cost of the fourth hour is the cost of the fourth hour.

An excise tax raises the cost of production, but the tax is usually passed on to the consumer in the form of a higher price.\nWhen a tax is imposed on a good or service, the tax burden is not spread equally across all consumers and producers. Instead, the tax burden is borne by those who sell or buy the good or service.\nFor a specific tax, the demand curve is not elastic if the tax does not have a noticeable effect on the quantity demanded. The demand curve is elastic if the tax causes a noticeable change in the quantity demanded.\nThe consumer's burden of a tax is the effect of the tax on the consumer. If the demand curve is elastic, the consumer's burden of a tax rises. This means that the consumer bears a larger portion of the tax.\nConsumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price. When a tax is imposed on a good or service, the consumer's surplus falls. However, the tax burden rises more slowly than consumer surplus. So, the consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic."}

That is, each firm has a homogeneous product, and there are many firms in the industry. Because of this, each firm has a relatively small share of the market. This makes it difficult for any one firm to charge a high price.\nOn the other hand, the firm is able to differentiate its product to some degree. This differentiation allows the firm to charge a higher price than it would in pure competition.\nIn the long run, a monopolistically competitive firm is able to continue operating with zero economic profits because the firm is able to charge a price that covers all of its costs."}

Trading goods and services allows nations to specialize in the production of a few items and consume a wider variety of items.\nA nation has an absolute advantage in producing a good or service when it can produce that good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another nation. The opportunity cost of producing a good or service is the value of the next best thing that is not produced.\nFor example, the opportunity cost of producing wine is the value of the next best thing that is not produced, which is olive oil. If it is cheaper to produce olive oil than wine, then Italy has an absolute advantage in producing olive oil.\nA nation has a comparative advantage in producing a good or service when it can produce that good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another nation, but not by the absolute largest amount.\nFor example, it might be cheaper to produce olive oil in Italy than in France, but France still has a comparative advantage in olive oil production.\nThe concept of comparative advantage can be used to show that trade can make both nations better off. If one nation has a comparative advantage in producing a good or service, the other nation has a comparative advantage in producing something else. They can trade items, so that each nation gets items that it is harder to produce.\nSOLUTION: The United States has an absolute advantage in anchovy production because it can produce anchovies at a lower opportunity cost than Peru. The United States has an absolute advantage in salmon production because it can produce salmon at a lower opportunity cost than Peru.\nTrading based on relative opportunity costs means that each nation is trading something it has a comparative advantage in producing for something it has a comparative disadvantage in producing.\nSo, the United States has a comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has a comparative advantage in anchovy production."}
