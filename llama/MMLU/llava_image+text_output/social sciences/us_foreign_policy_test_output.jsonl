A few important values have been at the heart of this debate.\nOne set of values has to do with the appropriate role of government. Some Americans feel that the government has grown too large and powerful, and that it has invaded areas of life that should be left to individuals and private organizations. Others feel that the government has not done enough to solve important problems, and that it should be more active in addressing the needs of citizens.\nAnother set of values has to do with the role of democracy in government. Some Americans are worried about the influence of big business and other powerful interests in government, and believe that democracy is being undermined. Others are concerned about the influence of ordinary citizens in government, and believe that democracy is being compromised by special interest groups.\nA third set of values has to do with the global role of the United States. Some Americans feel that the United States should be active in world affairs, and that it has a responsibility to promote democracy and human rights internationally. Others feel that the United States should be less active in world affairs, and that it should focus on its own affairs.\nSOLUTION: The New Populism was an expression of American cultural superiority.\nAmericans were proud of their country and felt that it was superior to others in many ways.

However, since the end of World War II, presidents have sent American forces into battle without formal declarations of war.\nPresidents have done this by sending forces into a conflict situation as part of an international coalition or by acting unilaterally.\nThe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the principal military advisor to the president and the other armed services. The chairman is not a decision maker on the use of military force.\nThe secretary of defense is a member of the president's cabinet. As the head of the military department, the secretary of defense has a duty to advise the president on the use of military force.\nThe power to declare war is important because it is necessary for the United States to enter a state of war. A state of war is different from a police action or a humanitarian intervention.\nA state of war is a formal declaration that the United States is at war. The executive branch can defend the country without a formal declaration of war. For example, the president can use diplomacy to end a conflict or go to the United Nations to get backing for military action.

The politics of foreign policy involve questions of how the United States should use its power and influence in the world. How can the United States keep itself safe? How can it keep the world at peace? How can it cooperate with other countries to advance its own interests?\nThe economics of foreign policy involve questions of how the United States can use trade and other financial policies to interact with other countries. What can the United States do to help American businesses compete internationally? How can the United States attract foreign investment?\nSOLUTION: The dominant course for foreign policy throughout most of American history can be categorized as isolationism. Isolationism is the belief that the United States should keep to itself as much as possible and should avoid getting involved in the affairs of other countries.\nDuring the colonial era, the United States practiced a strict form of isolationism. The colonial leaders tried to keep Europeans out of America and to keep Americans out of Europe.\nDuring the late 1800 s, the United States began to become more involved in the world. But the country still did not get involved in world affairs unless it was necessary.\nFor example, the United States stayed out of World War I until 1917. It took a while for the United States to decide that joining the war was necessary.\nThe period after World War II is the exception to the isolationist rule. After World War II, the United States became much more involved in world affairs. This period is called the era of containment.\nContainment is the belief that the United States should involve itself in the affairs of other countries to keep bad things from happening. For example, the United States passed the Truman Doctrine in 1947. The Truman Doctrine said that the United States would help any country that was trying to become democratic.\nThe period after the end of the Cold War is the exception to the containment rule. After the Cold War, the United States started to withdraw from world affairs. This period is called neoconservatism.\nNeoconservatism is the belief that the United States should involve itself in the affairs of other countries to spread freedom and democracy.\nProtectionism is the belief that the United States should protect its own economy from other countries. This belief is the opposite of free trade."}

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an example of this type of organization.\nIntergovernmental organizations provide a forum for states to discuss issues of common concern. They may also help states coordinate their policies.\nSOLUTION: Intergovernmental organizations do not usually provide strong enforcement.

One great idea from ancient Greece is the concept of the balance between opposing forces. This idea suggests that in many situations, opposing forces are interconnected and that changing one force will affect the other.\nFor example, the idea that the ancient Greeks developed to explain this concept is the seesaw. Their idea of a seesaw is that if one side is long, the other side will be short. This idea shows that for every force there is an opposite force.\nThis concept of balance between opposing forces is important because it helps to explain many things in life. For example, it helps to explain the balance between defense and social spending.\nDefense spending and social spending are two types of government spending. Defense spending is money that the government spends on the military. Social spending is money that the government spends on social programs, such as education and health care.\nThe balance between defense and social spending depends on the choice between two different types of spending: guns or butter.\nGuns are a type of defense spending. Butter is a type of social spending. So, the choice between guns and butter is the choice between defense and social spending.\nSOLUTION: The question asks you to choose the answer that best summarizes the trade-off between defense and social spending. The choice between guns and butter is the answer.\nThe seesaw model shows that the choice between guns and butter is the choice between defense and social spending. For example, if the government spends more money on the military, it will have less money to spend on social programs. Conversely, if the government spends more money on social programs, it will have less money to spend on the military."}

During the early years of his administration, he implemented a series of foreign and defense policies that would come to define his presidency.\nReagan's foreign policy was based on a philosophy of anticommunism, which meant that he saw the spread of communism as a threat to world peace and American security. In Reagan's view, communism was a dangerous ideology that had to be opposed everywhere it tried to take root.\nThe cornerstone of Reagan's defense policy was a policy of nuclear deterrence. Deterrence is the idea that a country can deter its enemies from attacking it by threatening to respond with overwhelming force. In the case of nuclear deterrence, a country with nuclear weapons threatens to respond to an attack with the destruction of the attacker. Reagan believed that the United States had to be able to defend itself with nuclear weapons.\nD\u00e9tente is the idea that two countries that are rivals and in competition with each other can relax and try to live in peace. During the administration of President Jimmy Carter, the United States and the Soviet Union began to implement a policy of d\u00e9tente. D\u00e9tente involved a series of diplomatic and trade initiatives that were designed to improve relations between the two countries.\nDuring the early years of his administration, Reagan's foreign and defense policies emphasized anticommunism and nuclear deterrence. At that time, d\u00e9tente was not a guiding principle of Reagan's foreign policy.\nInternational free trade is a system in which countries trade goods and services with each other. In a system of free trade, countries do not use tariffs or other barriers to keep out goods and services from other countries. In the early 1800 s, the United States adopted a policy of free trade. The policy was based on the belief that free trade would make the United States stronger."}

These negotiations generally focus on issues that arise when different countries produce and sell goods and services to each other.\nSome international trade agreements are established with a specific country or group of countries in mind. Other international trade agreements are more general.\nInternational trade agreements often include provisions on the following issues:\ntariffs (taxes) on imported and exported goods\ngovernment subsidies for exporters\ncopyrights and trademarks\nregulation of foreign investments\nlabor standards and human rights\nenvironmental standards\nSome international trade agreements also include provisions on issues that are not directly related to international trade. For example, a trade agreement might require a country to make it easier to negotiate international labor agreements.\nSOLUTION: When negotiators agree on the provisions of a trade agreement, they are using reciprocity across multiple issues. In other words, negotiators decide to get something they want from the other party, and that party decides to give something it wants in return.\nSide payments for adjusting to the organization is not a mechanism that international trade agreements use.\nA side payment is a transaction that involves giving up something of value without getting something in return. When countries join an international organization, such as the EU, they often pay a fee to join. This fee is a side payment.\nReputational concerns of the actors means that the government representatives want to be seen as responsible actors by the other party. In other words, they don't want to be perceived as the party that is not keeping up their end of the agreement.\nThis choice is not a mechanism that international trade agreements use.\nThe Common Agricultural Policy is a policy of the European Union. The EU uses this policy to support its farmers. The policy includes subsidies to farmers, as well as rules on farm production."}

According to this view, the United States was exceptional in that it was tasked with promoting these values globally.\nThis idea of American exceptionalism has affected American foreign policy and its approach to global economics.\nSome Americans have believed that the United States has an obligation to spread democracy and freedom through its economic policies. For example, some Americans have believed that the United States should promote free trade around the world. They argue that when other countries engage in free trade, the United States can increase its economic and political influence.\nOther Americans have believed that the United States should disregard global economics.
