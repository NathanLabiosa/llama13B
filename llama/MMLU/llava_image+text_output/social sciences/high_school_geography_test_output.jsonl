For example, a moving car will keep moving forward even after the driver touches the brakes.\nIn ecology, the term demographic momentum refers to the tendency for a population's growth to keep up, even after the population has grown to a larger size. This behavior is called demographic momentum.\nHomeostatic plateau is the tendency for a population to grow until it reaches a new, higher constant population size. This behavior is called a homeostatic plateau.\nZero population growth is the tendency for a population to remain the same size over time. This behavior is called zero population growth.\nRapid growth rate is the tendency for a population to grow at an accelerating pace. This behavior is called a rapid growth rate.\nSOLUTION: A population with a rapid growth rate is still growing at an accelerating pace. So, a population with a rapid growth rate has a tendency for its population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved."}

Migration can be influenced by both pull factors and push factors.\nPull factors are the benefits that people expect to receive by migrating. Some pull factors include better opportunities for work and family, a desire for a better quality of life, and safety reasons.\nPush factors are the problems that people face while living in one place. Some push factors include poverty, lack of job opportunities, and war.\nDistance decay is the tendency for migration to decrease with distance. This distance decay is caused by both push and pull factors.\nMigration selectivity is the idea that not everyone migrates. Some people don't migrate because they are unable to do so, while others choose not to migrate. Migration selectivity helps to explain why migration is not a random process."}

One of these disputes was the border between the United States and Canada.\nThe boundary between the two countries was established by treaty in 1842. Under the treaty, the boundary was to be a line that ran from Lake of the Woods to the 49th parallel. However, the surveys that were used to determine the location of the boundary did not agree on its actual location. As a result, there were disputes and disagreements over the location of the boundary.\nIn 1872, the United States and Canada signed a treaty that settled the boundary disputes. Under the treaty, the boundary was to be a line that ran from the Lake of the Woods to the 49th parallel.\nSOLUTION: A relict boundary is a boundary that is left over from a previous administration of a region. A well-known example of a relict boundary in the United Kingdom is the border between the counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire.\nLancashire and Yorkshire used to be separate administrative counties. When the administrative counties were abolished in 1974, the boundary between them was abolished as well. However, the boundary remains visible today.\nThe official language of the question is not given. However, the question uses the phrase well-known example. This suggests that the speaker or writer is looking for a country with a famous or notable example of a relict boundary.\nVietnam does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary.\nThe United Kingdom has a well-known example of a relict boundary.\nGermany does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary.\nBolivia does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary."}

These societies have grown and changed in response to their environments, but with the rise of manufacturing and the development of technology, the relationship between human societies and their environments has changed dramatically.\nNew technology has allowed human societies to exploit a broader range of environments. For example, the plow made it possible to farm soil that was previously too rocky or wet. The Industrial Revolution, which began about 200 years ago, brought mechanization, new materials, and mass production, significantly changing where people lived and how they worked.\nSOLUTION: Access to trade routes was the primary reason for the growth of manufacturing. As access to trade routes improved, the costs of moving goods, materials, and ideas decreased, and the value of goods and materials increased. As a result, commercial agriculture became more common, and the growth of manufacturing was possible.\nLimited forest cover was not the primary reason for the growth of manufacturing. Instead, the growth of manufacturing led to limited forest cover. Before manufacturing, forests were a critical source of food and other resources. As manufacturing grew, people began to use trees for wood, paper, and other products. This exploitation of forest resources made it difficult to maintain forest cover.\n Mediterranean climate was not the primary reason for the growth of manufacturing. However, a Mediterranean climate made it possible to thrive in some areas where farming was difficult. For example, the climate allowed farmers in southern Europe to grow grapes and other crops.\nAccess to trade routes was the primary reason for the growth of manufacturing. As access to trade routes improved, the costs of moving goods, materials, and ideas decreased, and the value of goods and materials increased. As a result, commercial agriculture became more common, and the growth of manufacturing was possible."}

Transnational corporations are one result of globalization. These corporations are businesses that have operations in more than one country.\nThe main motive for transnational corporations is to take advantage of comparative advantage. Comparative advantage refers to the idea that each country should produce and export goods and services in which it has a comparative advantage.\nA country's comparative advantage lies in the goods and services that it can produce at a lower opportunity cost than any other country. Opportunity cost is what you give up when you decide to do something. In this case, the opportunity cost of producing a good or service is the value of the next best option.\nFor example, an economy's opportunity cost of producing wine is the value of the next best alternative good or service. If the price of wine is increasing, the opportunity cost of producing wine is increasing. As a result, the value of the next best alternative good or service is increasing.\nIf the price of oil is decreasing, the opportunity cost of producing oil is decreasing. As a result, the value of the next best alternative good or service is decreasing.\nBecause comparative advantage determines a country's motive for trade, it also determines the motive for operations of transnational corporations. The goal of these corporations is to locate their activities in countries where they can take advantage of comparative advantage.\nSome businesses move their headquarters to low-cost countries. Other businesses locate their manufacturing or services in low-cost countries.\nSOLUTION: The choice \"based on comparative advantage\" is incorrect. Comparative advantage refers to the idea that each country should produce and export goods and services in which it has a comparative advantage.\nThis means that businesses should locate their activities in countries where they can take advantage of comparative advantage.\nManufacturing goods where production costs are the highest is an example of not taking advantage of comparative advantage. High-cost countries should not manufacture goods. They should import goods.\nConducting accounting and research services where economical is an example of taking advantage of comparative advantage. These services may be produced more economically in some countries than in others.\nHeadquarters located in LDCs is an example of not taking advantage of comparative advantage. LDCs are usually countries that need economic assistance. They are not places where businesses should locate their headquarters."}

A concept can help to explain something about the world.\nNew stores opening around a large shopping mall reflect which concept?\nThe concept of complementarity helps to explain this pattern. Complementarity is the idea that some features increase in proportion to others.\nFor example, as the population of a city increases, the number of cars on the roads and the number of people in central areas both increase.\nDistance decay is the idea that features are less likely to be in close proximity. Distance decay is a concept that helps to explain the relationship between two features.\nNew stores opening around a large shopping mall do not reflect the concept of distance decay. The presence of a large shopping mall does not mean that new stores will always open farther away from the mall.\nMovement bias is the idea that the direction of relationship between two features is from the less common to the more common. Movement bias is a concept that helps to explain the relationship between two features.\nNew stores opening around a large shopping mall do not reflect the concept of movement bias. The relationship between a large shopping mall and new stores is not from the mall to the stores.\nGravity is the idea that the strength of an effect decreases over distance.

Diffusion can happen in different ways, or patterns.\nStimulus diffusion happens when a change in the environment causes an organism to adopt a new behavior. In the nineteenth century, the government of India needed people to learn English to do business with the British. So, English was taught in schools. Being able to speak English opened up new opportunities for jobs and education. So, more people began to speak English.\nContagious diffusion happens when people who are in close contact with each other adopt a new behavior. In a community where many people are speaking English, it is likely that new members will start speaking English too.\nHierarchical diffusion happens when a change in the environment spreads through a community, starting with those who have the most resources or power. In the nineteenth century, the government of India needed people to learn English to do business with the British. It was not until later that more Indians began to speak English as a result of Hierarchical diffusion.\nRelocation diffusion happens when people move to a new environment and adopt the behaviors of the community they are moving to. In the nineteenth century, many Indians moved to British-controlled India after the annexation of Bengal in 1757. These Indians may have been forced to adopt English ways.\nSOLUTION: The use and spread of English in nineteenth-century India is an example of contagious diffusion.

They often try to explain things by looking at patterns.\nA theoretical framework is a set of ideas that explains things. These ideas can help you make predictions about how things will behave.\nFor example, the theoretical framework of natural selection explains how populations of organisms change over time. This framework provides evidence about what causes what in nature.\nSome theorists try to explain patterns in nature. Other theorists try to explain patterns in society.\nThese are some ways in which theorists can try to explain patterns:\nLook for patterns in numbers.\nLook for patterns in how things are organized.\nLook for patterns in how things change over time.\nLook for patterns in how things are related to other things.\nSome theorists focus on individual actions. Other theorists focus on social phenomena.\nAn institution is a pattern of behavior that is accepted as legitimate by a group. In other words, institutions are rules that people follow.\nAn example of a theorist who focuses on institutions is Ronald Coase. He tried to explain how institutions affect patterns of land use.\nCoase noticed that land prices can differ depending on how land is used. For example, land near a city is more valuable than land in the country. Coase wondered why this was so.\nTo answer this question, Coase looked at how people might behave if they owned land. He noticed that people might be influenced by how much they would have to pay to buy more land.\nFor example, if it is cheap to buy more land, people might use their land in a way that is profitable. But if it is expensive to buy more land, people might use their land in a way that is less profitable.\nSo, Coase developed an idea about how patterns of land use might be linked to patterns of land prices.\nThis idea can help you understand how land prices and land use might be related. It can also help you make predictions about how these things will change.\nSOLUTION: Rostow, Ravenstein, Von Th\u00fcnen, and Burgess all tried to explain patterns of land use.\nVon Th\u00fcnen tried to explain how patterns of land use related to the location of land. He noticed that land near a city is more valuable than land in the country. Von Th\u00fcnen developed a theory about how patterns of land use might be linked to patterns of land prices.\nBurgess tried to explain how patterns of land use related to the way people interact. Burgess noticed that people in cities interact with each other in different ways than people in the country. Burgess developed a theory about how patterns of land use might be linked to patterns of interaction.\nRavenstein tried to explain how prices of farm products related to patterns of land use. Ravenstein noticed that prices of farm products were higher in cities than in the country. Ravenstein developed a theory about how prices of farm products might be linked to patterns of land use.\nRostow tried to explain how patterns of land use related to the development of cities. Rostow noticed that the development of cities changed the way people lived. Rostow developed a theory about how patterns of land use might be linked to the development of cities."}

They can help you find places on globes and maps.\nLines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units of degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0\u00b0 latitude. We start counting degrees from there.\nLines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.\nLines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use units of degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0\u00b0 longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.\nThe equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different.

The food, water, and shelter available in an environment determine the types of species that can survive and reproduce there. Human populations are no exception.\nPopulation patterns, including the size and distribution of human populations, are shaped by the resources that are available. When resources are scarce, populations shrink. When resources are abundant, populations grow.\nThe conservation of wildlife and other species is important because ecosystems are made up of many different species. The relationships between species are critical to the functioning of ecosystems.\nFood production is shaped by the types of crops that can grow in an environment. Crops require soil, water, and sunlight to grow. Some crops can grow in dry soil, while others require water.

An ecosystem is created by the relationships that form among the biotic and abiotic parts of an environment.\nThe climate of an environment is the pattern of weather in the environment. Climate is created by the interactions of three major components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the biosphere.\nAtmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere are parts of the environment that work together to create an environment's climate.\nThe atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds a planet. It is affected by the planet's surface, which includes the oceans, continents, and ice. Air is able to move between the atmosphere and the earth's surface. As air moves, it changes temperature and humidity.\nThe hydrosphere is the layer of water in an environment. Water changes temperature very slowly. But water makes air cool down by evaporating. It also makes air warm up by changing from a solid to a liquid.\nThe biosphere is the layer of life in an environment. Living things are able to change the environment. For example, plants give off water as water vapor. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere. Other living things can change the surface of the earth. For example, living things dig in the ground. This digging makes it possible for water to pool. Water that pools is called a body of water. It can make the atmosphere cool down.\nSOLUTION: The climate of Great Britain is milder than most other places along the same latitude. This means that the temperature in Great Britain is not as bad as it could be for its latitude.\nThe Gulf Stream is a current that brings warm water to the coast of Great Britain. The warm water raises the temperature of the air as it moves over the land.\nHot springs are places where water moves through the earth. The water picks up heat as it moves. When the water reaches the land, it raises the temperature of the surrounding land and air.\nMountain ranges can break up wind. If a wind cannot go over a mountain range, it will go around it. The wind will cool as it moves around the mountain.\nSmall landmasses cannot hold much heat. So, the temperature of the surrounding land and air does not get very high."}
