Some measurements have an absolute zero, and others do not. Some measurements are ordered in terms of their values, and others are not.\nThe type of scale used in a measurement depends on the units. The units come after the number in a measurement.\nIf the units are different after the number, the measurement has an absolute zero. Temperature is a measurement with an absolute zero. The value zero is the lowest possible temperature.\nIf the units are the same after the number, the measurement does not have an absolute zero. Height is a measurement that does not have an absolute zero.\nIf the units are different before the number, the measurement is not an interval measurement.\nIf the units are the same before the number, the measurement is an interval measurement.\nRatio data is a type of interval measurement. It has equal intervals and no absolute zero.\nRatio data is used to describe the relationship between two variables.\nFor example, if you want to know if the price of a gallon of gas has an effect on the number of cars that visit a gas station, you could look at the ratio of the number of cars to the price of a gallon of gas.\nSOLUTION: Ratio data is an interval data with an absolute zero.\nLike other interval measurements, ratio data has an absolute zero.

Certainly, psychologists are human, and they cannot be expected to be completely objective in their work. However, psychologists should make a concerted effort to be aware of their biases and to manage them in an ethical manner.\nFor example, a psychologist's sexual orientation should not be confused with a client's sexual orientation. A psychologist's religious beliefs should not influence a client's decisions about birth control or other religious issues. A psychologist's biases about race, gender, or sexuality should not influence treatment decisions.\nSOLUTION: It is not appropriate for a psychologist to have a sexual relationship with a current therapy client. Doing so would likely harm the client and would definitely harm the psychologist. A psychologist should not refer to a sexual relationship with a former client as mutual. It is likely that a sexual relationship with a former client would harm the client and would definitely harm the psychologist.\nIt is not necessary for a psychologist to confess his or her attraction to a therapy client in order to work with that client. However, a psychologist should be aware of his or her attraction and should manage it appropriately. This might include consulting with a colleague or taking a step back from therapy if the attraction is interfering with the psychologist's objectivity."}

The following steps may be helpful:\nStep 1: Identify the problem. If a psychologist is not able to provide mental health services in a competent and professional manner, something is wrong. The psychologist should try to identify the problem.\nStep 2: Get help. If a psychologist has a personal problem that is affecting his or her work, getting help is important. This may involve seeing a therapist, counselor, or other mental health professional.\nStep 3: Consult with colleagues. A psychologist may benefit from consulting with colleagues who have experience in the area of concern. For example, a psychologist who is having difficulty with a particular client may consult with a more experienced psychologist.\nStep 4: Refer clients.

Association is the process of learning about the relationship between two events.\nThere are several types of association.\nPositive association: Two events are positively associated when they happen together. For example, eating food is positively associated with feeling full.\nNegative association: Two events are negatively associated when they happen together. For example, eating food is negatively associated with feeling hungry.\nStimulus generalization: When one event is simply associated with another event in your mind, you may respond to the first event as you would to the second. For example, if you associate a particular song with being happy, you may start to feel happy whenever you hear that song.\nStimulus discrimination: When you learn to tell the difference between similar events, you can respond differently to each event. For example, you may learn to tell the difference between a honk from a near car and a honk from a far car, and you may respond differently to each.\nClassical conditioning: Classical conditioning is a type of association in which one event is used as a signal for another event that naturally provokes a response. For example, if you hear a bell every time you eat, after a while you may start to feel hungry when you hear the bell, even if you didn't eat.\nOperant conditioning: Operant conditioning is a type of association in which behavior is associated with a consequence.

One of these theories is known as self-perception theory.\nAccording to self-perception theory, people tend to define themselves by their behaviors. When people's behaviors are inconsistent with their attitudes, beliefs, or values, they experience discomfort (dissonance). This discomfort can force people to change their behaviors so that they are more consistent with their attitudes, beliefs, or values.\nSelf-perception theory also suggests that people enhance their own sense of self-worth by associating or identifying with others who are successful. This social comparison can help people feel better about themselves.\nAnother idea from self-perception theory is that people tend to attribute their successes to dispositional factors and their failures to situational factors. For example, a highly skilled basketball player may attribute a successful shot to his or her inherent skill. However, the player may attribute a missed shot to the fact that he or she was tired or distracted at the time.\nA final idea from self-perception theory is that people infer their own attitudes and emotions by observing their own behaviors and the circumstances in which those behaviors occur. For example, a person who is excited and loud in a conversation may infer that she is excited.\nSOLUTION: Bem's self-perception theory states that people experience discomfort (dissonance) when their behaviors are not consistent with their attitudes, beliefs, or values. This discomfort can cause people to change their behaviors."}

Construct validity is the extent to which a set of tests measures the construct.\nWhen a construct validates a theoretical model, it means that the set of tests accurately reflects the aspects of the phenomenon that the model says are important. For example, if a model says that a phenomenon includes variables X, Y, and Z, and the tests include measures of X, Y, and Z, then the construct validates the model.\nA variable is a value or a score. A variable can be measured directly or it can be inferred from other variables. Some variables are objective, and others are subjective.\nA moderator is a variable that affects the relationship between two other variables. Source of the effect and mediator are types of moderators.\nA source of the effect is a moderator that affects the relationship between two other variables by changing the magnitude of the relationship. A source of the effect can make the relationship stronger or weaker.\nA mediator is a variable that affects the relationship between two other variables by changing the direction of the relationship. A mediator makes the relationship point in the opposite direction.\nConstruct validity threat is a specific type of moderator. It is a variable that affects the measurement of a construct. The presence of a construct validity threat can make the construct scores appear to be stronger or weaker than they actually are.\nA covariate is a variable that is related to both a dependent variable and an independent variable. A covariate is not a moderator, mediator, or construct validity threat.\nSOLUTION: Motivation is a construct. It is a set of variables that can be measured and that together form a specific aspect of a phenomenon.\nIf a researcher implemented a brief motivational interviewing intervention to increase client motivation in the hopes that increased motivation would lead to lower levels of problem alcohol use, motivation would be a construct validity threat.

In the past, this mental retardation was often attributed to the baby's mother. It was believed that the mother's lack of intelligence or poor nutrition during pregnancy was the cause. We now know that most of the time, the mother's intelligence and nutrition are not the cause.\nThe cause of mental retardation in babies is usually something that happens during pregnancy. For example, mental retardation can be caused by the mother's rubella (German measles). If the mother gets rubella during pregnancy, her baby may be born with mental retardation. Or, mental retardation can be caused by the mother's use of drugs or alcohol. If the mother uses drugs or alcohol during pregnancy, her baby may be born with mental retardation.\nA few babies are born with mental retardation because of problems with their genes. But these babies are not born with mental retardation because of their mother's mistakes.\nSOLUTION: The mental retardation associated with PKU is preventable with a special diet. Phenylalanine is a protein that can cause mental retardation in babies with PKU. The special diet prevents the baby from getting too much phenylalanine.\nBlood transfusions, removal of environmental toxins, and antibiotics are not used to prevent the mental retardation associated with PKU."}

An ANOVA can be used to determine whether there are differences among the means of the groups formed by the independent variables.\nThe main effects of a factor are the effects of each level of the factor by itself. For example, in an experiment with four levels of an independent variable, the main effects are the means of the two groups with each level of the independent variable.\nThe interaction effect of a factor is the effect of one level of the factor on the other independent variables. For example, in an experiment with two independent variables, the interaction effect of the first independent variable is the effect of each level of the first independent variable on the means of the groups formed by the second independent variable.\nSOLUTION: The interaction effect of a factorial experiment is the effect of one level of the factor on the means of the other independent variables.

Four main motivation theories are used to explain the factors that lead to individual differences in motivation:\nERG theory: This theory suggests that people have three basic needs:\nExistence needs: These needs include food, water, and shelter. In the workplace, these needs would be met by a job that provides basic compensation and security.\nRelatedness needs: These needs include a desire for social contact and relationships. In the workplace, these needs would be met by a job that provides opportunities to interact with others.\nGrowth needs: These needs include a desire for achievement and personal growth. In the workplace, these needs would be met by a job that provides opportunities for skill development and growth.\nExpectancy theory: This theory suggests that an employee's motivation depends on the employee's expectation of how a particular incentive plan will impact his or her pay. In other words, an employee is motivated by an incentive plan if the employee believes that the plan will increase his or her pay.\nEquity theory: This theory suggests that an employee's motivation depends on the employee's perception of how much longer and harder he or she works compared to others in the work group. An employee is motivated by an incentive plan if the employee believes that the plan will lead to a more equitable distribution of pay within the work group.\nTwo-factor theory: This theory suggests that an employee's motivation depends on the degree to which the employee perceives that the incentive plan motivates the employee to work harder and the degree to which the employee perceives that the incentive plan leads to a higher level of pay."}

In personality psychology, factor analysis is often used to identify dimensions of personality.\nDimensions of personality are like categories that describe the different aspects of a person's personality. Some of the most popular personality dimensions include Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. (For more information on these dimensions, see the \"Big Five International Personality Item Pool\" at <https://www.50dimensions.com/>.)\nWhen using factor analysis, a major concern of personality theorists has been specifying the number of dimensions necessary to describe personality. Researchers have consistently found that human behavior is described well by five dimensions.\nThe developmental sequence of personality dimensions is the order in which people tend to develop those dimensions. Some personality dimensions, such as Openness, tend to develop later in life.\nDifferential accuracy between dimensions is a concern about the amount of information that is explained by each dimension. Some personality psychologists have found that some dimensions, such as Agreeableness, are described well by factor analysis, while others, such as Emotionality, are not.\nConnections between personality dimensions and actual behavior is a concern about whether the dimensions identified by factor analysis actually describe observable aspects of behavior. Researchers have found that dimensions of personality do, in fact, describe observable aspects of behavior."}

These structures are made up of different types of nerve cells, or neurons. Where a neuron is located in the brain depends on the function of the neuron.\nSome neurons are involved in processing sensory information, such as information about what we see, hear, or feel. These neurons are in the sensory systems.\nOther neurons are involved in controlling the body's functions, such as movement or heart rate. These neurons are in the motor and autonomic systems.\nStill, other neurons are involved in higher-level processing, such as thinking and decision making. These neurons are in the limbic, neocortex, and association systems.\nThe insular cortex is in the limbic system. The insular cortex is involved in processing sensory information and in regulating emotions and behaviors.\nThe substantia nigra is in the limbic system. The substantia nigra is involved in movement control and in the release of certain chemicals that help regulate mood.\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus is in the hypothalamus. The suprachiasmatic nucleus helps control circadian rhythms, or biological rhythms that repeat about every 24 hours.\nThe entorhinal cortex is in the neocortex.

The term meta-analysis comes from the Greek word metas, which means across. A meta-analysis is a study that examines multiple studies.\nImagine that there are multiple studies on the effect of caffeine on sleep. Instead of reading all of the studies, you can do a meta-analysis of these studies. In a meta-analysis, you calculate the effect size, which is the difference between the groups in the studies. For example, you could calculate the effect size by subtracting the average sleep duration of the noncaffeine groups in the studies from the average sleep duration of the caffeine groups.\nA meta-analysis can also calculate an overall effect size, which is the difference between the groups in all of the studies. For example, the overall effect size in the studies on caffeine and sleep might be that caffeine keeps people from falling asleep.\nSOLUTION: Smith, Glass, and Miller performed a meta-analysis of the psychotherapy outcome research.

The developer of a therapy may observe that when clients suffer from certain symptoms, a particular approach can help alleviate those symptoms.\nImaginal exposure is a technique that involves mentally recalling a traumatic event in a non-distressing way. The purpose of imaginal exposure is to help the client confront and assimilate the trauma.\nHigher-order conditioning involves teaching a client new behaviors or responses that can help him or her cope with stress or other symptoms.\nRelaxation training involves teaching a client deep-breathing or other relaxation techniques to help reduce stress and anxiety.\nFixed visual attention involves helping a client focus his or her attention on a fixed point, such as a light. This can help the client reduce visual disturbances and become more grounded in the present.\nSOLUTION: EMDR is a complex therapy that involves a specific type of eye movement. According to the therapy's developer, eye movement seems to be necessary to access the frozen traumatic memories in a patient's unconscious mind. The eye movement seems to help the patient store new, more adaptive memories that can replace the traumatic memories."}

A student with a variable low self-esteem may believe that she is not good at math today, but good at math tomorrow.\nSome factors contribute to high self-esteem. These include having many positive experiences, feeling in control of your life, and having a sense of purpose.\nFactors that can hurt self-esteem include having many negative experiences, feeling out of control, and being overly self-critical."}

This is a term used to describe the match between a child's temperament and the demands and responses of the environment in which she develops.\nA goodness of fit exists when a child's temperament and the environment are a good match. This means that a child's temperament is well suited to the environment in which she is living. When this is the case, the environment tends to reinforce the temperamental traits that make it a good match. For example, a child with a slow and steady temperament is a good match for an environment that is consistent and predictable.\nA poorness of fit occurs when a child's temperament and the environment are not a good match. This means that a child's temperament is not well suited to the environment in which she is living. When this is the case, the environment tends to reinforce patterns of behavior that are not a good match for the child's temperament. For example, a child with a slow and steady temperament may be a poor match for an environment that is chaotic and unpredictable.\nBidirectionality is the idea that temperament and environment are connected in a reciprocal way. This means that both the child's temperament and the environment influence each other. For example, a child with a lively and outgoing temperament may be drawn to environments that are stimulating and exciting. At the same time, these environments may reinforce the child's outgoing nature.\nAttachment is a term that refers to the way in which a child bonds with other people. This term is often used to describe the relationship between a child and a caregiver. While attachment is a related concept, it is not the same as a goodness of fit. A goodness of fit is a more general concept that refers to the match between a child's temperament and the demands and responses of the environment in which she develops.\nDevelopmental contextualism is the idea that the environment in which a child develops affects her behavior. This is a related concept to a goodness of fit, but it is not the same. Developmental contextualism focuses on how the environment affects a child's behavior. A goodness of fit focuses on how well a child's temperament fits with the environment."}

This involves conducting a careful analysis of the organizational policies and practices that contribute to age discrimination.\nThe first step in this analysis is to identify which policies and practices are associated with age discrimination. This is important because it is often policies and practices that are in place for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons that end up having an adverse impact on older workers. For example, a policy of requiring employees to retire at age 65 is not necessarily discriminatory on its face, but it may have an adverse impact on older workers.\nThe second step is to determine whether the identified policies and practices reflect an adverse impact on older workers. This involves conducting an analysis of the specific policies and practices and their impact on older workers. This analysis should focus on whether the policies and practices in question are causing an adverse impact on employees over a certain age. For example, if a policy of requiring employees to retire at age 65 has an adverse impact on employees over age 65, then that policy reflects an adverse impact on older workers.\nThe third step is to determine whether the adverse impact on older workers is due to age discrimination. This involves assessing whether the policies and practices that are having an adverse impact on older workers are in fact discriminatory. For example, if a policy of requiring employees to retire at age 65 is due to an assumption that older workers are less capable, then that policy reflects age discrimination.\nSo, evidence of age discrimination exists whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing. In other words, it is age discrimination whenever an employee is fired because of their age, rather than because of their job performance.\nEvidence of age discrimination also exists whenever the affected employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss. This includes cases in which an older employee is denied a job or a promotion because of their age, and as a result, experiences a significant decrease in earnings.\nEvidence of age discrimination exists only when the majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically. This means that if only a few employees in a given age group are adversely affected, then evidence of age discrimination does not exist.\nEvidence of age discrimination exists only when company policy reflects adverse impact on older workers. This means that if the specific policies and practices that are in place at the company reflect an adverse impact on older workers, then evidence of age discrimination exists."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: A woman may transmit a genetic defect to her son, even though she herself displays normal color vision. This defect is caused by a gene. The mother and son may have the same genotype for this gene, but the son's phenotype for the trait affected by this gene is different from his mother's.\nThis situation can happen in two ways. The mother may have a dominant allele for the gene, and the son may have a recessive allele for the gene. Or, the mother may have a recessive allele for the gene, and the son may have a dominant allele for the gene.\nBoth the mother and son have the same genotype for the gene. But the son's phenotype is different from his mother's. So, the son's phenotype represents a characteristic of the son, not the mother."}

For example, does the study involve potential physical harm, psychological harm, or harm to dignity or respect?\nThe magnitude of the harm refers to the extent of the harm that will be experienced by the participants. For example, how many participants will be harmed, and how severely will they be harmed?\nThe principal concern of psychologists is to prevent potential harm to participants.

In doing so, you may encounter situations in which you are uncertain about the outcome. In these cases, you can use statistical methods to help you make a decision.\nOne situation in which you may be uncertain involves making a judgement about a population parameter. For example, you might be interested in how long it takes for a plant to grow under different conditions. You can gather data by measuring the growth time for a sample of plants. However, it is not possible to measure the growth time for all plants. So, you make a decision based on the data you have.\nWhen you make a decision based on data, you are said to be engaging in statistical decision-making. In this process, you choose a hypothesis and consider the consequences of rejecting or failing to reject it.\nThe null hypothesis is usually the hypothesis that is tested. It is usually a claim of no effect or no difference. For example, the null hypothesis for the experiment described above might be that there is no difference in growth time between plants grown in different soil types.\nThe alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that is not tested. It is usually a claim of an effect or a difference. For example, the alternative hypothesis for the experiment described above might be that plants grown in clay soil grow slower than plants grown in sand soil.\nThe level of significance is a threshold for what is considered a significant effect. Typical levels of significance are 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10. These levels are conventions. You can use different levels of significance, but you should make sure to use the same level of significance when comparing results across experiments.\nA type I error is the error of rejecting a false null hypothesis. In other words, you reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This error is also called an alpha error. The level of significance is the threshold for what is considered a type I error.\nA type II error is the error of failing to reject a false null hypothesis. In other words, you fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. This error is also called a beta error.\nThe graph below shows the retention area (the area on the right) and the rejected area (the area on the left). In statistical decision-making, you consider the consequences of rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is rejected if the area in the rejected area is less than the specified level of significance."}

Attachment theories suggest that the way in which people attach to others will affect their relationships throughout their lives.\nResearchers have identified four main types of attachment: secure, insecure avoidant, insecure resistant, and insecure disorganized.\nSecure. Children who have a secure attachment to their mothers have been found to be more sociable, independent, and self-reliant. They are more likely to be outgoing and to make friends. As adults, they are more likely to have secure relationships.\nInsecure avoidant. Children who are avoidantly attached to their mothers are usually shy and tend to be solitary. As adults, they may be socially anxious and have difficulty forming close relationships.\nInsecure resistant. Children who are resistantly attached to their mothers often have difficulty trusting people.

It is a powerful motivator of change in belief and attitude.\nWhen people are in a state of cognitive dissonance, they will often change their beliefs or attitudes to reduce the dissonance. The theory of cognitive dissonance suggests that people are more likely to change their beliefs in situations that are accompanied by forced compliance. Forced compliance occurs when a person is given a choice that is no choice (e.g., comply with this request or lose your job). In these situations, the person experiences dissonance between their compliant behavior and their internal desire to refuse.\nSOLUTION: When compliance is accompanied by a large reward, there is less dissonance. The person receives a benefit for complying, which reduces dissonance.\nWhen compliance is accompanied by a small reward, there is more dissonance. The person experiences internal dissonance between the desire for the reward and the compliant behavior that is required to obtain it.\nIn the predecision phase, the person has not yet complied. In this situation, the person may still reverse his or her decision, and the dissonance may not have arisen.\nWhen extreme polarization is present, the person is already committed to a side. The person experiences dissonance when complying would require changing to the opposite side."}

Chromosomes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the genes.\nA gene is a piece of hereditary material that contains the instructions that affect inherited traits. Genes affect things like a person's eye color and their risk of having a particular disease.\nAll people have chromosomes, and most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Most organisms use their chromosomes to contain their genes.\nA person's genes affect their observable traits, including their appearance, their behavior, and which diseases they may have.\nSome genes have types called alleles. An organism's genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nA person's genotype for a gene is their combination of alleles for that gene. So, a person's genotype for a gene may be either homozygous or heterozygous.\nA person's phenotype for a trait is their observable version of that trait, which depends on the person's combination of alleles. A person's phenotype for a trait may be either homozygous or heterozygous.\nSome traits, like flower color, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.\nDown Syndrome is caused by an extra copy of a chromosome. People with Down Syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two.\nKlinefelter syndrome is caused by an extra copy of the X chromosome. People with Klinefelter syndrome have at least one extra X chromosome.\nTurner syndrome is caused by a missing or incomplete X chromosome. People with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome.\nPrader-Willi syndrome is caused by a missing or incomplete region of the fifth chromosome. People with Prader-Willi syndrome are missing a part of their fifth chromosome.\nSOLUTION: Down Syndrome involves mental retardation and extreme obesity and is caused by a chromosomal deletion. People with Down Syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two.\nTurner syndrome involves missing or incomplete development of the ovaries and other female sex organs. People with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome.\nKlinefelter syndrome involves extra copies of the X chromosome in males. People with Klinefelter syndrome have at least one extra X chromosome.\nPrader-Willi syndrome is caused by a missing or incomplete region of the fifth chromosome. People with Prader-Willi syndrome are missing a part of their fifth chromosome."}

But power can be used in different ways. French and Raven identified five ways that managers can use power.\nReferent power comes from your ability to inspire respect and admiration. A manager with referent power is able to get people to follow her because of her personal traits.\nLegitimate power comes from your position in an organization. A manager with legitimate power can make sure that others do what she wants because she has the authority to make them.\nExpert power comes from your specialized knowledge. A manager with expert power can get others to follow her because they believe that she knows best.\nCharismatic power comes from your ability to make a connection with others. A manager with charismatic power can get people to follow her because they like and admire her.\nSome of the ways that managers can use power are more effective than others. For example, a manager who uses referent power may have difficulty getting people to follow her if she is not around. In contrast, a manager who uses legitimate power can continue to get people to follow her even when she is not around."}

Often, they study how people's thoughts and behaviors are affected by the people around them.\nFor example, how do people react when they are told that their behavior is displeasing to others? According to cognitive dissonance theory, people may change their behavior so that it is more in line with what they believe other people want to see.\nAnother way to think about this is that people may do things to prevent feeling inconsistent or contradictory things at the same time. For example, a person who believes that being environmentally conscious is important may feel cognitive dissonance if she throws away a wet swimsuit instead of hanging it up to dry. To reduce this dissonance, she may decide to stop throwing away her wet swimsuit.\nThe inoculation model is a theory that describes how people can resist persuasion. According to the inoculation model, if someone tries to persuade you that something is a bad idea, you may resist that persuasion by thinking about the downsides of the idea.\nFor example, if someone tells you that a new policy will prevent people from smoking, you may resist this persuasion by thinking about how the policy could be misused. For example, you may think about how the policy could be used to prevent people from going into a bar or a restaurant where people are smoking.\nPsychological reactance theory describes how people respond when they feel that their freedom is being taken away. If you feel that someone is taking away your freedom, you may respond by resisting or leaving the situation.\nFor example, if a teacher tells a student that he cannot leave his seat during a lesson, the student may feel psychological reactance. The student may resist by not doing the work or by leaving the class.\nThe deindividuation model is a theory that describes how people may behave differently when they are in a group. According to the deindividuation model, people may feel anonymous in a group and may behave more impulsively than they would on their own.\nFor example, if people are in a crowd and they see someone stealing, they may not report the theft. They may think that if one person in the crowd does it, then it is not wrong."}

These theories include sexual selection and parental investment.\nSOLUTION: Sexual selection and parental investment are the two theories used to provide the conceptual framework for the evolution of mating adaptations.\nSexual selection is a theory that explains how the preferences of one sex for certain traits in the other sex can change. These preferences can lead to the evolution of traits that are sexually dichotomous, which means that they are found in only one sex.\nParental investment is a theory that explains how the amount of investment that one parent puts into their offspring can affect the behaviors that the offspring exhibit. This theory can be applied to mating behaviors because the desire to attract a mate and have offspring is a motivation."}

When a therapist is congruent, he or she can be comfortable and genuine, even if the client is feeling angry or afraid.\nA congruent therapist is able to accurately reflect the client\u2019s feelings. For example, if a client is upset, a congruent therapist can help the client see and feel that upset.\nA congruent therapist avoids becoming emotionally triangulated with the client. This means that the therapist does not take on the client\u2019s emotions as if they were their own.\nA congruent therapist avoids making judgments about the client\u2019s behaviors. This means that the therapist does not see the client as bad or wrong.\nA congruent therapist is authentic and nondefensive.

But how do you set up these groups so that they are similar?\nOne way to do this is to have two groups of people who are identical in all ways except for the independent variable. For example, if you want to find out whether listening to music affects math performance, you could have two groups of students: one group of students who listen to music while doing math problems and a second group who do not.\nAnother way to do this is to select groups that are already similar with respect to the independent variable. For example, if you want to find out whether listening to music affects math performance, you could have one group of students who usually listen to music while doing homework and another group who usually do not.\nIn either case, the groups should be similar with respect to the independent variable and different with respect to the dependent variable. This setting is known as experimental design.\nSOLUTION: A cover story is a deception that is intended to influence the behavior of research participants. Deception can be useful in experimental design because it allows researchers to investigate how people behave when they are not aware of the research purpose.\nFor example, if you want to find out whether people tip more when the tip is automatically added to the bill, you could ask some participants to calculate the tip by hand and tell other participants that the tip has already been added to the bill. The group that is told that the tip has already been added is more likely to tip more, because they are not aware that the tip is automatic.\nThe Hawthorne effect is a type of deception that involves pretending that the research is about something else. For example, the researchers in the study described above could have told the participants that the study is about how food tastes.\nThe Rosenthal effect is a type of deception that involves accidentally giving participants clues about what the research is really about. For example, the researchers in the study described above could have told the participants that the study is about how much they tip.\nDemand characteristics are cues that participants can use to figure out what the research is really about. For example, the presence of a one-way mirror suggests that the research is about how people behave when they think they are being watched.\nDifferential attrition is when some participants drop out of the study because they do not want to participate in certain parts of the study. For example, some people might be uncomfortable with the deception used in the study described above."}

Unlike other aspects of development, there are no clear-cut answers about what is masculine and what is feminine. Children learn these values from the world around them.\nTwo theories highlight how children learn gender roles:\nThe psychodynamic theory says that children are born with a set of behaviors that are considered male or female. They learn what is expected of them by acting out these behaviors. Children also learn to behave in other ways by watching older people.\nThe social learning theory says that children learn gender roles by watching and imitating others. Children do not have a set of behaviors already assigned to their gender. Instead, they learn what is expected of them from their culture and the people around them.\nThe cognitive development theory says that children develop gender roles by thinking about how male and female people are different. Children create a mental picture of what is male and what is female. They then use these pictures to guide their behavior.\nThe gender schema theory says that children learn gender roles by organizing information about male and female people. Children form a picture of what is male and what is female. Then, they use these pictures to organize their behavior. Children who are more confident in their gender schemas will explore activities that match their gender.\nSOLUTION: Parents who are more protective of female children and who play more roughly with male children help their children learn gender roles. These parents follow the theory of gender schema. According to this theory, children form a picture of what is male and what is female. Then, they use these pictures to organize their behavior."}

Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nSome traits are determined by a single gene, while other traits are determined by multiple genes. An organism's genes may have types called dominant or recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as if they are the organism's only version.\nIf a gene has a dominant allele, its version of the trait will appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene.\nIf a gene has a recessive allele, its version of the trait will appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene.\nSome genes have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as if they are the organism's only version.\nDown syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality. Most people have 46 chromosomes.

Behavior is not just a function of the person's own attributes, and it is not just a function of the environment. Instead, behavior is a complex interaction of the person's attributes and the environments.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether behavior is due more to environmental or psychological factors, look at the specific question.

When this happens, you should consider invoking the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine.\nThe attorney-client privilege is a confidentiality privilege that applies to communications with a client. The privilege is waived if the attorney discloses the communication to a third party.\nThe work-product doctrine is a protection for documents and other tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for use in litigation. The work-product doctrine is waived if the party produces the work product to a third party.\nIf you believe the information is subject to the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine, you should not disclose it. Instead, you should inform the party that you would be happy to provide the information but that you cannot do so without violating your oath to protect client information.\nIf the party is not interested in the information, it does not have to be disclosed. If the party is interested, it may seek a court order.\nSOLUTION: Before asserting the privilege, you should consider whether the client waived the privilege. The privilege is waived if the client has put the confidential information at issue.\nIf the client has not waived the privilege, you should assert the privilege. The privilege is waived if the attorney discloses the communication to a third party.\nIf the client has waived the privilege, you may provide the information.

When you write a literature review, you are not simply reporting on the research of others. Rather, you are using the research of others to support your own claims.\nTo do this, you need to identify the themes or patterns of evidence that run throughout the literature. These themes may be in the form of a theory, a concept, an interpretation, or a hypothesis.\nTo identify these themes, you need to do a systematic search of the literature. You should aim to find every piece of literature that is relevant to your research question.\nHere are the steps to conduct a literature review:\nStep 1: Formulate your research question.\nStep 2: Identify the relevant literature.\nStep 3: Review the literature.\nStep 4: Identify the themes or patterns of evidence.\nStep 5: Analyze the themes or patterns of evidence.\nStep 6: Synthesize the themes or patterns of evidence."}

In non-experimental research, researchers simply observe variables in people or groups.\nWithin non-experimental research, there are two types of studies: correlational and quasi-experimental.\nCorrelational research is used when researchers want to observe how two or more variables are related to each other. Correlational research does not manipulate variables, but instead measures variables as they naturally occur.\nQuasi-experimental research is used when researchers cannot use a truly experimental design, but want to observe the effects of a treatment. In quasi-experimental research, researchers may not manipulate the independent variable, but instead select groups to receive a treatment or assign subjects to treatment groups.\nDevelopmental research is not a research design.

These stories are based on a person\u2019s interpretation of events and are usually created to explain feelings, behaviors, or symptoms.\nA person\u2019s fable is a type of schemas. Schemas are a way of processing information that involves categorizing experiences. They can be accurate or inaccurate.\nFor example, a person who has a schema about a dangerous world may interpret a close call on the freeway as dangerous. A person who has a schema about personal inadequacy may interpret a mark of 85 on a test as inadequate.\nSome schemas are created when a person is young.

Therefore, comparing cognitive abilities between young and old is complex.\nWhen researchers are interested in the decline of cognitive abilities with age, they often look at intellectual abilities. Intellectual abilities include verbal and nonverbal reasoning, working memory, and problem-solving.\nOne consistent finding in research on intellectual abilities and aging is a decrease in vocabulary. As people age, they tend to have a smaller vocabulary than younger people.\nAn increase in problem-solving ability and an decrease in response time have also been found. However, the extent to which these abilities decline with age varies among people.\nWord fluency, or the ability to generate words, is not usually included in measurements of intellectual abilities."}

For example, studies of social play in monkeys have been used to understand the development of social skills in children.\nResearch on imprinting in birds has also been used to understand human development. Imprinting is what happens when a baby animal learns to recognize its mother. In the 1950 s, animal behavior researcher Konrad Lorenz discovered that some birds imprint on the first moving object they see. This object will become their model for what a parent looks like. Lorenz believed that imprinting might be important in human development as well.\nHuman parents have long observed that young children learn to recognize their parents. Lorenz's research on imprinting in birds helped scientists understand how this recognition might work.\nSOLUTION: Lorenz's research on imprinting led to the search for a biological mechanism for recognition memory. Recognition memory is what happens when an animal or a person recognizes a familiar object or person."}

Each approach has its own theory of what causes problems and how to solve them.\nOne of the most influential approaches is cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy believes that behavior problems result from destructive thinking patterns. By learning healthier ways of thinking, a person can change his or her behavior.\nAnother approach is behavior therapy. Behavior therapy believes that behavior problems result from patterns of behavior. By changing behavior, a person can change his or her feelings and thoughts.\nA third approach is psychodynamic therapy. Psychodynamic therapy believes that behavior problems result from hidden thoughts and feelings.

The nature versus nurture debate raised questions about the extent to which inherited and acquired traits shape human behavior.\nIn recent years, the debate has shifted. Researchers now consider how genetic and environmental factors interact to affect behavior. For example, a person's genes may affect how strongly heredity and the environment interact to cause a behavior.\nSecular trends refer to changes that occur across an entire society over many years. These changes are not related to a specific age group.\nCanalization describes the stabilizing effect of genetics on individual differences in development. As a result of canalization, organisms with similar genes exhibit similar development.\nA critical period is a brief period during which an organism is highly sensitive to environmental stimulation. During a critical period, an organism's response to the environment is especially strong.\nSOLUTION: The sensitive period describes the differences in timing of physical changes that are found in children belonging to different cohorts. Children born during different years may reach puberty at different times. This difference in timing is not due to genetics, but rather to environmental factors. In general, children have reached puberty earlier in recent years. This trend is called a secular trend."}

Inherited and acquired behaviors are gained in different ways.\nInherited behaviors are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited behaviors. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited behaviors, from their biological parents. Inherited behaviors do not need to be learned.\nAcquired behaviors are gained during a person's life. Some acquired behaviors, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired behaviors, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired behaviors down to their offspring.\nAdaptations are inherited behaviors that help organisms survive or reproduce. Behaviors that are not adaptations may also be gained during a person's life.\nSOLUTION: Attachment is a type of behavior that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Attachment is an adaptation.\nResearch using animal models has shown that attachment behaviors can be gained and lost. This finding supports the idea that attachment is an acquired behavior.\nFrustration, homeostasis, and conditioning are not attachments.\nConditioning is a type of learning. It does not involve the gain or loss of behaviors.\nHomeostasis is the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment. It involves the functioning of the body's organs and systems.\nFrustration is a general feeling that can include feelings of anger or disappointment. It is not a specific type of behavior."}

For example, the client may be vulnerable to the psychologist's professional influence, and the psychologist's personal relationship with the client may compromise the trust and privilege associated with psychotherapy. Even after therapy has ended, the client may still be in a vulnerable situation, and the psychologist's personal relationship with the client may continue to have a negative impact on the client's well-being.\nTherefore, psychologists are not allowed to have sexual intimacies with former therapy clients. This includes situations in which the client has terminated therapy or the psychologist's sexual partner is a former therapy client."}

It is a strong motivator of change in beliefs and attitudes.\nWhen we are faced with cognitive dissonance, we have several options for reducing the discomfort. One option is to change our behavior. For example, if we have committed to a fitness program but have not been able to stick with it, we may change our behavior and make a new commitment to exercise more regularly.\nAnother option is to change our beliefs. For example, if we have committed to a fitness program but are experiencing self-doubt, we may change our beliefs and remind ourselves that it is normal to have self-doubt when trying something new.\nSocial psychologists have discovered that people are more likely to change their beliefs than their behaviors to reduce cognitive dissonance."}

In the 1800 s, public health was mainly concerned with sanitation and the control of infectious diseases. But as our understanding of health and disease has grown, so too has the scope of public health. Now, public health includes not only the control of infectious diseases but also the promotion of health, the prevention of chronic diseases, and the protection of communities from environmental hazards.\nThe six categories of objects that are relevant in the effort to promote and enhance health are:\n1. Personal behaviors: Health-damaging behaviors, such as smoking and excessive alcohol use, can be changed by education and advocacy.\n2. Environmental factors: The environment in which people live and work can be modified to reduce exposure to harmful substances and promote healthy behaviors.\n3. Policy and advocacy: Community health is shaped by local, state, and national policies. Advocacy can help improve those policies.\n4. Clinical care: Clinical care, such as vaccination and disease screening, can protect individuals from disease and promote public health.\n5. Social factors: Economic, social, and family structures can all influence health. Policy and advocacy can help improve these structures.\n6. Behavioral science: Understanding human behavior is critical to developing effective public health policies and programs."}

Inoculation involves providing people with information that undermines their beliefs before they are presented with a persuasive message. This process works by activating the part of the brain that handles unconscious processes, such as the reflex to swat away a fly.\nIn a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, researchers found that people who were inoculated against a persuasive message were later less likely to be persuaded by the message than people who were not inoculated.\nFor example, to inoculate someone against a persuasive message that tries to get people to drink more soda, you could first present the person with information about the negative effects of drinking soda. Then, when the person is presented with the persuasive message, her unconscious processes will activate the information you presented earlier, which will make it harder for her to be persuaded.\nSOLUTION: To inoculate someone against a persuasive message, you would warn the person that she is about to hear a message designed to change her beliefs.\nThis answer is consistent with the inoculation theory. Inoculation theory suggests that people can be protected against persuasive messages by being preemptively warned that they are about to be persuaded."}

For example, if a theory states that children from broken homes are at risk for trouble in adulthood, the key points are that broken homes are risky and that the risk affects adults.\nSome theories or studies have more key points than others. For example, the theory that states that children from broken homes are at risk for trouble in adulthood has only two key points, but the theory that states that children's behavior in school is affected by their parents' level of education has four key points.\nSOLUTION: Of the choices, the degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce is the best predictor of a child's post-divorce adjustment. This is because continued conflict between the parents is a strong predictor of which parent the child will live with, and which parent the child lives with is a strong predictor of the child's post-divorce adjustment."}

In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights.

The criteria for a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa include:\nRecurrent binge eating. This means eating a large amount of food in a short period of time.\nA sense of loss of control during binge eating.\nRecurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior. This means trying to undo the effects of binge eating. For example, a person might make themselves throw up or use laxatives.\nThe criteria for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa include:\nAn intense fear of gaining weight.\nA distorted body image.\nThe need to be thin.\nAmenorrhea. This means that the person has not had a menstrual period in at least three months.\nA low body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure of weight in relation to height.\nMaking a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa is not as simple as checking off criteria. Criteria may not apply to every person. For example, a person may have a fear of gaining weight, but this does not necessarily mean that the person has anorexia nervosa.\nSOLUTION: To make a differential diagnosis, you need to consider each diagnosis's criteria and determine which one fits the person's symptoms.\nThe choice of purging is incorrect. Purging is a key feature of bulimia nervosa.\nThe choice of maintaining a normal body weight is incorrect. Maintaining a normal body weight is a key feature of anorexia nervosa.\nThe choice of bingeing is incorrect. Bingeing is a key feature of bulimia nervosa.\nAll of the above is the correct answer.

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, you might want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. In this case, fertilizer would be the independent variable, and the number of tomatoes would be the dependent variable.\nExperiments can be designed to be controlled or uncontrolled. In a controlled experiment, the independent variable is assigned randomly to different groups. This makes it possible to compare the groups and determine if the independent variable affects the dependent variable. For example, if you want to find out if fertilizer affects tomato plant growth, you could assign fertilizer to some plants and not to others.\nIn an uncontrolled experiment, the independent variable is not assigned randomly to different groups. This type of experiment is not as reliable as a controlled experiment.\nSOLUTION: The cohort effect is when members of the same group exhibit similar patterns of disease because they share other characteristics, such as age.\nThe cohort effect can be confounded with the effect of age. For example, people born in the 1980 s have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than people born in the 1950 s. The difference in risk is because of the cohort effect. But it is also because people born in the 1980 s are, on average, older than people born in the 1950 s. So, the cohort effect is confounded with the effect of age.\nThe Rosenthal effect is when examiners unconsciously rate people differently depending on their name or demographic characteristics.\nThe Rosenthal effect can be confounded with the effect of demographic characteristics. For example, the Rosenthal effect can cause examiners to rate people with different names differently. But it is also possible that people with different names have different abilities. So, the Rosenthal effect is confounded with the effect of demographic characteristics.\nThe Hawthorne effect is when people in an experiment change their behavior because they know they are being experimented on.\nThe Hawthorne effect can confound the results of an experiment. For example, the Hawthorne effect can cause people to work harder in an experiment. But it is also possible that people work harder when they know they are being experimented on. So, the Hawthorne effect is confounded with the effect of being experimented on.\nThe carryover effect is when an experiment affects the dependent variable even when the independent variable is not present.\nThe carryover effect can confound the results of an experiment. For example, an experiment that tries to affect the number of seeds in a tomato plant may also affect the number of tomatoes. So, the carryover effect is confounded with the effect of the number of tomatoes."}

Attribution theorists have identified three ways in which observers can make errors in this process:\n1. Overattributing to situations. This occurs when an observer attributes another person's behavior to the situation rather than to the person.\nFor example, an observer might assume that a person is angry because he is in a hot environment. Overattributing to situations occurs when an observer assumes that a person is angry because of the situation, rather than because of the person's disposition.\n2. Underattributing to situations. This occurs when an observer does not consider the situation when making a causal attribution.\nFor example, an observer might not attribute a person's anger to the high temperature of the environment. Underattributing to situations occurs when an observer does not consider the situation when making a causal attribution.\n3. Overattributing to person-situation interactions. This occurs when an observer attributes behavior to the interaction between a person and a situation, rather than attributing it to either the person or the situation.\nFor example, an observer might assume that a person is angry in a hot environment, without realizing that the person is hot and angry. Overattributing to person-situation interactions occurs when an observer attributes behavior to the interaction between a person and a situation, rather than attributing it to either the person or the situation.\nSOLUTION: Underattributing to situations is the error that is most similar to what attribution theorists say is an error observers make in formulating causal attributions about the behavior of others."}
