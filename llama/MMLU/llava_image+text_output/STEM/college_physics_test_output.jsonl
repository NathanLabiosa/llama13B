The distance of an electron from the nucleus is called the electronic cloud.\nAn electron in an excited state is an electron that has absorbed energy from the atom. After an electron absorbs energy, it can move to a higher energy level.\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that you can't know the exact position and exact velocity of an object at the same time. In an atom, you can't know the exact position of an electron and the exact energy of an electron at the same time.\nThe Pauli exclusion principle says that two electrons in an atom cannot have the same set of properties. Two electrons in the same energy level cannot have the same set of properties.\nThe Bohr model of the atom uses quantum numbers to describe the energy levels of electrons. The quantum number for a given energy level is an integer.\nNuclear hyperfine coupling is a type of nuclear radiation.

It is made of a narrow beam of light that can be focused into a very small spot. This property of laser light is important for understanding how laser light creates interference patterns.\nWhen laser light falls on a pair of narrow slits, the light passes through the slits and overlaps on a screen behind the slits. The overlapping laser light creates a interference pattern of bright and dark fringes. The brightness of each fringe is determined by the difference in distance between the two paths of laser light and the distance between the slits. This difference is called the interference difference.\nThe frequency of a laser is determined by the number of cycles of the laser light that occur in one second. The higher the frequency of the laser, the more cycles of the laser light occur in one second. Since the laser light creates a pattern of fringes, the frequency of the laser affects the separation of the bright fringes.\nThe separation of the bright fringes is affected by the interference difference and the frequency of the laser. For a given interference difference, the higher the frequency of the laser, the greater the separation of the bright fringes.\nSOLUTION: The frequency of the laser light is doubled. This means that the number of cycles of the laser light per second is doubled. So, the laser light has twice as many cycles in one second as it had before. This will make the separation of the bright fringes twice as large.\nThe separation of the bright fringes is affected by the interference difference and the frequency of the laser. For a given interference difference, the higher the frequency of the laser, the greater the separation of the bright fringes. So, the separation of the bright fringes will be greater than 0.5 mm."}

A photon detector is made up of a material that absorbs photons. When a photon is absorbed, it transfers its energy to an electron in the material. The electron is then free to move through the material, and its movement can be detected.\nThe quantum efficiency of a photon detector is a measure of how well the detector converts photons into detected electrons. The quantum efficiency is a number between 0 and 1. If the quantum efficiency is 0.1, for example, the detector converts one out of every ten photons into detected electrons.\nSOLUTION: The probability that the detector will detect a photon is 1 minus the quantum efficiency. So, the probability that the detector will detect photons sent one after the other is 1 minus 0.1 = 0.9. This means that the detector will detect photons an average of 9 times, with an rms deviation of about 0.3."}

The molecules in the ionic lattice are linked together by the strong electrostatic forces between the positively charged atoms and the negatively charged atoms.\nSOLUTION: According to the BCS theory, the attraction between Cooper pairs in a superconductor is due to interactions with the ionic lattice.\nWhen a superconductor is formed, the atoms in the ionic lattice vibrate. These vibrations can cause electron pairs to form. The electron pairs then move through the superconductor.\nThe attraction between the electron pairs and the ions in the ionic lattice is what makes the electron pairs special. When the electron pairs move through the superconductor, they do not distribute themselves equally. Instead, they distribute themselves in areas with a lot of ion density. These areas are where the ions in the ionic lattice are most attractive to the electron pairs."}

One feature is that the spectrum has lines. These lines are created by atoms that are excited by energy from hotter atoms. The excited atoms move to a higher energy level and release energy. The released energy is emitted as a photon, which travels through space. Photons with higher energy have shorter wavelengths. So, the lines in an atomic spectrum are separated by shorter wavelengths as the energy level of the atom rises.\nAnother feature of atomic spectra is that the lines are shifted. This shift means that higher energy levels are shifted to shorter wavelengths, and lower energy levels are shifted to longer wavelengths. The amount of this shift is called the wavelength shift.\nThe wavelength shift is caused by the relative motion of the atom and the observer. The wavelength shift is different for atoms that are moving toward the observer and atoms that are moving away from the observer.\nIf an atom is moving toward the observer, the wavelength shift is shorter. If an atom is moving away from the observer, the wavelength shift is longer.\nSo, the wavelength shift can tell you the direction of the relative motion of the atom and the observer.\nSOLUTION: The spectrum of the quasar 3C9 is shifted so that the lines are three times as long as the lines in the laboratory. This means that the lines are shifted to the red. The wavelength shift is greater than the wavelength shift caused by the relative motion of the quasar and Earth. So, the relative speed of the quasar is greater than the speed of the quasar and Earth.\nThis is equal to the speed of light. So, the relative speed of the quasar is 2c."}

When an atom is ionized, it gives up or gains electrons. The resulting atoms or ions now have a charge. Because they have a charge, they can attract or repel other atoms or ions. So, the electrons move to different orbits around the atom's nucleus. Each orbit has a specific energy level. When an electron moves to a higher energy level, the atom or ion emits energy. The energy is released in the form of a photon, which is a wave of light. The photon has a certain wavelength, or color, that is, its energy.\nThe wavelengths of the photons in an emission spectrum are always decreased when an atom is more highly ionized.

For objects of equal mass, the angular momentum is proportional to the distance from the center of rotation.\nFor objects at different distances from the center of rotation, the angular momentum is proportional to the distance.\nSo, the angular momentum of A is twice that of B."}
{"question": "An object is thrown horizontally from the open window of a building. If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown? (Neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level.)", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "4.9 m"}, {"label": "B", "text": "9.8 m"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10.0 m"}, {"label": "D", "text": "19.6 m"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: An object's vertical speed is called its elevation. An object's elevation can be changed by a force, such as throwing the object upward.\nThe initial elevation of an object is usually described as the height at which the object is thrown. The height at which an object is thrown from a building is not necessarily the same as the height below which the object is thrown.\nAn object is thrown horizontally from the open window of a building. If the initial elevation of the object is h initial and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, the distance the object has moved is 2.0 m.\nSince the object is not moving upward while it is throwing, its elevation h initial is the height at which the object is thrown.\nSOLUTION: The object is thrown horizontally from a height of 10.0 m.\nThe distance the object has moved is 2.0 m. This is because the object is thrown horizontally from the open window of a building. While the object is throwing, its elevation is constant. So, the height at which the object is thrown is 10.0 m."}

The wavelength of a photon is related to its color. Shorter wavelength photons are bluer, and longer wavelength photons are redder.\nWhen white light hits a surface and moves through it, the surface reflects some of the photons. The reflected photons are bent, or reflected, back into the first surface. This bent light is called reflection. The color of the reflected light is determined by the wavelengths of the photons that are not absorbed.\nAs the diagram shows, the photons that are not absorbed have wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers. But the oil layer on the surface of the water absorbs photons with wavelengths between 500 and 550 nanometers. The oil layer reflects photons with wavelengths between 600 and 650 nanometers.\nSo, of the photons that are not absorbed, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 600 nanometers."}

So, an object has a constant velocity when the object is:\nmoving in a straight line at a constant speed, or\nremaining motionless.\nIf an object is not moving in a straight line at a constant speed, the object is accelerating.\nAn object is accelerating when either its speed or its direction is changing. So, an object is accelerating when the object is:\nspeeding up,\nslowing down, or\nchanging direction.\nSOLUTION: The airplane is moving at a constant speed and direction. So, the airplane has a constant velocity.\nThe payload is released from the airplane. So, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane is changing. The velocity of the payload is decreasing at 4.0 s after it is released. So, the payload is accelerating downward.\nThe only answer choice that describes the payload's velocity as decreasing is B."}

In our solar system, satellites are called moons. For example, Earth's moon orbits Earth.\nThe time it takes for a satellite to make one revolution around the object it orbits is called the period of the satellite. The period is related to the mass of the satellite and the object it orbits.\nThe period of a satellite is independent of the radius of its orbit. So, the period does not depend on the distance between the satellite and the object it orbits.\nSOLUTION: Look for the answer that is proportional to m^(1/2).\nThe period of a satellite is proportional to the square root of the mass of the satellite. So, the period is independent of the mass of the object the satellite orbits."}
