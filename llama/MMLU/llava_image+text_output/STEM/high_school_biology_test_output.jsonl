Cellular respiration involves many different reactions, but two of the main reactions are glycolysis, which breaks down glucose, and the electron transport chain, which is part of a process called oxidative phosphorylation.\nWhen a cell breaks down sugar in a reaction called glycolysis, the sugar is broken down into two molecules of a compound called pyruvic acid. Pyruvic acid is later broken down to release energy.\nThe electron transport chain is responsible for producing ATP, or adenosine triphosphate. ATP is a molecule that cells use to store energy. When cells need energy, ATP releases its energy to help the cell perform work.\nNADH is a molecule that is produced during the electron transport chain. NADH is later used in a process called cellular respiration to release energy."}

The cell membranes of organelles surround internal structures that perform specific functions.\nOne advantage of having internal organelles is that cellular processes can be compartmentalized, or separated from each other. This separation allows cells to perform different functions simultaneously and also helps maintain the integrity of the cell. For example, digestive enzymes in a eukaryotic cell may be broken down into organelles that can digest food and other organelles that can process waste. This allows the cell to digest food and remove waste simultaneously.\nAnother advantage of having internal organelles is that cellular processes can be organized more efficiently. For example, organelles such as the mitochondria and the nucleus can be placed close to each other because they do not have to be separated by a cell membrane. This makes it more efficient for the cell to use metabolic pathways that are close together."}

X and Y chromosomes are different types of sex chromosomes. In the past, it was believed that the Y chromosome was responsible for maleness. However, it is now known that the Y chromosome is mostly inactive.\nInactivation of the X and Y chromosomes is the reason why males and females are different. The process of inactivation happens during egg and sperm formation. For a sperm or an egg, one X or Y chromosome is inactivated. In this way, each sperm or egg has either one active X chromosome or one active Y chromosome.\nAfter fertilization, the offspring's chromosomes are formed by combining the mother's and father's chromosomes. The offspring's chromosomes can be either active or inactive.\nAn inactivated X chromosome results in females who are not sterile. An inactivated X chromosome also results in females who have half their cells having one X chromosome inactivated and the other half having the other X chromosome inactivated.\nAn inactivated Y chromosome does not result in males or females being sterile. An inactivated Y chromosome results in a man being inactivated. In other words, the man appears female."}

Cells need energy to function. They use energy from food to power their activities.\nCells break down sugar and release energy that is used to power cell activities. Cells can use different sugar molecules as fuel. Cells break down sugar molecules by breaking the bonds between the atoms in the molecules. Breaking these bonds releases energy in the form of new bonds.\nThe bonds in sugar molecules are broken by enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that can catalyze reactions. A catalyst accelerates a reaction. Enzymes accelerate reactions by lowering the activation energy for the reaction. The activation energy is the energy that must be overcome to start a reaction.\nCells use enzymes to break down sugar molecules and release energy. Cells also use enzymes to build new sugar molecules. Buildling these sugar molecules is called biosynthesis.\nSOLUTION: Glycolysis is the breakdown of sugar molecules. Glycolysis releases energy that can be used by cells.\nThe reactions that break down sugar molecules in glycolysis are different from the reactions that build them. Because these reactions do not build new sugar molecules, they do not require energy to be released. Instead, these reactions proceed in the opposite direction. This process is called fermentation.\nFermentation does not wait for energy from the breakdown of sugar. Instead, it releases energy that is not used by the cell. This energy can be used by other cells."}

For example, people select plants or animals for breeding by choosing individuals that have traits that they like. The next generation grows from the offspring of these chosen individuals. This process is called artificial selection.\nNatural selection is caused by the environment. Individuals that have traits that help them survive or reproduce in their environment are more likely to make offspring. The next generation grows from the offspring of these individuals. This process is called natural selection.\nSexual selection is caused by choice. Individuals of the opposite sex choose mates that have traits that they find attractive. The next generation grows from the offspring of these mates. This process is called sexual selection.\nFrequency-dependent selection is a type of sexual selection. It happens when the likelihood of an organism surviving or reproducing depends on how common its traits are in the population. For example, if all members of a population have a certain trait, an organism with a different trait may have a better chance of surviving or reproducing."}

The degree of genetic variability within a population is called within-population variation. Populations have both hereditary material and information about how to replicate their hereditary material.\nOrganisms that have sexual reproduction have genetic material called chromosomes. Chromosomes are passed from parents to offspring. Sexual reproduction allows chromosomes to be shuffled and reshuffled, which increases genetic variability.\nPopulations of organisms that have asexual reproduction do not shuffle their genetic material. As a result, offspring have the same genetic material as their parents. Asexual reproduction does not increase genetic variability.\nMutation is a change in the genetic material. Some mutations occur during a organism's life. These are called de novo mutations. Other mutations occur before an organism is born. These are called inherited mutations.\nMutation is a major source of genetic variability. But mutation does not increase within-population variation. Instead, mutation creates new alleles. An allele is a form of a gene. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain information about a trait.\nSome alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as if they are different alleles. When an organism's genetic material has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype is the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait. When an organism's genetic material has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype is the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nSo, in a population, some alleles will have the dominant type and some will have the recessive type. This makes the population's genetic material more diverse.\nSOLUTION: Sporulation, binary fission, and vegetative propagation do not increase within-population variation. These methods of reproduction do not create new alleles.\nMutation is a major source of genetic variability. Mutation creates new alleles. So, mutation contributes the most to genetic variability in a population."}

Some mutations may affect traits, while others do not.\nSelection is the process by which organisms with certain traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. This makes those traits more common in the population. Natural selection is just one type of selection.\nGene flow is the movement of alleles into a population from other populations. Gene flow can introduce new alleles into a population. It can also remove alleles from a population.\nGenetic drift is the chance change in the frequency of alleles in a population. Genetic drift can cause allele frequencies to change randomly. It can also cause alleles to be lost from a population.\nEvolution is the result of all of these processes. Populations that have a higher total number of offspring than other populations will have more alleles in the next generation. Over many generations, these alleles can lead to changes in the traits of the population.\nSOLUTION: Evolution is the result of the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes. Most-fit means best adapted to the environment.\nThe most-fit phenotypes are those that survive and reproduce the most. These phenotypes have the most offspring. Over time, offspring with these phenotypes come to make up a larger fraction of the population.\nThis process is called natural selection. It is the most important mechanism of evolution."}

If one tree receives more of these resources than the other, it may grow taller or wider than the other tree. This scenario is an example of intraspecific competition.\nInterspecific competition can also be neutral, harmful, or beneficial.\nCompetition for food may be harmful to the competing organisms. If interspecific competition for food is too strong, one of the species may not survive.\nInterspecific competition for water may be beneficial to the competing organisms. If interspecific competition for water is strong, the organisms may be forced to grow in different areas.\nNatural selection is not intraspecific competition. In natural selection, some organisms have a survival or reproduction advantage.\nIf one tree is better able to survive or reproduce than the other tree, then the better tree may come to dominate the stand.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Hydrangea flowers have one gene for flower color. Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. This phenomenon is called phenotypic expression. The type of soil affects the expression of the flower color gene, but it does not affect the gene itself. So, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\nThe gene for flower color shows phenotypic expression. The alleles for flower color are not dominant or recessive. So, the environment alters the expression of a trait."}

In order to function properly, a cell must have a certain set of structures. The most important structures for all cells are the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and genetic material. The plasma membrane acts as a barrier and a gatekeeper for the cell. The cytoplasm helps the cell maintain its shape and supports the other cell structures. The genetic material stores information that affects cell functions.\nOther cell structures are not present in all cells. For example, not all cells have mitochondria or vacuoles. Cells that do not have these structures are not necessarily abnormal. Different cells have different structures, and each structure has a different function.\nSOLUTION: The surface-to-volume ratio of all cells is the same.\nAll cells have a surface and a volume. The surface-to-volume ratio shows how the cell's surface area compares to its volume. This ratio is important because it affects how easily substances can enter and leave the cell.\nAll cells have a cell membrane. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The alleles for pigment deposition (E or e) are said to be epistatic to the gene that codes for black or brown pigment. This means that the E or e alleles affect the gene for black or brown pigment.\nThe E allele is present in the animal's genotype if E is present. The E allele does not affect the animal's phenotype for black or brown pigment if the animal's genotype also contains the allele for black or brown pigment. If the animal's genotype does not contain the allele for black or brown pigment, the E allele will cause the animal's fur to be yellow.\nThe e allele is present in the animal's genotype if e is present. The e allele does not affect the animal's phenotype for black or brown pigment if the animal's genotype also contains the allele for black or brown pigment. If the animal's genotype does not contain the allele for black or brown pigment, the e allele will cause the animal's fur to be yellow.\nSo, BBEe will be yellow. The B allele, which codes for black fur, is present in the animal's genotype. The E allele is present in the animal's genotype. The e allele does not affect the animal's phenotype for black or brown pigment."}

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA gene's dominant allele is represented by an uppercase letter, and its recessive allele is represented by a lowercase letter. So, the genotype Ff is composed of one dominant allele and one recessive allele. The genotype FF and ff are each composed of two identical alleles.\nIn pea plants, the gene Ft is for purple flowers. The only two possible alleles for this gene are F and f. Here are how these alleles determine pea plant phenotypes:\nFf is for purple flowers.\nff is for white flowers.\nFF and ff are both for purple flowers.\nThe trapdoor mechanism is the type of inheritance that causes a recessive allele's version of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype only when the organism's genotype contains only recessive alleles for the gene.\nIn pea plants, the Ff genotype shows the trapdoor mechanism in action.

So, the gray phenotype is not caused by a recessive allele.\nThe gray phenotype is not caused by a dominant allele. So, the gray phenotype is caused by a mutation.\nA mutation is a change in an organism's genotype. This change may give the organism a new phenotype.\nSome mutations are in noncoding regions of a gene. Noncoding regions do not code for proteins. But these regions can affect how a gene's protein is made.\nOther mutations are in coding regions of a gene. Coding regions code for a protein. A mutation in a coding region may change a protein.\nHere are some ways in which a mutation in a coding region of a gene may change a protein:\nA single nucleotide may change:\nA single nucleotide may not change a protein's amino acid.\nA single nucleotide may change an amino acid.\nMultiple nucleotides may change:\nMultiple nucleotides may change an amino acid.\nMultiple nucleotides may change an amino acid in a way that affects the protein's function.\nA frameshift is a change that affects an entire amino acid.

Every population is formed of individuals. Populations of organisms are made up of many individuals. Some of the individuals in a population will have traits that are different from others. These differences are called variations. Because variations are hereditary, they can be passed from parents to offspring. Organisms that have variations that are useful to their survival and reproduction are more likely to have offspring. Over time, this can cause the useful variations to become more common in the population. Organisms that have variations that are harmful to their survival and reproduction are less likely to have offspring. Over time, this can cause the harmful variations to become less common in the population.\nSOLUTION: Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population. This statement is incorrect. Variations can also be created by reproduction and by the environment.\nEvery population has tremendous variation. This statement is incorrect. Not every population has tremendous variation. Populations may differ in their levels of variation.\nEvolution is a gradual process that occurs over a long period of time. This statement is incorrect. Evolution may occur quickly or slowly, depending on the organisms and the environment.\nOrganisms will overpopulate area, giving rise to competition. This statement is incorrect. Competition may arise when organisms are in the same area, but it is not a result of organisms overpopulating an area."}

Ecologists often examine how the interactions among organisms affect population sizes.\nThere are many different types of populations. One way to classify populations is by the type of selection they experience. Selection is the process by which organisms with certain traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.\nDirectional selection is caused by a change in the environment. A population may experience directional selection when there is a change in the balance of predation. For example, if a population of foxes is being preyed upon by wolves, directional selection may lead to foxes that can run faster than others. This would make it more likely that those foxes survive and reproduce.\nStabilizing selection is caused by a change in the environment that affects the population's range. A population may experience stabilizing selection when there is a change in the availability of resources. For example, if there is a change in the availability of food in a population of birds, stabilizing selection may lead to birds that need less food. This would make it more likely that those birds survive and reproduce.\nDisruptive selection is caused by a change in the environment that makes different types of organisms compete with each other. A population may experience disruptive selection when there is a change in the type of predators. For example, if a population of rabbits is being preyed upon by different types of wolves, disruptive selection may lead to rabbits with different types of fur. This would make it more likely that those rabbits survive and reproduce.\nSympatric speciation is the process by which one species splits into two species. This can happen when different populations of organisms become isolated from each other. For example, if a storm separates a population of birds into two groups, sympatric speciation may happen if the two groups of birds become unable to reproduce."}

This is because the environment affects which genes are turned on and off. So, even though all people have the same genes, there are differences in how those genes are expressed.\nMany of the variations that make people different from each other are caused by changes in the DNA code. These changes are called mutations. Some mutations happen because of mistakes during cell division. Other mutations are caused by the environment.\nSome mutations can have effects that are not harmful. Other mutations can harm an organism. But harmful mutations can also have effects that are not harmful. For example, a mutation that makes people more sensitive to a certain smell could be harmful or it could be helpful.\nSOLUTION: The main source of variation in humans is shuffling of alleles. Alleles are different forms of a gene. So, the shuffling of alleles is what is responsible for the greatest variation in humans.\nSOLUTION: Changes in the environment do not cause mutations. But the environment can affect which genes are turned on and off. So, changes in the environment can cause some of the variation in human populations.\nGenetic drift does not cause the greatest variation in humans.

In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.\nThe solute joins the solvent to form a solution. In a solution, the solute particles are spread throughout the solvent.

Macrophages are a type of immune cell. Macrophages can remove the dead cell and its chemicals, but they can also cause damage.\nApoptosis is widespread across several kingdoms. Apoptosis is used by many different types of cells.\nApoptosis is involved in the development of fingers. When a fetus is growing, the cells in its fingers need to divide. But the cells in between the fingers do not. Apoptosis is used to kill the cells in between the fingers. This makes room for the cells that are needed.\nApoptosis can be induced by cell signaling. Cells can send signals to other cells. These signals can tell cells to die by apoptosis."}

This transport can happen in different ways.\nExocytosis is the process by which cells move substances out of the cell. Exocytosis occurs through the membrane of a vesicle.\nEndocytosis is the process by which cells move substances into the cell. Endocytosis occurs when the cell membrane engulfs a substance.\nTransport across a membrane is important for cell survival. Cells that are not able to transport substances across their membranes cannot survive.\nSOLUTION: Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate that is stored in lysosomes. Lysosomes can break down glycogen and release glucose. The breakdown of glycogen is necessary for the cell to obtain energy.\nAn inherited disorder called Pompe disease is caused by a malfunction in an enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase. In Pompe disease, glycogen breakdown in the cytosol occurs normally and blood glucose levels are normal, yet glycogen accumulates in lysosomes. This suggests a malfunction with enzymes in the lysosomes.\nMembrane transport during endocytosis is the process by which substances are moved into the cell. But in Pompe disease, glycogen is moving into the lysosomes.

Chromosomes contain genes, or pieces of hereditary material, that affect inherited traits.\nGregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, discovered that organisms have genes that are passed from parents to offspring. His work helped scientists understand how traits are passed down.\nGenes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Females with Turner's syndrome have a high incidence of hemophilia, a recessive, X-linked trait. This means that the gene for hemophilia is on the X chromosome, and that the recessive allele for this gene causes hemophilia.\nX chromosomes have a gene for the sex hormone chromosome. This gene has two possible alleles. Other X-linked genes, including the gene for hemophilia, are found on the X chromosome.\nThe X chromosome has a special role in the inheritance of X-linked traits. Because females have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of most X-linked genes. One copy of an X-linked gene is inherited from each parent.\nFor an X-linked trait, the type of allele inherited from each parent affects the organism's phenotype. Some X-linked traits, like the sex hormone chromosome, are controlled by alleles that are dominant or recessive. Other X-linked traits, like some forms of color blindness, are controlled by alleles that are neither dominant nor recess"}

Mitochondria help power the cell by producing ATP. Chloroplasts use photosynthesis to produce ATP.\nChemiosmosis is similar to cellular respiration in that it also produces ATP. But instead of using oxygen, chemiosmosis uses an ion called hydrogen.\nCells that use chemiosmosis to produce ATP use a molecule called glucose. When glucose is broken down, hydrogen ions are released. The hydrogen ions move into the mitochondria or chloroplasts, and their energy is used to produce ATP.\nFermentation is what happens when cells do not have enough oxygen. When this happens, cells use anaerobic respiration, or fermentation, to produce ATP. Fermentation also produces ethanol, which is a type of alcohol.\nFermentation does not produce as much ATP as cellular respiration, but it does produce ATP quickly. Cells that use fermentation to produce ATP can survive without oxygen.\nGlycolysis is the first step in cellular respiration. It happens in the cytoplasm.

{"question": "Before the human genome was sequenced by the Human Genome Project, scientists expected that they would find about 100,000 genes.

How is it that different cells can have different traits? The answer is epigenetics.\nEpigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function that do not involve changes to the DNA sequence. In other words, epigenetics looks at how the genes in our cells can change over the course of a person's life.\nSome epigenetic changes occur naturally as a person ages. Other epigenetic changes can be caused by the environment. For example, scientists have found that rats living in stressful environments have epigenetic changes in their genes.\nSOLUTION: Scientists used to think that genes were like buttons on a jacket. Each gene was a button, and each button contributed to the overall appearance of the jacket. But scientists have since discovered that genes are more like the instructions for putting together a jacket.\nIn the instructions, each button is described in detail. But the instructions also include other information, such as how to assemble the buttons. This other information is called the gene structure.\nThe gene structure includes parts called exons and introns. Exons are like the buttons on a jacket. Introns are the instructions for assembling the buttons.\nScientists used to think that introns were simply discarded after they were transcribed from DNA to RNA. But introns are actually included in a type of RNA called messenger RNA.\nWhen a cell uses a gene to make a protein, it first transcribes the gene into RNA. The RNA is then processed by removing the introns and joining the exons. The resulting RNA is then used as a template for making the protein.\nAlternative splicing is what happens when a gene is transcribed into RNA, but the RNA is then processed in a different way. This means that the RNA includes different combinations of exons.\nFor example, a gene might have two exons. But when the gene is transcribed into RNA, the RNA can be processed in such a way that it includes only one of the exons. Or, the RNA can be processed in such a way that it includes both exons.\nDifferent forms of RNA can be used to make different forms of a protein. So, a single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing."}

The operon contains an operator, or regulatory, region and a structural, or coding, region.\nThe operator region is where transcription is initiated. If the operator is unoccupied, the RNA polymerase enzyme begins transcribing the structural region. If the operator is occupied by a protein called a repressor, the RNA polymerase is prevented from initiating transcription.\nA repressor can bind to the operator when the repressor is formed from a specific transcription factor. If the transcription factor is present, it will bind to the operator and prevent the RNA polymerase from initiating transcription. If the transcription factor is not present, it will not form a repressor, and the RNA polymerase can initiate transcription.\nAn enhancer is a regulatory region that can increase the amount of RNA produced by an operon. An enhancer does not affect the initiation of transcription. Instead, it increases the rate at which RNA is produced once transcription has begun.\nAn activator is a transcription factor that can bind to a promoter and increase the rate of transcription. An activator can also promote transcription from a distant site on a chromosome.\nA promoter is a regulatory region that contains a binding site for the RNA polymerase.

Numerous plants and animals live in tropical rain forests. The diagram below shows some ways in which plants and animals in a tropical rain forest are linked.\nAs you can see, plants and animals in a tropical rain forest are linked in many ways. By destroying a tropical rain forest, you destroy these links. So, clear-cutting tropical rain forests has negative consequences not only for the plants and animals that live there, but also for the people who rely on those plants and animals for food, shelter, and other resources.\nSOLUTION: Deforestation allows more sunlight to penetrate areas that were kept dark by dense vegetation. This change can affect the surfaces of soil and water in the area.\nSome of the sunlight that reaches the ground is absorbed by the soil. This absorbed energy can cause the temperature of the soil to increase. Because the soil cannot absorb more heat than it receives, the temperature of the soil will increase until the amount of absorbed energy equals the amount of energy that the soil emits.\nSoil temperature affects soil moisture. When the temperature of the soil increases, the soil dries out. This drying effect on soil moisture can reach over 20 feet (6 meters) into the soil.\nSunlight that does not get absorbed by the soil eventually reaches the water in rivers and streams. Some of the sunlight that reaches the water is absorbed by the water. This absorbed energy can cause the temperature of the water to increase. Because the water cannot absorb more heat than it receives, the temperature of the water will increase until the amount of absorbed energy equals the amount of energy that the water emits.\nAn increase in water temperature can affect the fish and other organisms that live in the water. Water temperature affects the metabolism, or rate of chemical reactions, in organisms. A higher water temperature can cause the metabolism of fish to increase. But the metabolism of most other organisms in the water will decrease."}

One way is to fix the damage before DNA is transcribed into RNA.\nIf a DNA sequence contains a point mutation, RNA processing enzymes will detect the mistake before mRNA leaves the nucleus. They will remove the mRNA that contains the mutation, and make a new strand from the unmutated DNA sequence. This way, the protein made from the unmutated mRNA will not have the negative effect of the point mutation.\nAnother way to repair DNA is to remove the damaged base and replace it with a correct base. This can be done during replication or transcription.\nSOLUTION: The first codon of a gene is not always AUG.

Respiration is the process by which the body obtains oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.\nThe respiratory system includes the airways, the lungs, and the respiratory muscles.\nThe airways include the nose, the pharynx, the larynx, and the trachea. Air is drawn into the body through the nose or the mouth and passes through the larynx and the trachea into the lungs.\nThe lungs are made up of tubes and alveoli. The tubes are called bronchi. The airways are housed within the lungs. The alveoli are where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs.\nThe respiratory muscles include the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. The diaphragm is a muscle at the base of the lungs. The intercostal muscles are between the ribs. Both muscle groups help to move air in and out of the lungs.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the amount of CO2 in the blood is a sign that respiration has occurred. When the body releases carbon dioxide, the amount of CO2 in the blood increases. This increase triggers the body to respire, which is to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. So, an increase in the amount of CO2 in the blood plays an important role in regulating respiration.\nA decrease in the amount of O2 in the blood also plays an important role in regulating respiration. When the body uses up oxygen, the amount of O2 in the blood decreases. This decrease triggers the body to respire, which is to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.\nA decrease in the plasma pH level also plays an important role in regulating respiration. When the plasma pH level decreases, the body responds to regulate it. Part of this response involves respiration, which is to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.\nStrenuous exercise is not a signal that occurs as a result of respiration. Strenuous exercise is a type of activity. It is not a sign that the body uses to regulate respiration."}

A lake with a pH less than 7 is acidic, and a lake with a pH greater than 7 is alkaline.\nLake B has a pH of 6.0 and is acidic. So, the hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 104 M.\nThe pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain. An acid rain is a type of precipitation that is more acidic than normal rain. Acid rain has a pH less than 5.0.\nBoth lakes will take in carbon dioxide from the air. Carbon dioxide will make the lakes more acidic. So, the pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain."}

These copies are then passed to the cells that are formed by the division.\nIn addition to its role in cell division, chromosomes also play a role in the expression of genes. Genes are the parts of chromosomes that contain the information that affects inherited traits.\nThe chromosomes in cells can be visualized using stains that bind to DNA.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling.

Other mutations, however, may change a gene in a way that affects an organism's traits.\nGenetic drift is the effect of chance on the inheritance of traits. When a population is small, the chance that a particular gene sequence will be affected by random events is higher. As a result, the population's gene pool may change.\nPopulations that are small or isolated may be more likely to experience genetic drift. This can result in a population's gene pool reflecting the effects of genetic drift.\nAdaptive radiation is the rapid evolution of a species into different forms that are adapted to different ecological niches. This process can be fueled by genetic drift and natural selection.\nDisruptive selection is a type of natural selection that favors extreme trait values.

Over time, this can result in the survival of certain traits and the disappearance of others.\nThere are several different ways in which natural selection can act. One way is called directional selection. This type of selection acts in a particular direction or purpose. For example, natural selection might favor organisms with deeper, stronger beaks. This type of selection can lead to the evolution of longer beaks over time.\nAnother way in which natural selection can act is called stochastic selection. This type of selection is not necessarily helpful. It might. or might not, affect the survival of different traits.

If a virus enters a bacterial cell, it may alter the cell's genes. Because viruses can have different alleles, or forms, of their genes, they can bring new alleles into the bacterial cell. This can increase the genetic variation of the bacteria.\nSecond, viral transduction can make the bacterial cell more resistant to predators. If a bacterial cell is infected by a virus, it may be able to survive better when encountered by a predator. This can make the bacterial cell more resistant to predators.\nThird, viral transduction can directly create new species of bacteria. If a bacterial cell is infected by a virus, the two cells may merge to form a single cell. This newly formed cell may have a different combination of alleles than the original two cells. It may also have a different set of viral alleles. These differences can lead to the formation of a new species of bacteria."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The frequency of the heterozygous condition is 40 percent."}

This similarity did not arise from inheritance of traits from a common ancestor. Instead, it arose because organisms in different lines were exposed to similar selective pressures.\nFor example, flight is an expensive trait that requires a lot of energy. Organisms that can fly may have an advantage over those that cannot. As a result, organisms in different lines may evolve the ability to fly.\nSOLUTION: The structure of ATP synthase in the plasma membranes of bacteria is similar to that in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. This similarity is an example of convergent evolution.\nThis means that organisms in different lines were exposed to similar selective pressures and evolved similar traits as a result. But it does not mean that these organisms are closely related or that they inherited traits from a common ancestor."}

Ferns do not have flowers. Instead, they use their fronds to make spores.\nSOLUTION: Ferns are plants. Ferns have small leaves called fronds. Ferns use their fronds to make their own food. Ferns do not have flowers. Instead, they use their fronds to make spores.\nThe first paragraph tells you about a researcher who grew ferns in her laboratory. The researcher noticed that a new variant of ferns had a distinct phenotype. The phenotype is the observable traits of an organism. The observable traits of a fern include its appearance and which substances it makes.\nWhen the researcher bred the original variant of ferns with the new variant, no offspring were produced. This means that the offspring did not have the observable traits of both parents.\nWhen the researcher bred the new variant of ferns, offspring with the observable traits of the new variant resulted. This means that the offspring had the observable traits of at least one parent.\nThe second paragraph tells you about a process called sexual reproduction. This process is how plants make offspring.

{"question": "The average birth weight for human babies is about 3 kg. Which of the following terms best describes this?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "artificial selection"}, {"label": "B", "text": "directional selection"}, {"label": "C", "text": "stabilizing selection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "disruptive selection"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Natural selection acts on organisms, including people. Organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and produce offspring. Offspring inherit the adaptations of their parents. Over time, this process can produce organisms that are better adapted to their environment.\nArms race. An arms race occurs when organisms that can defend themselves against other organisms manage, through natural selection, to become better equipped to defend themselves. This makes them even more effective at defending themselves, which makes them even more successful. The successful organisms produce more offspring that, in turn, reproduce. As a result of this reproduction, the most effective defenses become even more common in the next generation.\nStabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection is a type of natural selection that helps an organism survive and reproduce without causing its traits to change dramatically. For example, the ability to walk on land is a stable adaptation. The soil underfoot does not change quickly. So, organisms that are able to walk on land do not need to change quickly in order to survive.\nDirectional selection. Directional selection is a type of natural selection that favors extreme traits. For example, in the wild, birds that are better at flying may be more likely to survive and reproduce. Their offspring, who are also better at flying, are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, birds with extreme flying ability become more common.\nArtificial selection. Artificial selection is the process by which humans select organisms for specific traits. For example, people have selected dogs to have certain traits, such as short hair and a short nose. This is called artificial selection because it is caused by people.\nDisruptive selection. Disruptive selection is a type of natural selection that favors extreme traits in one direction and extreme traits in the other direction. For example, in a large population of lizards, smaller lizards may be more likely to survive and reproduce. Their offspring are smaller still. Meanwhile, larger lizards may be more likely to survive and reproduce. Their offspring are larger still. Over time, the population may become made up of either all small lizards or all large lizards."}

As they do, their offspring gain genes for survival and reproduction. These genes can include instructions for building adaptations, or traits, that help the organisms survive or reproduce.\nWhen adaptations make an organism more likely to survive or reproduce, those adaptations can be passed down to the organism's offspring. This can lead to a buildup of adaptations in the population. Over time, the adaptations can change the trait values of the population.\nSOLUTION: A new variant with a distinct phenotype may be the result of divergent selection. This means that the different environments affect different traits in the population.\nFor example, ferns that grew in dry areas had a different phenotype than ferns that grew in wet areas. Over time, the different populations of ferns evolved into two different species.\nDivergent selection can happen when different environments affect different traits in a population.\nSOLUTION: The fact that the original phenotype cannot be bred with the new one indicates that the new variant is divergent. This means that the new variant has a different combination of genes than the original variant.\nPolyploidy is when a species has multiples of its normal number of chromosomes. This can change the trait values of a population. But polyploidy does not directly change the way variants are produced.\nEquilibrium is when a population's environment does not change. In an equilibrium environment, most variants will have trait values that are not beneficial. But equilibrium does not necessarily produce new variants.\nAn adaptation is a trait that is beneficial to an organism. An adaptation can include a gene or a group of genes.\nAdaptive radiation is when a single species gives rise to many different species. This can happen when a species expands into new environments and develops new traits.\nThe presence of a distinct phenotype is not necessarily a result of adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiation involves the development of new traits that help an organism survive or reproduce."}

When a scientist has a hypothesis, or a possible explanation, for something that he or she has observed, the scientist can conduct an experiment to test the hypothesis. Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions.\nHow might a scientist design an experiment to answer a specific question? First, the scientist identifies the part of the experiment that will be tested and the part that will measure the effect.\nThe part of the experiment that will be tested usually involves adding, removing, or changing something.\nThe part of the experiment that will measure the effect will observe how the part of the experiment that will be tested affects the result.\nFor example, if a scientist wants to find out whether fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows, the scientist could do the following experiment:\nTest the effect of fertilizer by adding fertilizer to the soil.\nMeasure the effect by counting the number of tomatoes on a fertilized plant and comparing it to the number of tomatoes on an unfertilized plant.\nExperiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you determine what a experiment is designed to test and what it is designed to measure?

This helps to prevent cancer.\nMutations are changes in the instructions in a cell's genes. Some mutations can cause a cell to become cancerous. When too many mutations have accumulated in a cell, that cell can carry out apoptosis.\nCells from different types of organisms respond to different signals when deciding whether to undergo apoptosis.

This phenomenon is called convergent evolution.\nConvergent evolution does not mean that organisms with similar traits are related. Instead, it refers to the independent development of similar traits in organisms that are not closely related.\nMany scientists think that convergent evolution occurs when organisms live under similar evolutionary pressures. For example, organisms that eat similar food or live in similar environments may evolve similar traits.\nOther scientists suggest that convergent evolution is driven by the existence of similar genes. Genes contain information about the proteins that cells use to survive and reproduce. However, genes do not directly cause cells to evolve. Instead, genes contain information about the types of proteins that cells can make. These proteins affect how well an organism can survive and reproduce.\nSome proteins are responsible for complex traits, such as eyes or wings. Because cells use these proteins to survive and reproduce, organisms with similar proteins may evolve similar traits.\nSOLUTION: Biologists interpret similarities like these by using the principle of homology.\nHomology is used to compare bones, organs, or structures that may look different in different organisms. These structures are considered homologous if they evolved from the same ancestral structure.\nThe principle of homology allows scientists to make inferences about the evolutionary history of organisms. For example, if bones in different organisms are homologous, it means that those organisms share a common ancestor."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Tay-Sachs is a disease caused by a recessive allele. This means that the recessive allele for the gene affects the disease. But the recessive allele does not cause the disease itself.\nHeterozygous individuals will show no symptoms. An organism with at least one dominant allele for the Tay-Sachs gene will not have the disease. So, a person with the genotype TT or Tt will not have the disease.\nSpontaneous mutation converts the dominant allele to the recessive form. This process is rare. It changes a dominant allele for a gene into a recessive allele. If this happens in a person's genotype for the Tay-Sachs gene, the person will have the recessive allele's version of the gene. But having the recessive allele does not necessarily cause the disease.\nOccasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual. This effect is called a \"fitness valley.\" If this happens in the Tay-Sachs gene, individuals with the genotype TT or Tt will have increased fitness. But increased fitness does not cause the disease.\nTay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive. An organism with only recessive alleles for the Tay-Sachs gene will not have the disease. So, a person with the genotype ff will not have the disease."}

This addition or deletion shifts the reading frame of the gene, which can change the protein that the gene encodes.\nThe reading frame is the sequence of nucleotides in a gene. Because nucleotides are organized in threes (codons), the position of a nucleotide in a gene determines the amino acid that it encodes.\nThe first nucleotide in a gene determines the amino acid that is encoded at the first position in the protein. The second nucleotide determines the amino acid at the second position, and the third nucleotide determines the amino acid at the third position.\nIf one or more nucleotides are added or deleted from a gene, the reading frame is shifted. For example, consider the gene CAT HAS HIS. The addition of a single nucleotide at the beginning of the gene would shift the reading frame to the right, like this:\nCAT HIS HAS\nThe added nucleotide is underlined.\nNow, the first nucleotide encodes the amino acid at the first position in the protein, and the third nucleotide encodes the amino acid at the third position. The second nucleotide is not used, because four nucleotides are now in the gene.\nThis new protein may have a different function than the protein encoded by the original gene.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether a mutation is a frameshift mutation, you need to determine how many nucleotides are added or deleted from the gene.\nIn this case, one nucleotide is added to the beginning of the gene.

The pattern of bases determines the type of protein that the gene encodes.\nAn important property of DNA is that it is read consecutive. So, for a gene, the nucleotide bases are read in a single direction in order to encode a protein.\nThe direction of DNA reading is called the reading frame. There are three possible reading frames for a gene.\nThe first reading frame is called the forward reading frame. In this reading frame, the nucleotide bases are read in the normal, or forward, direction.\nThe second reading frame is called the reverse reading frame.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The child with type A B blood inherits an IA allele from one parent and an IB allele from the other. The child will carry both A and B glycoproteins on the surface of all red blood cells. This pattern of expression is referred to as codominance.\nTo carry both A and B glycoproteins on the surface of all red blood cells, the child must have both alleles. Each red blood cell has both an A glycoprotein and a B glycoprotein.\nSo, the child's genotype for the blood type gene is AA or BB."}

{"question": "This process couples the production of ATP with the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain by harnessing the driving force created by a proton gradient.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glycolysis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chemiosmosis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fermentation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Calvin cycle"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Calvin cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or the citric acid cycle, is a series of chemical reactions that takes place in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of cells. The Calvin cycle uses the energy from the previous stages of cellular respiration, which is stored in the form of ATP, to produce organic compounds.\nThe first step of the Calvin cycle, acetyl-CoA formation, takes place in the mitochondria. A molecule of acetyl-CoA is produced when a molecule of acetate leaves the mitochondria.\nThe second step of the Calvin cycle, the formation of oxaloacetate, takes place in the cytoplasm. The acetyl-CoA produced in the previous step is now combined with a molecule of GTP to form oxaloacetate.\nThe third step of the Calvin cycle, the formation of a molecule of phosphoglycerate, takes place in the cytoplasm.\nThe fourth step of the Calvin cycle, the formation of a molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate, takes place in the cytoplasm.\nThe fifth step of the Calvin cycle, the formation of a molecule of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, takes place in the cytoplasm.\nThe sixth step of the Calvin cycle, the formation of a molecule of 2-phosphoglycerate, takes place in the cytoplasm.\nThe seventh step of the Calvin cycle, the formation of a molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate, takes place in the cytoplasm.\nThe eighth and final step of the Calvin cycle, the formation of a molecule of pyruvate, takes place in the cytoplasm.\nThe pyruvate can be converted to organic compounds such as glucose, which can be used as fuel or stored for later use.\nSOLUTION: Chemiosmosis is the process that harnesses the energy of electrons moving through the electron transport chain. This process couples the production of ATP with the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain by harnessing the driving force created by a proton gradient.\nGlycolysis, fermentation, and the Calvin cycle all produce chemical compounds that can be used as fuel, but they do not directly generate ATP."}
