A potentiometer can be used to measure voltage by placing the potentiometer in the circuit and adjusting it so that the voltage is equal through the potentiometer and through a resistor of known value.\nDirect measurement using a voltmeter: To measure voltage directly, place the voltmeter in the circuit so that the voltmeter measures the voltage between two points.\nSOLUTION: The potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it loads the circuit moderately.\nWhen a potentiometer is used to measure voltage, the potentiometer is placed in the circuit so that the potentiometer measures the voltage between two points. The potentiometer does not load, or use, the voltage that is measured. Instead, the potentiometer uses a resistor to create a voltage difference that is equal to the voltage between the two points. This technique does not use the voltage that is measured, so the measurement is not affected by the amount of current drawn from the circuit.\nDirect measurement using a voltmeter measures the voltage between two points by placing the voltmeter in the circuit. To do this, the voltmeter must use the voltage that is measured. So, the measurement is affected by the amount of current drawn from the circuit."}

When the V/f value is decreased, the motor speed decreases.\nThe choice of control mode depends on the application.\nConstant torque operation is achieved by maintaining a constant V/f value. The constant V/f value is determined by the torque required.\nReduced magnetic loss is achieved by adjusting the V/f value to be as low as possible.

Laminations can be used to reduce eddy current losses in a machine.\nEddy current losses occur when a conductor has a changing magnetic field around it. The changing magnetic field induces an electric current in the conductor. This electric current causes a changing magnetic field in the conductor. This second changing magnetic field induces another electric current in the conductor. These electric currents produce a force that opposes the motion of the conductor.\nA common way to reduce eddy current losses is to make the conductor thicker. But if the conductor is thick, it will also have a large hysteresis loss.\nHysteresis losses occur when the magnetic field around a conductor changes. When the magnetic field changes, the direction of the current in the conductor changes. This movement of the current produces a resistive loss.\nA conductor with laminations has a smaller cross-sectional area than a solid conductor. So, the magnetic field around a conductor with laminations changes less than the magnetic field around a solid conductor. Less change in the magnetic field means less hysteresis loss.\nCopper losses are the losses that occur when the electric current in a conductor moves through the resistance of the conductor. Copper losses are not affected by laminations.\nSOLUTION: Thin laminations are used in a machine in order to reduce eddy current losses. Eddy current losses are caused by a changing magnetic field around a conductor. Laminations reduce the change in the magnetic field around a conductor. So, thinner laminations reduce eddy current losses."}

This means that the voltage and current are the same. So, the power measured by a wattmeter connected across a pure resistor is equal to the power input into the resistor.\nWhen an object is a pure capacitor or a pure inductor, the power factor is 0. This means that the voltage and current are different. So, the power measured by a wattmeter connected across a pure capacitor or a pure inductor is 0.\nIf an object is a combination of a resistor, a capacitor, and an inductor, the power factor is not 1. The power factor is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1.\nThe power factor can be different from 1 when the current is not the same as the voltage.

Each device in the system receives the same voltage, but the current through each device is determined by the resistance of that device.\nA delta connected system is made up of three power sources that are connected to form a triangular pattern. Each device in the system receives the same voltage, but the current through each device is determined by the resistance of that device.\nSo, the power of an equivalent delta connected system is equal to the power of the single power source in the star connected system."}

A network can contain elements that are either linear or nonlinear.\nThe superposition theorem states that if all the elements in a network are linear, then the superposition theorem holds. This means that the network behaves as if all the elements were connected in series.\nAn impulse is a function that is zero for t < 0 and infinite for t \u2265 0. An impulse is not a signal, but it can be used to model a signal that is zero for t < 0 and infinite for t \u2265 0.\nIf the excitation is a DC signal, the network behaves as if all the elements were connected in series.\nIf the excitation is an AC signal, the network behaves as if all the elements were connected in parallel.\nSOLUTION: The superposition theorem holds when the excitation is a DC signal. This is because the network behaves as if all the elements were connected in series.\nThe superposition theorem does not hold when the excitation is an AC signal. This is because the network behaves as if all the elements were connected in parallel.\nSo, the correct answer is DC only."}

The wait states are always inserted between.\nThe 8086/8088 bus cycle is made up of four clock cycles: T1, T2, T3, and T4. These four cycles are referred to as the bus cycle. The 8086/8088 processor also uses wait states. A wait state is a clock cycle in which the processor is waiting for a memory cycle to complete. Wait states are inserted between the bus cycle phases. The processor does not run any instructions during a wait state.\nThe length of the bus cycle is the total number of clock cycles it takes to complete the bus cycle. The length of the bus cycle is longer than just the four bus cycle phases because of the wait states.\nSOLUTION: The length of the bus cycle is longer than just the four bus cycle phases because of the wait states.
