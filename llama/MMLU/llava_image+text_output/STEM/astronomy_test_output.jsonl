A white dwarf is the remnant of a star. It is formed when a star has used up all of its fuel.\nA type-Ia supernova occurs in a binary system. A binary system is made up of two stars. One of the stars is a white dwarf. The other star is a large star.\nThe large star gives material to the white dwarf. The material makes the white dwarf grow heavier. Until the white dwarf becomes so heavy that it explodes.\nA type-Ia supernova produces high amounts of X-rays.\nType-Ia supernovas produce gamma-ray bursts.\nA gamma-ray burst is a brief burst of gamma rays. Gamma rays are high-energy light.\nGamma-ray bursts are produced by certain types of supernovas. They are produced by type-Ia supernovas.

So, when sunlight enters the atmosphere, its short wavelength components are scattered more often than long wavelength components. This makes the sky appear blue."}

The Sun's ultraviolet radiation can break apart water molecules. Hydrogen and oxygen, the atoms that make up water, can then escape into space.\nSome water was lost when Mars was young and had a weaker magnetic field. The magnetic field could not hold onto the hydrogen gas that was generated by the water. The hydrogen gas could escape into space.\nSome water was lost when Mars had a thicker atmosphere. The atmosphere could trap water vapor. But a thicker atmosphere also allowed more ultraviolet radiation to reach the surface. The radiation could break apart water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen.

It uses the radioactive decay of materials such as uranium and potassium. Scientists can calculate how long ago a rock formed based on the ratio of the radioactive isotopes to their stable isotopes.\nThe Moon's surface is heavily eroded, and the Earth's surface is not.

Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?\nThe number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.\nNow look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.\nThere are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.\nThere are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.\nSOLUTION: Eratosthenes estimated the size of Earth in 240 B.C. by comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\nHe chose cities that were about 700 miles apart. One city was at the ground and the other city was on a mountain.\nBy looking up, you can see the Sun is higher in the sky at the mountain city than at the ground city.

They used instruments on board the MESSENGER spacecraft to study the poles.\nOne interesting fact about Mercury's poles is that they are covered in water-ice. It is possible that water-ice may also be buried beneath the surface of the poles. This water-ice could be a resource for future explorers.\nAnother interesting fact about Mercury's poles is that they have shadowed regions. These shadowed regions are called polar craters.

A model is a simplified explanation of a process.\nFor example, scientists observe that Earth orbits the sun, but they cannot observe the sun orbiting Earth. They can observe that the sun appears to move across the sky, but this observation does not explain the movement. So, scientists use the model that the Earth orbits the sun to explain this observation.\nModels can be tested by making predictions. A model's prediction must be tested to confirm that the model is correct.\nFor example, the model that the Earth orbits the sun predicts that Mars will appear on the opposite side of the sun after 6 months. This prediction was tested by observing Mars and the sun over several months. The observation was compared to the model's prediction. The model was correct: Mars appeared on the opposite side of the sun after 6 months."}

Gaps in the main asteroid belt were first noticed by William H. Pickering in 1892. There are now known to be two gaps, which are located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.\nThese gaps are called Kirkwood gaps, after Daniel Kirkwood, who studied the Orbit of the asteroid Dactyl. Kirkwood noticed that there was a pattern to the locations of the gaps. He found that the gaps always occur at intervals of 17.6 years, or multiples of 17.6 years.\nThe table below shows the orbits of the planets and the locations of the Kirkwood gaps. The columns show the distances from the sun, in astronomical units (AU). The rows show the positions of the planets.\nThe values in the table are a multiple of 17.6 years. The other columns show the distances in AU.\nSOLUTION: To determine which Kirkwood gap a asteroid would orbit with a period twice that of Mars, use the table above and look for the distance of 1.68 AU.

Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?\nThe number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.\nNow look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.\nThere are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.\nThere are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.\nSOLUTION: Weigh is a verb. It means to measure how much something weighs.\nThe correct answer is a kilogram of bricks as measured on Earth.\nA kilogram is a unit of mass. Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.\nA brick is made of clay and sand. A brick does not have a specific mass. But the bricks on Earth are all made to be about the same size. So, a brick is about the same mass as a paper clip.\nA kilogram is much heavier than a paper clip. A kilogram is made up of 1,000 grams.

For example, the atmosphere of Venus is mostly carbon dioxide, but the atmosphere of Earth is mostly nitrogen and oxygen.\nSOLUTION: Uranus and Neptune have blue methane clouds. But Jupiter and Saturn do not. Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn. So, methane exists as a gas in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.\nMethane did not exist in the solar nebula at the radii of Jupiter and Saturn when the planets formed. So, Jupiter and Saturn did not form with methane.\nThe relative slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.

{"question": "Why do jovian planets bulge around the equator that is have a \"squashed\" appearance?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Their large systems of moons and rings gravitationally attract the mass around the equator more."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are much more massive than the terrestrial planets."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their internal heat sources exert a pressure against the sides of the planets."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A planet's equator is the line located at 0\u00b0 latitude. For many planets, the equator is the line around the planet's middle that is the same distance from the planet's center as the line that circles the planet's surface once.\nThe volume of a planet is calculated by multiplying the planet's radius by the planet's circumference. For a planet with a spherical shape, the radius is the distance from the center of the planet to the surface of the planet. So, the volume of a spherical planet is given by the formula:\nVolume = (4/3) \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 r^3,\nwhere r is the planet's radius.\nSOLUTION: The first step is to understand that the volume of a planet is given by the formula above. The volume of a planet is equal to the volume of a space that is larger than the planet. So, the volume of a jovian planet is greater than the volume of a terran planet.\nJovian planets are much larger than terran planets. A jovian planet's equator is much farther from the center of the planet than a terran planet's equator. So, the volume of a jovian planet is much greater than the volume of a terran planet.\nA jovian planet's rapid rotation means that the planet is flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. The bulge at the equator is more pronounced than the bulge at the poles. The material in the bulge at the equator is pulled outward by the planet's rapid rotation.\nThe internal heat of a planet is spread out by its rotation. As a result, the material in a jovian planet's bulge at the equator is pressed outward. The material in a jovian planet's bulge at the equator is not pressed inward.\nThe moons and rings of a planet attract matter. But the attraction of the matter around the equator is stronger than the attraction of the matter around the poles. So, the matter around the equator is pulled outward more than the matter around the poles."}

So, Jupiter generates its internal heat by contracting.\nJupiter is made of gas, so it does not have a solid surface. Instead, Jupiter has layers. The atmosphere is the layer closest to Jupiter's surface. The mantle is the next layer in. The mantle is made of rocks. The core is the innermost layer.\nJupiter's core is a solid. It is made of rocks and ice. Jupiter's atmosphere is the layer closest to the planet. So, Jupiter's atmosphere is colder than its core.\nSOLUTION: To generate internal heat, Jupiter does not need to contract. Only the core of Jupiter is contracting. So, Jupiter generates its internal heat by contracting."}

The region on a planet that is closest to the planet's star is called the planet's surface. The region that is farthest from the star is called the planet's atmosphere.\nThe temperature on a planet's surface can get higher as you move closer to the star. The temperature can also get higher as the star becomes brighter. So, the habitable zone is the region around a star where the temperature on a planet's surface could be suitable for liquid water. Liquid water is essential for life as we know it.\nSOLUTION: The habitable zone is the region around a star where the temperature on a planet's surface could be suitable for liquid water.\nScientists use a range of temperatures to define the habitable zone. The range goes from about -10\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C.\nSo, the habitable zone is the region around a star where the temperature on a planet's surface could be within this range."}

Like optical telescopes, radio telescopes come in reflecting and receiving types.\nA reflecting radio telescope uses a parabolic mirror to focus radio waves. The parabolic mirror focuses radio waves by reflecting them off of its curve. The focal point is where the parabolic mirror reflects the radio waves. A detector can be located at the focal point to detect the radio waves.\nA receiving radio telescope is designed to detect radio waves. It does not use a parabolic mirror. Instead, it uses a wide-area detector to pick up radio waves.\nSOLUTION: The Green Bank Telescope has the largest parabolic antenna. The Green Bank Telescope is a reflecting radio telescope. It uses a 100-meter-wide parabolic mirror to focus radio waves.\nThe Arecibo Telescope has a dish-shaped antenna, not a parabolic mirror. The Arecibo Telescope is a receiving radio telescope.\nThe Effelsberg Telescope has a 70-meter-wide parabolic mirror. So, the Effelsberg Telescope has the largest parabolic antenna of the four.\nThe Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope has a 70-meter-wide parabolic mirror.
