The amount of rotational inertia for an object is determined by its mass and distance from the axis of rotation.\nAngular momentum is a measure of the object's rotational inertia. For a system of objects, the total angular momentum is determined by the sum of the rotational inertias of each object and the distance from the axis of rotation to each object.\nIf all the mass in a spinning system is concentrated at the axis of rotation, the system has maximum rotational inertia. In this case, the system's angular momentum is determined by the distance from the axis of rotation to the mass.\nWhen a spinning system contracts in the absence of an external torque, its rotational speed increases and its angular momentum decreases. This is because the system's rotational inertia remains unchanged, but the distance from the axis of rotation to the mass decreases.\nSOLUTION: When a spinning system contracts, the distance from the axis of rotation to the mass decreases.

In 1915, Einstein's theory of general relativity predicted that gravitational waves should exist.\nThe first detection of gravitational waves was in 2015. A machine called LIGO was built to detect gravitational waves. LIGO is a laser interferometer. It measures the distance between two mirrors by comparing the time it takes for light to travel along the two paths.\nIf a gravitational wave passes through Earth, the distance between the two mirrors will change. LIGO can detect this change.\nSOLUTION: A light-year is a unit of distance. It is the distance light travels in one year.\nWhen a star explodes, the explosion sends waves of pressure through space. These waves are called shock waves.\nThe explosion also creates gravitational waves. The explosion causes the star to lose mass. As the star loses mass, it creates a disturbance in space-time. This disturbance propagates through space as gravitational waves.\nThe speed of gravitational waves is unknown. But because they are created by the acceleration of massive objects, they do not travel at the speed of light.\nSo, if a star that is 20 light-years from Earth explodes, gravitational waves from the explosion would reach Earth in less than 20 years."}

A law is an empirical relationship that describes how something in nature occurs. The law does not necessarily explain why the relationship exists. For example, Coulomb\u2019s law is a law that describes the electrical force between two charges. It does not, however, explain why this force exists. A principle is a fundamental truth that describes the way something in nature operates. Principles can sometimes be explained by other principles. For example, the law of conservation of mass is a principle that describes the way matter behaves. It can be explained by the principle of conservation of mass, which says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. An law or principle can include other laws or principles. For example, Coulomb\u2019s law includes the law of conservation of mass.\nSOLUTION: The metal detectors people walk through at airports operate via Faraday\u2019s law. Faraday\u2019s law describes the connection between a change in a magnetic field and an electric current. It is included in Ohm\u2019s law, which describes the connection between voltage, current, and resistance."}

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\nSOLUTION: Fission and fusion are nuclear reactions. Nuclear reactions are physical changes. No new matter is created in a nuclear reaction. So, the mass remains unchanged."}

Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object.\nBuoyant force is a force that makes an object start moving upward.\nImagine being able to push an object with a force. This force can make the object start moving upward. The buoyant force is that force.\nBuoyant force is different from other types of forces, such as the force that makes you move forward when you walk.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical reaction, the chemical bonds in different molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical reaction are determined by the types of molecules that link together.\nEnergy can be moved from one place to another by moving matter. One way to do this is by moving matter up a slope. A push or a pull can move matter up a slope.\nWhen matter is moved up a slope, its kinetic energy increases. Its potential energy decreases.\nThe kinetic energy of matter is determined by its mass and speed.\nThe mass of a object is determined by its weight and the mass of the object before it is moved.\nSOLUTION: Chain reactions in a fission reactor are caused by ejected neutrons.\nWhen uranium-235 captures a neutron, the atomic nucleus breaks into two smaller nuclei. One of these is the nucleus of a lighter atom, which is ejected at high speed.\nThe ejected neutrons can link together with other atoms in the reactor to start a chain reaction."}

If it does not have sufficient tangential velocity, it will fall into Earth.\nA satellite in orbit is in mechanical equilibrium. This means that the forces on the satellite are balanced. The main pull of Earth gravity acts on the satellite, pulling it down. But the satellite has a tangential velocity that acts on the satellite, pushing it up. These forces are balanced, so the satellite is in mechanical equilibrium."}
