When something is rotated around a fulcrum, the distance between the fulcrum and the object makes a difference to the object's sense of balance.\nIf the distance between the fulcrum and an object is changed, the object will move to rebalance itself. Moving the fulcrum or moving the object's pivot point is called a translation. Translations change the distance between the fulcrum and the object.\nWhen the distance between the fulcrum and an object is changed, the object will move to rebalance itself. This is because the distance between the fulcrum and each object is equal to the distance between the fulcrum and the opposite object.\nFor example, consider a see-saw with fulcrum O. One person sits on the left side of the fulcrum, and the other person sits on the right side of the fulcrum. The left person is lighter than the right person.\nIf the left person moves to a different spot on the see-saw, the distance between the fulcrum and the left person will change. But the distance between the fulcrum and the right person will change in the same way. For every movement of the left person, the right person moves in the opposite direction but the same distance.\nThis movement of the right person is called a translation. Translations don't affect the see-saw's sense of balance.\nOnly when the distance between the fulcrum and an object is different from the distance between the fulcrum and the opposite object will the object move to a different balance point.\nFor example, if the left person moves closer to the fulcrum, the distance between the fulcrum and the left person is less than the distance between the fulcrum and the right person. So, the see-saw will tip toward the left.\nIf the right person moves farther from the fulcrum, the distance between the fulcrum and the right person is more than the distance between the fulcrum and the left person. So, the see-saw will tip toward the right.\nSOLUTION: To balance a see-saw, you need to keep the distance between the fulcrum and each person the same as the distance between the fulcrum and the opposite person.\nIf you move the boy to half his original distance from the fulcrum, the distance between the fulcrum and the boy is half the distance between the fulcrum and the girl. This is different from the distance between the fulcrum and the opposite person. So, the see-saw will not be balanced.\nIf you move the girl to double her original distance from the fulcrum, the distance between the fulcrum and the girl is double the distance between the fulcrum and the boy. This is different from the distance between the fulcrum and the opposite person. So, the see-saw will not be balanced.\nIf you move the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy, the distance between the fulcrum and the boy is half the distance between the fulcrum and the girl. This is different from the distance between the fulcrum and the opposite person. So, the see-saw will not be balanced.\nAllowing a second girl of mass m to join the first would double the mass of the girl. So, the distance between the fulcrum and the girl would be twice the distance between the fulcrum and the boy. This is different from the distance between the fulcrum and the opposite person. So, the see-saw will not be balanced."}

An object with more mass has more angular inertia and resists changes to its angular velocity more than an object with less mass.\nFriction is a force that resists changes to the velocity of an object. When the friction force acts on an object, the object's velocity changes. The amount of change in the object's velocity depends on the size of the friction force and the size of the object's inertia.\nSOLUTION: The sphere comes to rest when the friction force is equal in magnitude to the sum of the sphere's static friction and its kinetic friction.

When the two waves meet, they are in phase, and the string vibrates the most. If the two waves are out of phase, the string vibrates the least. The point at which the two waves meet is called a node. When the waves are in phase, the string vibrates with its greatest amplitude at a node.\nWhen a string is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave, standing waves are not created. The pattern of vibration is the same at both ends of the string.\nThe wavelength of a wave is the distance between two consecutive nodes.

The wave's height may be the same, but its intensity is still lower."}
{"question": "Physics students are checking the constant acceleration equations of kinematics by measuring the velocity of a tennis ball that is dropped and falls 6 meters and then passes through a photogate. The predicted velocity is 20% above the velocity measured by the photogate. Which of the following best describes the cause of the large percent difference?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The ball changes its shape while falling."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The acceleration of the balls varies with the velocity."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When an object's velocity changes, its acceleration changes as well. The size of the acceleration is called the object's local acceleration.\nThe direction of the local acceleration is always toward the object's current velocity. This means that the local acceleration is toward the higher velocity when the object's velocity is increasing, and toward the lower velocity when the object's velocity is decreasing.\nSOLUTION: The ball's velocity changes by 20% while it is falling. This means that the ball's acceleration changes by 20% as well.\nThe acceleration of gravity does not vary significantly over the distance of the fall. So, the large percent difference is not due to a change in the acceleration of gravity.\nAir resistance increases the acceleration of the ball. But the effect is small over the distance of the fall. So, the large percent difference is not due to an increase in air resistance.\nThe velocity of the ball is 20% higher than the expected value. So, the local acceleration is toward the higher velocity. This means that the local acceleration varies with the velocity.\nThe size of the large percent difference tells you that the local acceleration varies with the velocity. The acceleration is 20% higher than expected."}
{"question": "Mercury orbits the sun in about one-fifth of an Earth year. If 1 AU is defined as the distance from the Earth to the sun, what is the approximate distance between Mercury and the sun?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "(1/25) AU"}, {"label": "B", "text": "(1/9) AU"}, {"label": "C", "text": "(1/5) AU"}, {"label": "D", "text": "(1/3) AU"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Our solar system is made up of eight planets and the sun. The planets orbit, or go around, the sun.\nThe orbit of each planet is different. For example, it takes Jupiter 11.8 years to make one orbit around the sun. It takes Saturn 29.4 years.\nA year is the time it takes for the earth to make one orbit around the sun. So, one orbit of the earth is called one year.\nSOLUTION: Mercury orbits the sun in about one-fifth of an earth year. So, it takes Mercury one-fifth of a year to make one orbit around the sun.\nTo find the approximate distance between Mercury and the sun, use the formula:\nDistance = Orbit time\nThe orbit time is one-fifth of a year. The distance between Mercury and the sun is therefore (1/5) AU."}
{"question": "The Gravitron is a carnival ride that looks like a large cylinder. People stand inside the cylinder against the wall as it begins to spin. Eventually, it is rotating fast enough that the floor can be removed without anyone falling. Given then the coefficient of friction between a person\u2019s clothing and the wall is \u03bc, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "\u03bcv^2/(rg)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "r^2v^2/(\u03bcg)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "rg/(\u03bcv^2)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: An object's mass tells you its weight. For a constant force, the greater the mass of an object, the slower it will accelerate. So, if the masses of two objects are different, the object with the greater mass will accelerate more slowly than the object with the smaller mass.\nFor an object on a frictionless surface, the relationship between the force of gravity and the acceleration of the object is described by the equation below.\nIf the greatest mass that a person can be is 250 pounds, for example, the person's acceleration will be smaller by a factor of 250 than if the person had a mass of 50 pounds.\nSOLUTION: To safely go on the Gravitron, a person's mass cannot be greater than the greatest mass that a person can be. The greatest mass that a person can be is 250 pounds.\nIf the floor can be removed without anyone falling, the Gravitron is rotating fast enough. So, the greatest mass that a person can be is 250 pounds."}
