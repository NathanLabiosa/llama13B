Some processes change the temperature of the substance.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the temperature of a substance changes, the substance will either heat up or cool down.\nA change in temperature will change the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and the temperature of the substance is described by the equation:\nKE = 3/2 N k T\nWhere KE is the average kinetic energy of the particles, N is the number of particles, k is a constant, and T is the temperature.\nThe total energy of the substance will change if the temperature changes.

An unpaired electron is an electron that is not shared by two atoms. An atomic nucleus with an unpaired electron is called a radical.\nWhen an unpaired electron is excited by a certain type of radiation, it can move to a higher energy level. When the electron falls back to a lower energy level, it can give off energy in the form of radiation. This radiation is called paramagnetic radiation, or PMR.\nThe energy of the PMR is specific to the type of radical. So, the PMR can be used to identify the type of radical.\nThe energy difference between two energy levels of a radical is called its hyperfine structure. The hyperfine structure is caused by the magnetic interactions between the unpaired electron and the nuclear spins of the atoms.\nThe number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a radical is an indication of the radical's hyperfine structure. The EPR spectrum can have one line, or it can have multiple lines.\nSOLUTION: Nitronyl nitroxides are stable radicals with two equivalent nitrogen nuclei. The unpaired electron is coupled to both nuclei.\nIn a rigid nitronyl nitroxide diradical with J << a, the two nuclei are not coupled to each other. So, the two nuclei cannot affect each other's magnetic properties.\nSince the two nuclei are not coupled to each other, the EPR spectrum will have two lines.

It varies in direct proportion to the magnetic field strength and inversely proportion to the mass of the hydrogen nuclei. The units are Hz.\nThe 1H chemical shift is the difference between the 1H Larmor frequency and the resonance frequency of the hydrogen nuclei in the solute. The resonance frequency depends on the magnetic field strength and the mass of the hydrogen nuclei. The units are ppm.\nThe 1H Larmor frequency of benzene exceeds that of trifluoroacetic acid by 1.656 kHz on a 400 MHz spectrometer.

When a molecule absorbs a photon, its electrons are promoted to higher energy levels. The molecule can return to its ground state by emitting a photon, a process called fluorescence.\nFluorescence can be used to detect molecules that are not present at high enough concentrations to be detected by other methods. This is because the release of a photon is a rare event, and the photon can be absorbed by a surrounding medium. This makes the fluorescence detectable.\nSOLUTION: Spin trapping is often used to detect free radical intermediates because the steady state concentration of free radical intermediates is often too low to enable direct detection by EPR.\nDirect detection by EPR requires a high concentration of free radical intermediates.

The chemical shift of tetramethylsilane in water is around 0.00 ppm, and in D2O, it is around 5.00 ppm.\nMost organic compounds do not contain silicon atoms, so they do not have the same chemical shift as tetramethylsilane.\nTetramethylsilane has a 1H spectrum that is a singlet.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. The links between atoms in a molecule can pull on each other. This pulling is called a chemical bond.\nThe strength of a chemical bond depends on the links between the atoms. The links can be strong or weak. A strong link forms when two atoms pull together. A weak link forms when two atoms do not pull together as much.\nThe energy of a molecule is affected by the strength of the chemical bonds. The energy levels of a molecule are the different levels of energy that a molecule can have.\nThere are many different energy levels in a molecule. The first energy level has the lowest energy. The second energy level has a higher energy than the first energy level. The third energy level has a higher energy than the second energy level.

When substances interact with light, that is, when substances absorb or scatter light, energy is transferred to the substances. This interaction can give information about the substances.\nRaman spectroscopy uses a change in the wavelength of light to identify substances. The change in wavelength is called Raman scattering. When light is scattered by a substance, the wavelength of the light is shifted.\nInfrared spectroscopy is also a light-scattering technique. In infrared spectroscopy, the wavelength of the light is shifted by the absorption of the light.\nNuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy uses magnetic fields and radio waves to examine the chemical environment of nuclear magnets.\nUltraviolet-visible spectroscopy is a technique that uses light in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum.

These reactions involve the transfer of electrons between the metal ion and another molecule.\nThe metal ion can be involved in a change of state, such as:\noxidation: an increase in the number of electrons\nreduction: a decrease in the number of electrons\nSome metal ions can have multiple stable oxidation states, or numbers of electrons. For example, iron can have ferric and ferrous oxidation states.\nWhen a metal ion in an enzyme has at least two stable oxidation states, it can be part of a redox enzyme catalyst. These metal ions can be in different oxidation states in different enzymes.\nSOLUTION: Cu, Fe, Co are metals that can be found in the active site of redox enzymes.\nZn, Ca, Ga are not metals that can be found in the active site of redox enzymes.\nSr, Ga, Mg are not metals that can be found in the active site of redox enzymes.\nNa, Ba, Al are not metals that can be found in the active site of redox enzymes."}

The property of an atom is called its electron affinity. An atom's electron affinity depends on the atom's ability to attract electrons.\nAn atom's electron affinity can change when it gains electrons. An atom's electron affinity is lowest when the atom gains the fewest electrons.\nScientists can predict whether an atom will gain or lose electrons by looking at the atom's electron affinity. If an atom's electron affinity is low, the atom will gain electrons. If an atom's electron affinity is high, the atom will lose electrons.\nSOLUTION: The best way to determine which atom has the lowest electron affinity is to look up the electron affinity of each atom.\nThe electron affinity of oxygen is -54.9 kJ/mol. The electron affinity of silicon is -4.95 kJ/mol. The electron affinity of fluorine is -91 kJ/mol. The electron affinity of calcium is -120.9 kJ/mol.\nSo, the atom with the lowest electron affinity is oxygen."}

Each type of environment can cause either one line or two lines to appear in the spectrum.\nAn EPR spectrum has three lines:\nThe first line appears when the electron spin is up.\nThe second line appears when the electron spin is down.\nThese two lines do not show up on the spectrum.\nSo, the number of lines in the spectrum can be 1 or 2.\nSOLUTION: The chemical environment of the electron spin in dimethylnitroxide involves two vinyl groups. Each vinyl group causes one line to appear in the EPR spectrum. So, the spectrum will have one line."}

The higher their bond dissociation energy, the more strongly the Lewis acid and Lewis base bond to form a substance.\nSOLUTION: ZnCl2 is a Lewis acid. It can accept electrons.\nZnCl2 behaves as a Lewis acid because its zinc atom can accept electrons. The two chlorine atoms bond to the zinc atom to form zinc chloride.\nBeCl2 is a Lewis acid.
