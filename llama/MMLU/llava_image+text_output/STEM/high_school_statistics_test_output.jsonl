When conducting a hypothesis test, you use data from a sample to make an inference about a population.\nThe null hypothesis is the hypothesis that the researcher is testing.

The standard deviation of a set of numbers is a measure of the spread of the numbers.\nIf the standard deviation of a set of numbers is small, it means that the numbers are clustered tightly around the mean. If the standard deviation is large, it means that the numbers are scattered widely around the mean.\nThe standard deviation can be calculated in a few different ways. One way is to use the formula:\nIf x is the mean of a set of numbers, and s is the standard deviation of the set, then s = \u03c3 / \u221an, where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of a sample of n numbers.\nIf the mean and standard deviation of a set of numbers are known, the standard deviation can be used to calculate a range of values within which a random selection of numbers from the set is likely to fall.\nFor example, if the mean of a set of numbers is 10 and the standard deviation is 2, then a random selection of a single number from the set is likely to be within 2 numbers of the mean. So, the number could be anywhere from 8 to 12.\nA sample standard deviation is an estimate of the standard deviation of a population. A sample standard deviation can be calculated from a sample of numbers by using the formula:\nIf x is the mean of a sample of numbers, and s is the sample standard deviation, then s = \u03c3 / \u221an, where \u03c3 is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\nThe sample standard deviation can be used to calculate a range of values within which the actual population standard deviation is likely to fall. For example, if the sample standard deviation is 2 and the sample size is 40, then the population standard deviation is likely to be between 0.5 and 4.\nSOLUTION: The new appraised values will be $125,000 + $5,000. The standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city will be larger, but by how much?\nThe standard deviation of the current appraised values is $23,000. To decide how much the standard deviation will increase, you need to know how the new appraised values will affect the spread of the values.\nBecause the new appraised values will be $5,000 higher than the current appraised values, the new standard deviation will be larger than the current standard deviation. By how much?\nThe new standard deviation will be larger by the same amount that the mean is larger.

For example, a two-stage sample may be taken by first selecting a random sample of schools and then selecting a random sample of students from each school.\nSOLUTION: The associate picks four names from the list of customers whose names begin with A, and then repeats this process for each remaining name. So, each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey.\nThe associate's procedure is not a simple random sample, because customers are not selected randomly from the entire population. Instead, the associate picks names from a list of customers whose names begin with A, and then repeats this process for each remaining name."}

You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.\nFor example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:\nYou grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, it is called the treatment.\nThe other group of pea plants is grown in soil without fertilizer and is used as a control. The control group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil.\nBy comparing the results from the treatment to the results from the control, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.\nExperiments can have different types of variations, or ways in which the variables change. The type of variation in an experiment is called its design. Some common types of experiment designs are:\nRandomized design. The groups are determined by random chance, so that the experiments are equal. For example, imagine you want to investigate whether red or blue shirts affect mood. You could investigate this question with a randomized design by first randomizing the colors and then assigning shirts to people.\nSelf-control design. The groups are determined by comparing the result of one group to the result of another group. For example, imagine you want to investigate whether adding fertilizer to soil affects pea plant height. You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. The result of this group is used to compare with the result of another group grown in soil without fertilizer.\nCross-over design. The groups get the opposite treatments at different times. For example, imagine you want to investigate whether drinking coffee before a test helps you do better. You could investigate this question with a cross-over design by having some people drink coffee before a test and others drink water. Then, you could switch the treatments and investigate whether the opposite treatment helps.\nFactorial design. The experiment has more than one treatment, and the groups receive all of the treatments in a particular order. For example, imagine you want to investigate whether adding fertilizer to soil affects pea plant height and whether watering plants twice as much affects height. You could investigate these questions with a factorial design by growing groups of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and watering some groups more than others.\nSOLUTION: This experiment has a completely randomized design. It has two sex groups, which are determined by random chance.\nSOLUTION: There are three types of paint and two sex groups, giving a total of six treatment combinations in this experiment."}

Assuming that the probability of any cyclone becoming a hurricane is independent of what happens to any other cyclone, if there are five cyclones in one year, what is the probability that at least three become hurricanes?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "0.313"}, {"label": "B", "text": "0.345"}, {"label": "C", "text": "0.586"}, {"label": "D", "text": "0.658"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A random event is an event that happens by chance. The probability of a random event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nFor example, the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair die is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of 6's on the die / total number of sides = 1 / 6\nThe probability of an event happening is 100% if the event is sure to happen. And the probability of an event happening is 0% if the event is impossible to happen.\nFor example, the probability of rolling a 1 on a fair die is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of 1's on the die / total number of sides = 1 / 6\nThis fraction is not 100%. So, the probability of rolling a 1 on a fair die is 0%.\nSOLUTION: The table below shows the number of tropical cyclones and the number of hurricanes each year. The table also shows the probability of a cyclone becoming a hurricane, based on the average rates of the past 120 years.\nYear | Number of tropical cyclones | Number of hurricanes | Probability of becoming a hurricane\n1886 | 7 | 5 | 0.714\n1900 | 11 | 8 | 0.727\n1920 | 14 | 11 | 0.786\n1940 | 14 | 12 | 0.857\n1960 | 18 | 14 | 0.778\n1980 | 28 | 21 | 0.750\n2000 | 32 | 17 | 0.500\nThe first step in solving this problem is to determine the number of ways at least three cyclones can become hurricanes. At least three cyclones must become hurricanes. So, there must be at least 3 hurricanes.\nThere are 5.1 hurricanes per year. So, there must be 5.1 hurricanes per year.\nThe second step is to determine the number of equally likely outcomes. There are 5.1 hurricanes per year. So, there must be 5.1 hurricanes per year.\nThe probability of at least three cyclones becoming hurricanes is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = 3 (number of hurricanes) / 5.1 (number of hurricanes per year)\n= 3 / 5.1\n= 0.586"}

One group receives the new treatment, while the other group receives the old treatment.\nA two-proportion z-test is the correct test to use when you want to determine if the proportions of experiments in the two groups are significantly different. Proportion is a value between 0 and 1, and it represents the number of experiments in one group that have a certain outcome, divided by the number of experiments in both groups.\nFor example, if 3 out of 4 experiments in one group have a certain outcome, and 2 out of 4 experiments in both groups have that outcome, the proportion of experiments in one group that have the outcome is 3/4, and the proportion in both groups is 2/4.\nA two-sample t-test is the correct test to use when you want to determine if the means of two populations are significantly different.

An association is a relationship between a variable and a outcome. A factor is a variable that participates in an association.\nFor example, consider an experiment with two variables, x and y. Suppose that there is a positive association between x and y. That is, as x increases, y also increases. We can describe this association using the phrase \"as x increases, y increases.\"\nA factor is a variable that participates in an association. In the association described above, x is a factor. It participates in the association with y.\nAn experiment has one or more factors. You can design an experiment to determine whether one or more variables are factors.\nFor example, you can design an experiment to determine whether x is a factor in the association between x and y.

The mean is the sum of the data divided by the number of data points.\nThe standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data around the mean. A low standard deviation means that the data are very similar to the mean, while a high standard deviation means that the data are very different from the mean.\nA normal distribution is a symmetric, bell-shaped curve that has a mean and a standard deviation.\nThe mean is the center of the normal distribution. In a normal distribution, about 68% of the data fall within one standard deviation of the mean. So, about 68% of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and about 95% of the data are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.\nBecause normal distributions are symmetrical, the 95.43% of data that are within 2 standard deviations of the mean are also within 1 standard deviation of the mean. This means that about 95.43% of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.\nSo, in a normal distribution, the probability of a value being within 1 standard deviation of the mean is about 0.9543, or 95.43%.\nSOLUTION: To determine the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, consider the following:\nThe mean number of miles driven per year is 75,000 miles.\nThe standard deviation of the number of miles driven per year is 12,000 miles.\nYou are given that the cab has been driven over 80,000 miles.\nSo, the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles is the probability that the number of miles driven per year is less than 100,000 miles.\nThis probability is found using the following formula:\nThe probability that the number of miles driven per year is less than 100,000 miles is 0.34."}

How can you determine whether a study is an experimental study or an observational study?\nExperimental studies are designed to prove cause-and-effect relationships. Researchers manipulate the independent variable (the part of the study that is different or changed) to observe the dependent variable (the part of the study that is measured).\nFor example, researchers interested in finding out if caffeine helps people stay awake designed an experimental study. They manipulated the caffeine intake of participants (the independent variable) and measured how long participants were able to stay awake (the dependent variable).\nExperimental studies can be conducted in a laboratory or in the real world.\nAn observational study is designed to examine associations between variables. Researchers observe both the independent variable and the dependent variable in order to find out if they are related.\nFor example, researchers interested in finding out if there is a relationship between smoking and lung cancer observed both smoking habits and lung cancer rates in a group of people.\nObservational studies can be designed to observe associations between variables in a group of people (a group study) or between two variables in a sample of the population (a sample study).\nSOLUTION: A census is a complete count of all the members of a population. A census can establish the relationship between two variables in a population. But it is not always possible to conduct a census.\nSOLUTION: Observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments.\nMany people think that observational studies are easier to design than experimental studies. But observational studies can be biased by confounding variables.\nA confounding variable is an variable that is different between the groups being compared, but that is also associated with the dependent variable.\nFor example, experimenting with only men may be confounded by the fact that men and women have different lifestyles.\nObservational studies can be designed to overcome bias. For example, researchers could use statistical methods to remove the effect of confounding variables.\nControlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies.\nLater studies may be controlled experiments. But controlled experiments are not necessarily later studies. They can be conducted simultaneously.\nFor example, a controlled experiment can be conducted at the same time as an observational study. Some groups would receive the experimental treatment, and other groups would not.\nA useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size.\nA larger sample size makes it less likely that an observational study will be biased by confounding variables."}

Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is called the treatment group.\nYou grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is called the control group.\nA sample size of five pea plants in each group would be acceptable. This is because there are five pea plants in the treatment group and five pea plants in the control group.\nSOLUTION: In the study on the effect of music on worker productivity, each time a different genre of music was played, production went up. This tells you that changing the music has a positive effect on productivity.\nSo, the control group effect is happening. The control group effect happens when the control group shows that a treatment has a positive effect. In this case, each change in music was followed by an increase in production."}

A simulation is called a discrete simulation because the method is based on counting numbers.\nFor example, a farmer wants to estimate the total number of eggs produced by 200 hens over the next year. She knows that each hen lays an egg every day, and that each hen lay eggs until the farmer takes them to the shop. The farmer can use a discrete simulation to estimate the number of eggs produced by the hens.\nThe video below shows how to perform a discrete simulation.\nIn a discrete simulation, you assume that each unit in the system is assigned a number. These numbers can be used to calculate how many units meet certain criteria.\nFor example, to estimate the total number of eggs produced by the hens, the farmer can use a number called the laying rate, which is the average number of eggs laid by a hen per day. The farmer can then use a rule called an accumulation rule to calculate the total number of eggs laid by all the hens.\nAccumulation rule: The laying rate is 2.5 eggs per day, and the farmer has 200 hens. So, the flock lays 2.5 eggs per day times 200 hens, or 500 eggs per day.\nAfter 365 days, the flock will have laid 500 eggs per day times 365 days, or 182,500 eggs."}

The density of a normal distribution is highest at the mean of the distribution and decreases as you move farther from the mean.\nThe mean of a normal distribution is represented by \u03bc, and the standard deviation is represented by \u03c3. These two values describe the entire normal distribution.\nThe density function of a normal distribution is:\nf(x) = (1 / \u03c3 \u03c3) \u00b7 e^(-(x-\u03bc)\u00b2 / 2\u03c3\u00b2)\nFor a normal distribution, the following are true:\nthe mean is equal to the value \u03bc,\nthe standard deviation is equal to the value \u03c3,\nthe density function is symmetric about the mean, and\nthe density function has a bell-shaped curve.\nYou can use the z-score (also called the standard score) to determine how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. The z-score is given by the formula:\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\nA data point with a z-score of 0 is equal to the mean.

For example, a correlation of 0.2 could indicate a weak relationship that is not necessarily causative.\nSOLUTION: To convert the heights from inches to centimeters, divide by 2.54. To convert the weights from pounds to kilograms, divide by 2.2. So, the new heights are 2.52 times as long as the old heights, and the new weights are 2.2 times as heavy as the old weights.\nThe correlation between the new heights and new weights is 0.65.\nHowever, the old heights and weights are not directly related."}
{"question": "The number of days it takes to build a new house has a variance of 386. A sample of 40 new homes shows an average building time of 83 days. With what confidence can we assert that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "15.4%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "17.8%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20.0%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "82.1%"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The width of a confidence interval depends on the standard deviation and the number of samples. The standard deviation is calculated from a sample, which means that it is based on a random sample of data. A wide range of values in the sample will result in a wide standard deviation, and a narrow range of values will result in a narrow standard deviation.\nThe standard deviation is also affected by the number of samples. The sample standard deviation will be larger for a small sample than for a large sample.\nSo, the width of a confidence interval will be larger for a small sample than for a large sample.\nA 95% confidence interval means that the interval is based on the results of 95% of the samples. A 99% confidence interval means that the interval is based on the results of 99% of the samples.\nSOLUTION: The problem tells you that the sample standard deviation is 386, and the sample mean is 83. In order to determine the confidence interval, you need to know the number of samples. The problem does not provide this information. You can use the sample standard deviation and the sample mean to calculate a confidence interval.\nTo do this, first calculate the standard error of the mean. The standard error of the mean is the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\nThen, calculate the confidence interval. A 95% confidence interval means that the interval is based on the results of 95% of the samples. So, you need to look up the value of t with a margin of error of 0.05.\nFor a sample size of 40, the standard error of the mean is 386 / \u221a40 \u2248 30.2.\nThe value of t with a margin of error of 0.05 is 2.012.\nSo, the confidence interval is 80 \u00b1 2.012 \u00d7 30.2 = 80 \u00b1 60.568.\nThis interval is between 80 and 90. So, you can assert with 17.8% confidence that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days."}
