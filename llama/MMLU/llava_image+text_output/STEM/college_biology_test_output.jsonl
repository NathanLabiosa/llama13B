The carrying capacity is the maximum population size that the environment can support.\nWhen the population reaches its carrying capacity, the rate of population growth decreases. At this point, the K value, or carrying capacity, can be calculated.\nBeyond the carrying capacity, the curve becomes flat. This means that the population remains stable.\nIn the long run, the population will not grow beyond the carrying capacity. However, the population will continue to have random fluctuations around the carrying capacity.\nSOLUTION: The most effective means of controlling the mosquito population is to reduce the carrying capacity of the environment to lower the K value.\nMaintaining the population at a point corresponding to the midpoint of its logistic curve does not take into account how the population is affecting the environment.\nOpting for zero population control once the K value of the curve has been reached is not necessary.\nIncreasing the mortality rate would not be the best choice. It would not take into account how the population is affecting the environment."}

There are several different types of succession.\nPrimary succession involves the colonization of a previously barren area, such as a volcanic island or a glacial meltwater lake. Since the area was previously barren, there are no plants, animals, or soil. Primary succession proceeds through stages called the soil development stage and the colonization stage.\nDuring the soil development stage, soil is formed from the breakdown of rocks and minerals. This process is called weathering.\nDuring the colonization stage, the first plants and animals colonize the area. These pioneer species are hardy species that can survive in a variety of environments. They break down the rocks and minerals, making the area more habitable for other species.\nDuring secondary succession, an area that was previously covered by vegetation is disturbed. The disturbance could be a fire, a windstorm, or a logging operation. Secondary succession proceeds through the soil development stage and the colonization stage.\nDuring the soil development stage, soil is formed from rocks and minerals.\nDuring the colonization stage, pioneer species begin to colonize the area. These species are the first to return to the area. They are followed by other species, including many plants and animals.\nThe term weathering is also used to describe the breakdown of rocks and minerals into soil. Soil development is a necessary step in the process of primary succession.\nStabilizing succession is a type of community change that does not involve a change in the type of soil or the breakdown of rocks and minerals. Stabilizing succession can follow secondary succession.\nIn stabilizing succession, the ecosystem becomes more stable. The population of plants and animals becomes more diverse.

The chromomere is a region of the chromosome that contains genes.\nWhen a cell divides, each daughter cell receives the chromosomes it needs to survive from the parent cell. This process is called cell division.\nThere are two main types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. During mitosis, a cell divides to form two identical daughter cells. During meiosis, a cell divides to form four nonidentical daughter cells.\nDuring mitosis, the mitotic spindle attaches to the kinetochore. The mitotic spindle is a structure that breaks down the chromosomes into pieces.\nThese pieces are called chromatids. Each chromatid is made up of a chromosome and a centromere. The centromere is a region of the chromosome that contains genes.\nWhen the cell divides, the chromatids are pulled to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle. One chromatid goes to each daughter cell."}

Chromosomes contain genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nHybrids are formed when two species or groups of populations within a species breed. Hybrid offspring can be sterile, which means that they cannot produce offspring. This is because the two parent species often have different numbers of chromosomes.\nChromosome numbers are counts of how many chromosomes a cell has. Offspring cells receive their chromosomes, and therefore their chromosome number, from their parents. In a hybrid, the offspring may receive unequal chromosome counts from the two parents. This is called an irregular chromosome number.\nAn organism with an irregular chromosome number may be sterile. This is because the offspring may have an odd number of chromosomes. An organism with an odd number of chromosomes is not able to back up its genes on a chromosome before meiosis. Meiosis is the process by which cells form sex cells. Sex cells fuse to form eggs and sperm. An organism's eggs and sperm are formed from sex cells. An organism with an irregular chromosome number cannot form eggs and sperm. So, the organism is sterile and cannot produce offspring.\nSOLUTION: The parent plant with the double chromosome number would have an irregular chromosome number.

Adaptations are features that help plants or animals survive or reproduce.\nOne type of adaptation is called transpiration. Transpiration is the process plants use to get water from their roots to their leaves. Water is vital to plants because it carries nutrients to different parts of the plant.\nHigh relative humidity and low relative humidity have different effects on transpiration. High relative humidity means that the air is already humid, or full of water. Low relative humidity means that the air is dry.\nWind can also increase transpiration. When wind blows over a plant, it causes the stoma to open more. Stoma are small openings on the underside of plant leaves.\nHigh temperature also increases transpiration. As temperature goes up, plants transpire more.\nSOLUTION: High relative humidity and low relative humidity affect transpiration, but in different ways. High relative humidity decreases transpiration, while low relative humidity increases transpiration.\nWind and high temperature both increase transpiration.

Enzymes can alter the free energy of a reaction, which affects the probability that the reaction will occur.\nThe free energy of a reaction is a measure of how much energy is available to do work. A reaction with a negative value for free energy is called a inverted reaction. Inverted reactions are often followed by other reactions in the cell.\nEnzymes can decrease the free energy of a inverted reaction by reducing the activation energy of the reaction. Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy that must be available to start the reaction. By binding to the reactants of the reaction, an enzyme can bring them closer together and convert the energy of binding into a lower activation energy.\nAs a result of the lower activation energy, more of the reaction occurs. The change in free energy of the reaction decreases as the value of the free energy of the reaction gets closer to zero.\nAt the maximal rate of reaction, the change in free energy of the reaction decreases to zero. This means that the enzyme is able to convert all of the reactants into products.\nThe activation energy of the reaction decreases to zero at the maximal rate of reaction. This means that the reaction is able to proceed without any barrier to activation.\nAt the maximal rate of reaction, nearly all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with the substrate molecules. These interactions enable the enzyme to convert all of the reactants into products."}

It can make chemical reactions happen faster. Enzymes can be inhibited by competitive inhibitors.\nA competitive inhibitor of an enzyme exerts its effect by binding to the enzyme. Because the inhibitor and substrate have the same binding site, they compete for access to this site. By binding to the enzyme, the inhibitor prevents the substrate from binding. So, the inhibitor is binding to the enzyme and the substrate is not.\nAn irreversible competitive inhibitor is a type of competitive inhibitor that permanently binds to the enzyme. This binding prevents the enzyme's dissociation from the inhibitor. Because the inhibitor is part of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, the enzyme cannot bind to its substrate.\nA reversible competitive inhibitor is a type of competitive inhibitor that does not permanently bind to the enzyme. This inhibitor can bind to the enzyme and prevent the enzyme from binding to its substrate. But the inhibitor can also be removed, which allows the enzyme to bind to its substrate.\nA non-competitive inhibitor does not bind to the enzyme. Instead, it binds to the substrate. This binding prevents the substrate from binding to the enzyme."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSOLUTION: The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is best explained by segregation of alleles. Segregation of alleles occurs when alleles for a gene separate during meiosis and are inherited by different offspring.\nDuring meiosis, homologous chromosides (chromosides that are inherited together) separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. This separation is called segregation.\nAfter segregation, each offspring will receive one allele for a gene. An offspring's phenotype for a trait will be the observable version of that trait, which depends on the offspring's combination of alleles.\nFor example, consider a pea plant with the genotype FF or ff for the flower color gene. During segregation, the F allele and the f allele separate. Each offspring will receive one allele.\nA offspring will receive the F allele. Its genotype is FF, and its phenotype is purple flowers.\nB offspring will receive the f allele. Its genotype is ff, and its phenotype is white flowers."}
