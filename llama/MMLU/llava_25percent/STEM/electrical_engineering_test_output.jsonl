This is because the potentiometer has a resistive element that reduces the current in the circuit, whereas a voltmeter has a low impedance that increases the current in the circuit. Therefore, the potentiometer method is better suited for measuring lower voltages, while the direct measurement method is better for higher voltages."}

We also know that a load counter emf of 200 V requires a firing angle control of 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to find the range of possible firing angle controls that satisfy both conditions.\n\nThe firing angle control is defined as the angle between the sine wave voltage and the load counter emf. For this circuit, we can express the firing angle control as:\n\n\u03b8 = atan(E/R)\n\nwhere atan is the arc tangent function.\n\nThe range of possible firing angle controls depends on the range of values for the sine wave voltage and the load counter emf.\n\nFor the sine wave voltage, we have:\n\n400 sin(314 t) = 200 V cos(314 t)\n\nSince the voltage is a sine wave, the cosine function only has values between -1 and 1, and the sine function has values between 0 and \u03c0. Therefore, the range of possible values for the sine wave voltage is from 0 to 200 V.\n\nFor the load counter emf, we know that it has a value of 200 V.\n\nCombining these ranges, the range of possible firing angle controls is from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0."}

Both of these factors are important for the proper functioning of an oscillator, as an oscillator with unstable amplitude or frequency can fail to produce a stable output signal.\n\nAmplitude instability can lead to a lack of consistency in the output signal, while frequency instability can cause the oscillator to produce an output signal that is out of phase with the input signal. Both of these issues can lead to errors and inaccuracies in the final output of the oscillator, which can have serious consequences in applications such as electronic devices, communication systems, and scientific instruments.\n\nTherefore, it is important to ensure that an oscillator has both amplitude and frequency stability to ensure accurate and reliable operation."}

The frequency of an LC oscillator can be adjusted by changing the values of the inductor and capacitor, which are the two key components of the circuit.\n\nThe frequency range of an LC oscillator depends on the values of the inductor and capacitor and the circuit design.

To get this value, we need to first calculate the value of one cycle surge current for a 60 Hz supply, which is (50/1.6) \\* 4242.64 = 2560.42 A. Then, we need to divide this value by 1.5 to get the value of one cycle surge current for a 50 Hz supply, which is 2560.42 / 1.5 = 1623.27 A. However, we need to round this value up to the nearest integer to get the final answer, which is 1624 A. This means that the SCR has a half cycle surge current rating of 3000 A for a 50 Hz supply. However, it is important to note that this value is for theoretical purposes only, and actual surge currents may be higher due to other factors such as the presence of a reactor in the circuit.

If the diameter of the conductor is halved and its length is doubled, the cross-sectional area of the conductor is also halved, which means that the resistance will be doubled. However, since the length of the conductor has doubled, the resistance will also be multiplied by the length factor, which is the reciprocal of the formula for resistance (1/R = \u03c1l/A, where \u03c1 is the resistivity of the material and l is the length of the conductor). In this case, the length factor is 2R/l = 2\u03a9, which means that the resistance will be multiplied by 2\u03a9, or 2R\u03a9. The answer is (B) 2R\u03a9."}

This is known as \"latching\" because the thyristor \"latches\" onto the current. The latching current is typically much lower than the holding current, which is the current required to hold the thyristor on.\nFor a thyristor, the latching current is typically 10-20 times the holding current. Therefore, if the holding current of a thyristor is 2 mA, the latching current would be 0.004 A or 40 m"}

The elements with the same atomic number have the same number of electrons in their outermost energy level, which determines their chemical properties.\n\nIn contrast, the column number on the periodic table (choice (A)) determines the number of energy levels in an atom, the atomic mass (choice (B)) determines the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, and the row number on the periodic table (choice (C)) determines the position of the element in the periodic table based on its atomic number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Atomic number."}
