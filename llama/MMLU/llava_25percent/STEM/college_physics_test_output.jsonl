If 100 photons are sent into the detector, and the detector has a quantum efficiency of 0.1, then on average, 10 photons will be detected. The rms deviation is a measure of the spread of the distribution of the number of photons detected. With a quantum efficiency of 0.1, we would expect the rms deviation to be about 0.1.\n\nNote that this is just a simplification of the actual physics and the quantum efficiency and number of photons detected will depend on the specific properties of the detector and the photon source."}

In the case of the helium atom, this principle can be used to explain why the ortho- state has lower energy than the para- state. The difference in energy between the two states is due to the fact that the electrons in the para-state are more tightly bound, which leads to a higher energy level. This difference in energy can be traced back to the uncertainty principle, which states that the more precisely the position of an electron in the para-state is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. This leads to an increase in the total energy of the system. However, in the ortho-state, the electrons are in a more loosely bound state, which results in lower energy levels."}

If we know the temperature and the speed of sound, we can use the equations for the speed of sound and the speed of longitudinal waves (such as sound waves) in a solid to determine the frequency of resonance.\n\nAt 20\u00b0C, the speed of sound is 343.5 m/s (according to the equation v = \u221a(\u03b3 \\* R / M), where v is the speed of sound, \u03b3 is the acceleration due to gravity, R is the radius of the pipe, and M is the mass of the pipe). The pipe resonates at a frequency of 440 Hz.\n\nOn a particularly cold day, the temperature has dropped to a lower value, and the speed of sound in the pipe has decreased. We can calculate the new speed of sound using the equation v\\_new = v\\_old \\* (1 - \u03b3 \\* T / 273.15), where v\\_old is the speed of sound at the previous temperature, and \u03b3 is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe new temperature is 19\u00b0C, which is lower than 20\u00b0C. Therefore, the new speed of sound is:\nv\\_new = v\\_old \\* (1 - \u03b3 \\* 19 / 273.15)\n= 343.5 m/s \\* (1 - 0.504)\n= 343.5 m/s \\* 0.496\n= 163.62 m/s\n\nNow we can use the equation for the speed of sound in a solid to determine the frequency of resonance:\nf = v\\_new / 2\n= 163.62 m/s / 2\n= 81.815 Hz\n\nSince the pipe resonates at 440 Hz, we can see that the frequency of resonance has decreased to 81.815 Hz relative to the initial temperature of 20\u00b0C. So, the correct answer is (D) 440 Hz."}

The energy required to melt ice depends on its temperature, and as the temperature increases, the energy required to melt the ice also increases. This is because the melting point of ice increases with temperature, and more energy is needed to overcome this increase and melt the ice. As the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the energy available to melt the ice also increases by a factor of two. This means that the amount of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time will also increase by a factor of two. However, the amount of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is not directly related to the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the energy radiated per second per unit area by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Therefore, if the absolute temperature of the blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, the energy radiated per second per unit area will decrease by a factor of 81.\n\nHere's how to arrive at the answer:\nThe energy radiated per second per unit area by a blackbody is given by: E = \u03c3T^4, where E is the energy, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.\nIf the absolute temperature is increased by a factor of 3, we can write: T' = 3T.\nNow, using the definition of T' and the original equation for E, we have: E' = \u03c3(T')^4 = \u03c3(3T)^4 = \u03c3T^4(3/3)^4 = \u03c3T^4(1/3)^4 = \u03c3T^4(1/3)^4(3)^4 = \u03c3T^4(1/3)^12 = \u03c3T^4/3^12 = ("}

Therefore, the heat generated by friction is proportional to 1,000 kg times 100 meters, which is equal to 100,000 J.\n\nHowever, the elevator stops before it reaches the bottom of the shaft, so only the portion of the descent that takes place below the level of the emergency brakes is relevant for calculating the heat dissipated.

The work done by friction is given by the product of the force of friction and the distance traveled by the brakes. The distance traveled by the brakes is equal to the length of the shaft minus the length of the elevator below the emergency brakes, which is 100 meters.
