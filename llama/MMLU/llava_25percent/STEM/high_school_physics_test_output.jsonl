Since the force from the surface (FS) is equal to the force from the normal force (FN), we can write:\n\nFS = FN = mg + mu FSN\n\nSolving for FSN, we get:\n\nFSN = (mg - FN) / mu\n\nSince FN = mg, we have:\n\nFSN = (mg - mg) / mu = 0 / mu\n\nThis means that the frictional force is equal to zero, and the box slides indefinitely until it comes to rest.

This statement correctly describes the possible outcome of the reaction because the conservation of energy requires that the total energy of the system must be conserved before and after the interaction.

The force of friction between the object and the plane also acts in the opposite direction to the weight, providing stability and preventing the object from sliding.\n\nIf the angle of the plane increases, the normal force acts vertically upward and the force of friction acts in the opposite direction to the weight and the normal force. As the angle of the plane increases, the force of friction will decrease, because the surface area of contact between the object and the plane decreases, and the force of friction is proportional to the surface area of contact. However, the normal force will not decrease linearly, because it is determined by the force of gravity and the angle of the plane, and it may not decrease as the angle increases at a constant rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) decreases nonlinearly, as the normal force and the force of friction will both decrease as the angle increases, but the decrease in the force of friction may not be proportional to the increase in the angle."}

This is because when the source approaches the detector, the relative motion between them causes a Doppler shift, which results in a change in the frequency of the perceived sound. If both the source and detector are stationary with respect to each other, then no Doppler shift would be perceived. However, if the detector is stationary and the source moves towards the detector, or if the source and detector both move towards each other, a Doppler shift would be perceived. Similarly, if the detector is stationary and the source moves away from it, or if the source and detector both move away from each other, a redshift would be perceived. The situation in (C) is also a redshift, not a Doppler shift, because the relative motion between the two objects is in the same direction."}

The gravitational mass of an object is directly measured using the slope of the graph of net force on the vertical axis and acceleration on the horizontal axis. The gravitational mass is the measure of the mass of an object that determines its response to the force of gravity. The weight of an object is a measure of the force of gravity acting on the object, and it is related to the gravitational mass by the equation weight = gravitational mass x acceleration due to gravity. The mass of an object can also be measured directly using spring scales or other methods, but these measurements are not directly related to the slope of the graph. Velocity is a measure of the speed and direction of motion of an object, and it is related to the acceleration of the object by the equation velocity = distance/time.

If the block's area remains the same, a longer block with the same coefficient of friction will experience a greater frictional force than a shorter block. The height of the block doesn't affect the frictional force directly, but it does affect the block's area, which is proportional to the square of its length.\n\nSo, if we have two blocks of the same material with half the height and twice the length, their areas will be:\n\nArea1 = (1/2)A\nArea2 = 2A\n\nThe frictional force is proportional to the product of the coefficient of friction, the block's area, and the force applied to the block. For the longer block, the force applied to it is twice the force applied to the shorter block, since the frictional force is proportional to the force. Therefore, the frictional force for the longer block is:\n\n(1/2)f \u00d7 (2A) \u00d7 2 = 4f\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) 4f."}

The acceleration of an object in free fall is proportional to its mass and the gravitational acceleration, which means that the acceleration decreases as the object falls. Therefore, if the object experiences drag force proportional to its speed, it will experience a deceleration force that opposes the gravitational force and causes its speed to decrease over time.

If the dependent variable (volume) is on the vertical axis, the slope of the line will be the pressure of the gas. This is because an increase in temperature will cause the gas to expand, which in turn will lead to an increase in volume if the pressure is held constant. The slope of the line will be proportional to the pressure of the gas.\n\nThe intercept of the line will be 0 m^3, which is because at 0 K (-273.15\u00b0C), the pressure of an ideal gas is 0 atm, and the volume is also 0 m^3, as there is no space for the gas to occupy. Therefore, the temperature at which the volume is 0 m^3 is 0 K.\n\nIn summary, the slope of the plot will be linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m^3."}

As the car starts to move up the incline, its acceleration will be non-zero due to the force of gravity acting on it. The force of gravity acting on an object on an inclined plane is given by the equation:\n\nFg = m \\* g \\* sin(\u03b8)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the car is moving up the incline, its acceleration will be in the opposite direction to the force of gravity, and its magnitude will be given by:\n\nax = Fg \\* sin(\u03b8) / m\n\nSince the car is not using its engine, it is not exerting any force on the road, and its acceleration will be solely due to the force of gravity. Therefore, the magnitude of the car's acceleration will be:\n\nax = Fg \\* sin(\u03b8) / m = g \\* sin(\u03b8)\n\nSince the angle of the incline is positive (i.e., the car is moving upwards), the vertical component of the car's acceleration will be negative (i.e., in the opposite direction to the force of gravity), and its magnitude will be:\n\nay = -g \\* sin(\u03b8)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) ax = 0; ay < g."}

Therefore, the final volume of the gas is equal to the initial volume minus the volume of the cylinder. The mass of the gas is also constant, so the pressure is inversely proportional to the mass of the gas. Since the mass of the gas decreases by half during the process, the pressure increases by a factor of 2. The temperature remains constant, so the gas behaves as an ideal gas.

We are given the input power, which is 120V x 1.0A = 120W, and the efficiency is 75%, so the output power is 75% of the input power, or 0.75 x 120W = 90W.\nWe also need to know the torque of the motor, which is given by the formula: T = I x \u03c9, where T is torque, I is current, and \u03c9 is speed. The input torque is 1.0Nm, and the efficiency is 75%, so the output torque is 0.75 x 1.0Nm = 0.75Nm.\nWe can now use Newton's second law of motion, F = ma, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.

The radius of the planet is also twice that of Earth, so the distance between the astronaut and the center of the planet is also twice as large.\n\nLet's use m1 to represent the mass of the Earth and r1 to represent the radius of the Earth. The mass of the planet is then m2 = 2 \\* m1, and the radius of the planet is r2 = 2 \\* r1.\n\nTo find the gravitational force between the astronaut and the planet, we can multiply the gravitational constant (G) by the product of the masses and the radius squared: F = G \\* m1 \\* m2 / (r1^2 \\* r2^2).\n\nSince the mass of the astronaut is equal to his weight on Earth, we can set m1 = 800 N and solve for the mass of the planet: m2 = 800 N / F.\n\nWe also know that the gravitational force between two objects is equal to the product of their masses and the gravitational constant, divided by the square of the distance between them.

This is because the increased mass will cause the pendulum to take more time to swing back and forth, resulting in a longer period.\n\nOption (B) Decreasing the length of the string will not have a significant effect on the period of the pendulum, as the length of the string is already at a minimum when it is released.\n\nOption (C) Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released will also not have a significant effect on the period of the pendulum, as the angle of release only affects the initial acceleration of the pendulum, and the subsequent motion is primarily determined by its length and mass.\n\nOption (D) Decreasing the mass of the ball will also not have a significant effect on the period of the pendulum, as the period is determined primarily by the mass of the ball and the length of the pendulum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Increasing the mass of the ball."}

The centripetal force is the force that keeps an object moving in a circular path, and it is equal to the vehicle's mass multiplied by the square of its velocity divided by the radius of the curve. In this case, the friction force acts in a direction that opposes the vehicle's motion, while the normal force acts perpendicular to the surface of the road and provides support to the vehicle. The weight of the car provides an upward force that is also necessary to balance the force of gravity acting on the vehicle. Therefore, a combination of the normal force and the friction force is required to provide the necessary centripetal force for the car to maintain its circular motion around the curve."}

We can use the formula for the total velocity of an object moving in a horizontal direction:\n\ntotal velocity = initial velocity + (final velocity / time)\n\nWe know the initial velocity (30 m/s) and the time (4 seconds), so we need to find the final velocity. We can use the formula for the final velocity of an object falling under gravity:\n\nfinal velocity = initial velocity + acceleration\\*(time)\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2, so we can substitute that into the formula:\n\nfinal velocity = 30 m/s + 9.8 m/s^2 \\* 4 s\n\nFinal velocity = 30 m/s + 39.2 m/s\n\nFinal velocity = 69.2 m/s\n\nNow that we have the final velocity, we can plug it into the total velocity formula:\n\ntotal velocity = final velocity + (final velocity / time)\n\ntotal velocity = 69.2 m/s + (69.2 m/s / 4 s)\n\ntotal velocity = 69.2 m/s + 17.3 m/s\n\ntotal velocity = 86.5 m/s\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n(B) 40 m/s"}
