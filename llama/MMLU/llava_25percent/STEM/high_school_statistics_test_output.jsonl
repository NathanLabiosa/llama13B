However, a high response rate alone does not guarantee that the survey is well-designed, as other factors such as selection bias and proper use of chance can also impact the quality of the survey.\n\n(C) Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\n\nExplanation: Selection bias occurs when the sample is selected in a way that causes certain groups to be overrepresented or underrepresented, and this can lead to biased results. The fact that only two of the adults do not agree to participate in the survey raises concerns about selection bias, as it is possible that those who agreed to participate are different from those who declined in some way that affects their confidence in the U.S. economy.\n\n(D) A voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions.\n\nExplanation: A voluntary response study is one in which participants are asked to participate voluntarily, rather than being selected randomly. This can lead to selection bias, as those who volunteer may be different from those who do not volunteer in some way that affects their confidence in the U.S. economy.

In this case, the company wants to test a new cholesterol-reducing drug against the previous drug, and it anticipates an association between cholesterol level and the amount of exercise a person gets. Therefore, it makes sense to block on exercise level because it is associated with cholesterol level. Blocking on gender or males and females being different is not appropriate because the company does not anticipate much association between cholesterol level and gender. Blocking on the type of drug is not appropriate because the company does not anticipate much association between the new drug and cholesterol level."}

By blocking on sleep length, the experiment can control for this variable and determine whether the effect of fish oil or garlic capsules on cholesterol levels is affected by sleep length. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect because blocking on exercise intensity and cholesterol level, respectively, would not control for sleep length and would not be able to determine whether sleep length affects the effect of fish oil or garlic capsules on cholesterol levels. Choice (D) is incorrect because blocking on capsule type would not control for sleep length and would not be able to determine whether sleep length affects the effect of fish oil or garlic capsules on cholesterol levels."}

The specificity of the test is the proportion of dogs without heartworm that test negative, which is also 98%. We can use these values to calculate the positive and negative predictive values of the test:\n\nPositive predictive value (PPV) = sensitivity x specificity = 96% x 98% = 93.24%\nNegative predictive value (NPV) = 1 - specificity = 98%\n\nThe PPV tells us the proportion of positive test results that are actually true positives, which is 93.24%. The NPV tells us the proportion of negative test results that are actually true negatives, which is 98%.\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected dog that tested positive actually has heartworm, we need to use Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) x P(A)) / P(B)\n\nwhere P(A|B) is the probability that a randomly selected dog that tests positive actually has heartworm, given that it tests positive. P(B|A) is the proportion of dogs with heartworm that test positive, which is 96%. P(A) is the proportion of dogs with heartworm, which is 10%.

In this case, Mr. Bee's class has a standard deviation of 11.2, while Mr. Em's class has a standard deviation of 5.6.

Since miles per year is normally distributed, we can use the normal distribution table or calculate the probabilities using the formula for the probability of an exclusive event.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it is the probability of the complementary event, which is the probability that the randomly selected cab has been driven more than 100,000 miles.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it is the probability that the randomly selected cab has been driven between 80,000 and 100,000 miles, which includes the event of being driven less than 100,000 miles.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because it is the probability of the complementary event, which is the probability that the randomly selected cab has been driven more than 100,000 miles.\n\nOption (C) is correct because it is the probability of the given event, which is the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles."}

We can use the Z-score formula to find these values.\n\nThe Z-score of a value is given by:\nZ = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\nwhere x is the value we want to find the Z-score for, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nTo find the minimum value, we need to find the negative Z-score that corresponds to the 2.5% percentile, which is given by -2.5 * \u03c3 / \u221a(2\u03c0). This gives us -3.28. Therefore, the minimum value is:\nx = 3,250 - 3.28 = 3,216.12\n\nTo find the maximum value, we need to find the positive Z-score that corresponds to the 97.5% percentile, which is given by 2.57 * \u03c3 / \u221a(2\u03c0).

In this case, we have four patients, and taking the medicine produces a side effect in one in five patients, which means that the probability of success (none of the patients developing side effects) is 0.95 (1 - 0.15^4). So the probability we want is 0.95^4, which is approximately 0.2788.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this by observing that the probability of exactly zero side effects is the same as the probability of exactly one side effect, which occurs if at least one patient takes the medicine and at least one patient does not. The probability of at least one patient not developing side effects is therefore (1 - 0.15)^4 = 0.8412, or about 84.12%. This is greater than 0.95^4, so the probability of none of the patients developing side effects is less than or equal to (0.8412)^4 = 0.2783.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 0.2, or 20%."}

The P-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed value (0.35) under the null hypothesis of p=0.3. The smaller the P-value, the more evidence against the null hypothesis and the stronger the support for the alternative hypothesis.

Therefore, the probability of both events occurring (i.e., P(A and B)) is equal to the product of their individual probabilities, which is given by P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B). In other words, P(A and B) is the joint probability of A and B, and it is equal to the product of their marginal probabilities, which are P(A) and P(B). Similarly, the probability of either event occurring given the other event is also equal to the probability of the other event given the first event, which is P(B|A) = P(A|B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B). Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."}

Here is why:\n\n(A) An experiment involves manipulating an independent variable and measuring its effect on a dependent variable. The teacher's technique of giving a practice quiz every week could be considered an independent variable manipulation, but without additional information about the control group or randomization, it is not possible to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the practice quiz and the students' grades.\n\n(B) An experiment can be used to establish a cause-and-effect relationship, but without additional information, it is not possible to determine whether the teacher's technique is a well-designed experiment or not. It is possible that other factors influenced the students' grades, such as their prior knowledge, motivation, or study habits.\n\n(C) An observational study involves observing and reporting on patterns or relationships between variables without manipulating them. However, without a control group, it is not possible to determine whether the observed differences between the students who received the practice quizzes and those who did not are due to the quizzes themselves or other factors.\n\n(D) An observational study requires random assignment of subjects to different groups, but without a control group, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of the teacher's technique.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) An experiment, but with no reasonable conclusion possible about cause and effect."}

The higher the P-value, the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis, and the more confident we can be in rejecting it. On the other hand, if the P-value is very small, it indicates that the evidence against the null hypothesis is strong, and we can reject it with a high degree of confidence.
