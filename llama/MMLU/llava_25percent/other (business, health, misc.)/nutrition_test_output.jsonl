This is because people who survive the disease will have a higher probability of getting infected again in the future. On the other hand, if the incidence rate of the disease falls, it means that fewer people are getting infected with the disease, which will result in a decrease in the prevalence of the disease over time. If the recovery of the disease is faster, it means that people who get infected with the disease will recover more quickly, but it will not necessarily increase the prevalence of the disease in the population. And if the population in which the disease is measured increases, there will be more people in the population for the disease to affect, but it will not necessarily increase the prevalence of the disease."}

It is known chemically as C2H5OH. The energy content of a substance can be measured in kilocalories per gram (kcal/g), which is a unit of energy. In order to find out how many kilocalories are in one gram of ethanol, we need to convert the energy content of ethanol from kilojoules per gram (kJ/g) to kilocalories per gram (kcal/g).\n\n1 kJ is equivalent to 0.238 kcal, so to convert the energy content from kJ/g to kcal/g, we need to multiply the kJ/g value by 0.238. Therefore, 23.5 kJ/g = 23.5 x 0.238 = 5.38 kcal/g.\n\nSimilarly, 19.7 kJ/g = 19.7 x 0.238 = 4.53 kcal/g, and 29.7 kJ/g = 29.7 x 0.238 = 7.18 kcal/g.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is (B) 19.7 kJ or 4.1 kcal per g, because this value is the closest to the actual energy content of ethanol, which is approximately 23.5 kJ per gram."}

It is affected by factors such as age, gender, weight, height, and body composition. While BMR can be affected by certain medical conditions such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, it is not measured in a comfortable sitting position. In fact, measuring BMR requires specialized equipment and testing procedures. Additionally, BMR is not unaltered in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as these conditions can affect metabolism and other factors that contribute to BMR. Finally, weight loss or gain can affect BMR, but it is not unaltered after weight loss.\n```"}

As more people move to cities, they depend on purchasing food, rather than growing it themselves. This increases their vulnerability to food price increases, which can lead to food insecurity and malnutrition. Additionally, urban areas often have limited space and resources for food production, making it difficult to grow enough food to meet the city's needs. This can lead to a reliance on imported or commercially produced food, which can be more expensive and less nutritious than locally produced food. Finally, urban areas often have better access to healthcare and education, which can help to reduce hunger and malnutrition."}

This is because high-protein diets are more filling and help to preserve lean body mass, while low GI diets provide consistent energy release and help to prevent spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels.\nWhen it comes to weight maintenance, it is important to consume enough protein to support muscle maintenance and prevent muscle loss, while also keeping track of calorie intake to prevent weight gain. A high-protein, low GI diet can help to support weight maintenance by promoting satiety, reducing calorie intake, and minimizing spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels.\nIn contrast, a low protein and high GI diet may not be appropriate for weight maintenance because it may not provide enough protein to support muscle maintenance and could lead to weight gain due to its tendency to promote weight gain and spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels. Similarly, a high protein and low GI diet may not be appropriate for weight maintenance because it may be too high in calories and protein, which could also lead to weight gain.\nTherefore, the recommended diet for weight maintenance is a high protein and low GI diet."}

These pathways occur in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of cells, respectively.\n\nAnaerobic glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of red blood cells, which do not contain mitochondria, and is the only pathway they can use to metabolize glucose. Aerobic glycolysis and the Krebs cycle require oxygen and are only possible in cells that have mitochondria, such as most other types of cells.\nFructose cannot be used for gluconeogenesis in the liver, but it can be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis can occur in both the liver and kidneys, and it is the process by which glucose is produced from other substrates such as lactate, glycerol, or amino acids.\nRed blood cells do not have the ability to catalyze aerobic glycolysis or the Krebs cycle because they lack mitochondria. Instead, they rely on anaerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway to metabolize glucose.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is (D) Red blood cells can only metabolise glucose by anaerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway."}

The amount and composition of dietary fat are important factors for influencing blood lipid metabolism.\n\n(A) is correct. Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations. Saturated fatty acids can increase plasma triglyceride concentrations, while n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids can decrease them. Monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, have no clear effect on plasma triglyceride concentrations. Soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols can also lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels, but they do not affect plasma triglyceride concentrations.

This is because milk is a good source of calcium and other nutrients that are important for bone health. While there may be other factors that influence fracture risk, the evidence suggests that milk consumption can have a positive impact on bone health. (A) has been reported to be associated with a higher incidence of fracture and higher mortality in a few studies, but this evidence is not consistent. (B) During puberty seems to be associated with higher bone mineral density in later life, but this is not directly related to fracture risk. (D) In countries with the highest rate of fracture suggests that milk consumption is beneficial to the skeleton, but this is a correlation, not a causation."}

Transnational private-sector firms are one source of agricultural research, but they primarily focus on profits and may not prioritize research that benefits poor farmers and consumers. Public investment and research organizations, such as government agencies and non-governmental organizations, can also support pro-poor research that addresses the specific needs of poor farmers and consumers.\n\nB) Agricultural research mainly benefits commercial farmers in developed countries.\n\nExplanation: Agricultural research can benefit both commercial and smallholder farmers in developed and developing countries, but it is often designed to meet the needs of commercial farmers who have more resources and access to markets. Pro-poor research focuses on addressing the specific needs and challenges of poor farmers and consumers, such as improving nutrition, increasing resilience to climate change, and reducing poverty.\n\nC) Research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a 'public good' with little profit potential but high social benefits; public investment is needed to support it.\n\nExplanation: Pro-poor research is a public good that has high social benefits but little profit potential. It focuses on addressing the needs and challenges of poor farmers and consumers, such as improving nutrition, increasing resilience to climate change, and reducing poverty. Public investment is needed to support pro-poor research, which can be costly and may not generate profits.\n\nD) Pro-poor research should only focus on organic farming.\n\nExplanation: While organic farming can be an important part of pro-po"}
