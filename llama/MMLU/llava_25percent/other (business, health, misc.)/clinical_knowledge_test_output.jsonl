It phosphorylates creatine to form phosphocreatine, which is then used to replenish ATP stores in the muscle. When muscles are subjected to intense exercise, CK activity increases as a result of the increased demand for ATP. This increase in CK activity is indicative of muscle damage and can be used as a measure of muscle performance.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because intracellular ADP levels do not directly regulate CK activity. Option (B) is incorrect because muscle pH is not a direct regulator of CK activity. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no clear difference in CK activity between Type I and Type II muscle fibres. Option (D) is correct because CK activity increases after a period of endurance training, which is a type of intense exercise that places a high demand on ATP resources in the muscle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D)."}

It consists of four components: early defibrillation, early CPR, recognition and call for help early, and post-resuscitation care. The order of these components is important, as each one builds on the previous one and increases the chance of survival.\nEarly defibrillation is the first link in the chain of survival, as it is critical to restoring normal rhythm and preventing brain damage that can occur from cardiac arrest. Early CPR is the second link, as it improves blood circulation and oxygenation to the brain and other vital organs, which can also help to prevent brain damage. Recognition and call for help early is the third link, as it can help to start the chain of survival early and increase the likelihood of survival. Finally, post-resuscitation care is the fourth link, as it is important for the patient's long-term recovery and rehabilitation.\nTherefore, the correct order for the chain of survival is: 1.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n1 hour = 60 min = 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds\n\nThe patient will receive 40 mg/min x 3600 s/hr = 144,000 mg/hr = 144,000 / 0.001 = 144,000,000 mg/min\n\nFinally, we need to convert this to milligrams/kilogram/minute (mg/kg/min). There are 1000 grams in a kilogram, so:\n144,000,000 mg/min = 144,000,000 / 1000 = 144,000 mg/kg/min\n\nSo, for a 65 kg person, the dose in an hour is:\n144,000 mg/kg/min x 0.65 kg = 94,400 mg/min\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 156,000 mg/min."}
