However, relying too heavily on heuristics can lead to biases and errors in decision making, such as the \"rule of thumb\" bias, also known as availability heuristic. This bias involves estimating the frequency or probability of an event based on how easily examples come to mind, rather than on a more accurate assessment of the underlying frequency or probability of the event."}

They possess certain characteristics such as vision, courage, and the ability to inspire others. Margaret Thatcher, as a political leader, was known for her conservative political ideology and her unyielding leadership style, which led to significant changes in the UK's economy and society, including privatizing state-owned industries, reducing the power of trade unions, and increasing the role of the market in the economy. However, her leadership style was often seen as divisive and authoritarian, which did not inspire the same level of loyalty and support from her followers as transformational leaders do."}

This type of work group is often characterized by a high degree of specialization and a clear hierarchy, with line managers who oversee the work of the team and provide guidance and direction. \nOption (A) \"Dependent\" is not appropriate as the workers have clearly defined tasks, and they are not dependent on one another. Option (B) \"Independent\" is also not appropriate as the workers have demarcated tasks and work together as a team, but not in a completely independent manner. Option (D) \"Collaborative\" is not appropriate either, as the workers have separate tasks and responsibilities, and their work is not necessarily collaborative. \nOption (C) \"Interdependent\" is the most appropriate choice as the workers in this work group rely on one another to complete their tasks, but their work is also clearly defined and separate.

The functional structure allows employees to specialise in specific areas of expertise, such as marketing, finance, or human resources, and to work independently to achieve specific goals.\n\nMatrix, divisional, and multi-divisional structures may also involve specialisation, but to a lesser extent than functional structures. In a matrix structure, employees may be organised based on both function and product or project, which can encourage cross-functional collaboration and specialisation. In a divisional structure, employees are organised based on products or production processes, which can also encourage specialisation within each division. In a multi-divisional structure, employees are organised based on both function and division, which can also encourage specialisation within each division.\n\nHowever, functional structures are most focused on specialisation, as employees are organised based on their job function rather than any other factor.

This type of decision is typically made by a computer program or an algorithm, and it is not based on human judgment or discretion. The characteristics of a programmed decision are that it is complex and risky.\n\n(A) Complex and risky: Programmed decisions are complex because they involve a set of rules and procedures that must be followed in order to make the decision. They are also risky because they rely on the accuracy and effectiveness of the rules or procedures to produce the desired outcome. If the rules or procedures are not appropriate for the situation, the decision may be incorrect or ineffective.\n(B) Uncertain and non-routine: Programmed decisions are not typically made in uncertain or non-routine situations. They are based on predefined rules or procedures that are designed to work in specific situations.\n(C) Low risk and certain: Programmed decisions are not typically low risk and certain. They may be risky because of the possibility of errors or inefficiencies in the rules or procedures.\n(D) Routine and non-complex: Programmed decisions are not typically routine and non-complex.
