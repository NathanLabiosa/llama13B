The tax is based on an employer's experience rating, which is determined by their history of claiming unemployment benefits. The tax revenue collected through FUTA is used to pay unemployment benefits to workers who have lost their jobs and are unable to find new employment. The purpose of the FUTA is to provide financial assistance to workers who are permanently out of work and need support in supporting themselves. Option A is incorrect because the eligibility for unemployment benefits is determined by the state unemployment insurance agency, not the federal government. Option B is correct because the federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes.

Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, gain from the sale of property held for more than one year is eligible for preferential capital gains tax rates. To qualify for the 10-year recovery period, the property must be held for more than one year, and the sale must occur within 10 years of the contribution. Since Acre held the property for more than one year, it qualifies for the 10-year recovery period. However, since the sale occurred on the first day of the partnership's existence, Acre cannot claim accelerated depreciation under Section 179, which allows a taxpayer to deduct a significant portion of the cost of certain property in the year it is placed in service. Also, since the sale occurred within the 10-year recovery period, Acre will not be entitled to any additional Section 179 benefits.

Make inquiries of management concerning restrictions on the availability of cash balances.\n\nA CPA usually performs inquiries of management concerning restrictions on the availability of cash balances when reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer. This is because nonissuer entities do not issue securities, and their financial statements are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as those of public companies. Therefore, the CPA's focus is on the financial statements and the entity's internal controls, rather than on the entity's securities or the market for those securities."}

The cost of the insurance coverage can be calculated by multiplying Johnson's salary ($100,000) by the annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance ($2.76 per $1,000), which gives us $276. Then we add that amount to Johnson's salary to get $100,276. However, this is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) $100,552. This amount includes Johnson's salary of $100,000 and the cost of the group term life insurance coverage of $552, which is calculated by multiplying Johnson's salary by the annual cost of insurance, and then adding that amount to Johnson's salary. This is the amount that Johnson must include in gross income.\n\nAnother way to find the correct answer is to use the formula: Gross Income = Salary + Bonus. In this case, the bonus is the cost of the group term life insurance coverage, which is twice Johnson's salary. Therefore, Johnson's gross income is $100,000 + $100,000 \\* $2 = $100,000 + $200,000 = $300,000. This is also the amount that Johnson must include in gross income."}

In order to avoid a tax return preparer penalty, the tax return preparer must have a reasonable basis for the position taken on the tax return. This means that the position taken must be based on a reasonable interpretation of the tax laws and regulations, and there must be some evidence to support the position.\n\nIn the situation described, if the CPA had a reasonable basis for the position taken on the tax return, such as substantial authority or a reasonable possibility of success, then the tax return preparer penalty would not be applicable. However, if the position taken was unreasonable, or there was no reasonable basis for the position, the penalty could be applicable.\n\nIt is important to note that tax return preparers have a duty to comply with the standards of the tax profession and to prepare returns in a competent and diligent manner. If a tax return preparer knowingly or recklessly prepares a false or fraudulent return, they could be subject to penalties and sanctions, including criminal prosecution."}

The statement of cash flows reflects the cash receipts and payments of a company during a specific period, such as a year. In this scenario, Ace Co. issued 1000 shares of its $10 par value common stock for $15 per share in cash, resulting in a cash inflow of $15000.

In this case, the company issued 40,000 additional shares of common stock during the year, so the EPS would need to be adjusted for this.\n\nTo calculate the EPS, we start with the net income of $480,000 and divide it by the number of outstanding shares of common stock at the end of the year, which is 120,000 plus 10,000, or 130,000. This gives us an EPS of $3.50.\n\nHowever, we also need to adjust for the additional 40,000 shares of common stock issued during the year. We can do this by adding the net income attributable to the additional shares to the net income and dividing by the total number of outstanding shares at the end of the year. This gives us an EPS of $3.50 + $480,000 / (130,000 + 40,000) = $3.50 + $1.32 = $4.82.\n\nTherefore, the EPS for the year would be $4.82, which is closest to option A."}

The purpose of fitting the errors to obtain a more precise estimate of the stock's beta is to estimate the dependent variable, the error term, and the independent variable, the stock's beta coefficient. The dependent variable is the stock's returns, and the independent variable is the market returns. Fitting the errors involves using a linear regression technique to estimate the relationship between the stock's returns and the market returns. The beta coefficient is a measure of the stock's sensitivity to changes in the market returns, and it is a measure of the stock's volatility and its dependence on market conditions. The alpha is a measure of the stock's idiosyncratic volatility, which is the stock's volatility that is unrelated to market conditions."}

The NPV ranking does not change if the market rate changes, as long as the discount rate used to calculate the NPV remains constant. This is because the NPV is a relative measure of the project's financial attractiveness, and changes in the market rate only affect the discount factor used to calculate the NPV, but not the NPV itself.\nThe IRR (Internal Rate of Return) is another financial measure that compares the rate of return on a project to the risk-free rate of return. The IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV of a project becomes zero, and it is used to determine the profitability of a project. The IRR ranking of projects may change if the market rate changes, as it depends on the project's cash flows and the discount rate used to calculate the IRR.\nThe correct statement is (A) The ranking of projects by NPV is invariant to changes in the market rate. It is important to note that both NPV and IRR are important metrics for project evaluation, but their ranking of projects may change depending on the discount rate used for NPV and the IRR calculation."}

Since the policy began in January of the current year, there is no unamortized cost. The accounting for insurance expense has changed from the cash basis to the accrual basis in the current year. Therefore, the insurance expense for the current year should be recognized in the income statement as follows:\n$240,000 - 4 years = $60,000 per year\n$60,000 x 2 = $120,000 for the current year\n\nBut, since the policy was paid in advance, the $120,000 insurance expense should be recognized over the policy period. Therefore, there is no need to record a debit to prepaid insurance. Instead, there should be a $60,000 debit to insurance expense and a $120,000 debit to prepaid asset. At the end of the year, the prepaid asset should be amortized, and the $18,000 amortization should be credited to retained earnings. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."}
