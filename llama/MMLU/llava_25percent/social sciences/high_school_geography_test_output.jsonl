The theory was used to justify US involvement in the Vietnam War, as the US believed that if Vietnam fell to communism, it would set off a chain reaction that would eventually lead to the fall of all of Southeast Asia. However, the theory ultimately proved to be incorrect, as the dominoes did not fall as expected.\n\nThe domino theory is an example of a geopolitical theory, which is a theory that attempts to explain the behavior of states and other actors in the international system. Geopolitical theories often attempt to predict or explain the patterns of international relations and the behavior of nations in relation to each other. However, as the domino theory demonstrates, these theories are not always accurate, and they can lead to misguided policies and decisions.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the domino theory is an example of a geopolitical theory that sought to explain the behavior of states and other actors in the international system.
