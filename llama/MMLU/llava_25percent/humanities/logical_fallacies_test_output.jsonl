The ground is wet. Therefore, it must have rained.\" The alternative presented in the conclusion, \"it must have rained,\" is mutually exclusive with the alternative, \"it did not rain,\" and this is one of the rules used to test the validity of a conditional syllogism.\nSo the correct answer is (D) The alternatives presented must be mutually exclusive."}

It is possible for someone to make claims that are not necessarily consistent with their actions, and this may be relevant to the truth of their claims. However, whether someone is hypocritical is not necessarily relevant to their character, as it does not necessarily reflect on their overall integrity or honesty."}
