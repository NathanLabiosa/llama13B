The use of any means to defeat the aggressor could lead to excessive or disproportionate force.\n\n(C) The victim State may only use such means and force as it is necessary to defeat the aggressor.\n\nThis option is the correct answer because it requires the use of force to be proportionate to the attack, which means that the response should not be greater in magnitude than the attack.\n\n(D) The victim State can do nothing without Security Council approval.\n\nThis option is incorrect because it goes against the principle of self-defense, which allows a victim state to take necessary measures to defend itself from an attack."}

The principle is based on the idea that the ECHR should be a \"living instrument\" that evolves and adapts to changing circumstances and societal developments.\n\nCase (A) Golder v UK (1978) is a good example of the \"living instrument principle\" in action. In this case, the ECtHR held that the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 of the ECHR is not absolute, but rather is subject to certain limitations that are \"in accordance with the law.\" This decision allowed the court to adapt to changing societal attitudes and circumstances, such as the increasing recognition of the rights of same-sex couples.\n\nCase (B) A v UK (2009) also illustrates the \"living instrument principle.\" In this case, the ECtHR held that the right to life under Article 2 of the ECHR includes the right to access mental healthcare. This decision expanded the scope of the right to life and reflected the evolving understanding of the importance of mental health.\n\nCase (C) Goodwin v UK (2002) also shows the \"living instrument principle\" at work. In this case, the ECtHR held that the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the ECHR includes the right to receive information and ideas through the internet. This decision reflected the increasing importance of the internet in modern society and the need to protect freedom of expression in this context.\n\nCase (D) Osman v UK (1998) does not illustrate the \"living instrument principle\" as it involved the interpretation of Article 11 of the ECHR, which deals with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property. The case did not involve an expansion or evolution of the right to property, but rather a narrow interpretation of its scope.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Golder v UK (1978)."}

Instead, it applies to individuals who are acting in their official capacity, such as government officials.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because personal immunity is not limited to particular individuals, regardless of whether their conduct was undertaken in a private or public capacity. It applies to all individuals who are acting within the scope of their official duties.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because personal immunity is not limited to State officials for conduct undertaken in a public capacity.

Reservations can be made in writing or orally, and they must be compatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. If a reservation is made and it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty, it is considered invalid and the state making the reservation will not be bound by the treaty to the extent of the invalid reservation.\n\nOption (A) states that a reservation is invalid when the majority of the state parties objects to it, but this is not accurate. A reservation can be accepted or rejected by the other states parties, but its validity is determined by its compatibility with the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\nOption (B) states that a reservation is invalid only when an international tribunal says so, but this is not accurate either. An international tribunal can rule on the validity of a reservation, but the ultimate determination of its validity lies with the other state parties.\n\nOption (C) states that a reservation is invalid only when it is incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens), but this is also not accurate. A reservation can be considered invalid if it is incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law, but this is not the only condition for it to be invalid.\n\nIn summary, a reservation is considered invalid when it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. This determination is made by the other state parties, not an international tribunal, and not based on the majority of the state parties' objections."}

However, the Constitution of a country usually takes precedence over both domestic law and international law. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."}
