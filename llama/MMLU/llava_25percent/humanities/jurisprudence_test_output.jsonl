Being obliged to follow a rule means that members of the group are under an obligation to comply with it, and failure to comply can result in sanctions. Having an obligation, on the other hand, refers to the fact that the rule has the power to impose a duty of compliance on members of the group. It is the internal aspect of the rule that determines whether it has the power to impose a duty of compliance on members of the group.\nHart's distinction helps us to understand the nature of rules and the role they play in social life. It also helps us to understand the relationship between law and morality, as well as the role of power in the creation and enforcement of rules."}

The revival of natural law in the 20th century was largely driven by the recognition of human rights as a fundamental principle of international law. This recognition was largely inspired by the atrocities committed during World War II, including the Holocaust, which demonstrated the need for a more robust framework to protect human rights. The United Nations, in particular, played a key role in promoting and advocating for the recognition and protection of human rights around the world. Other factors, such as the depression of the 1930s and the rise of Fascism, may have also contributed to the revival of natural law, but the international recognition of human rights after World War II was the most significant factor."}

Hobbes believes that a strong, central authority is necessary to establish order, whereas Locke argues that individual rights and contractual agreements are the primary means of establishing order in society.\n\nHobbes (1651) argues that life in the state of nature is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short, and that a social contract is necessary to escape this state. He believes that the Leviathan, or the central authority, has the power to enforce laws and maintain order. Locke (1689), on the other hand, argues that individuals have natural rights and that they enter into social contracts to protect those rights. He believes that the role of the courts is to enforce the terms of the social contract and protect individual rights.\n\nIn contrast, Hobbes and Locke's views on the role of law in society are similar, as they both believe that law is necessary for the maintenance of order. They also agree that contractual obligations are important in society. However, they differ in their attitudes towards the role of the courts in maintaining order.\n\nOverall, the principal difference between Hobbes and Locke is their attitude towards the role of the courts in maintaining order, with Hobbes advocating for a strong central authority and Locke advocating for individual rights and contractual agreements."}

In support of animal rights, Regan argues that animals have inherent worth, which means that they have the same moral status as humans and are entitled to the same rights and respect. This view is based on the idea that animals have consciousness, self-consciousness, and the ability to experience pleasure and pain, and that their lives have inherent value.\n\nRegan's sentimental anthropomorphicism is a central aspect of his argument for animal rights, and it is based on the idea that humans have a natural empathy and compassion towards animals, and that this should be extended to moral considerations. This view is in contrast to (B) the social contract includes animals and their welfare, (C) the suffering of a few animals may in principle be justified by the pleasure of or benefit to the many, and (D) Cruelty to animals is a reflection of the barbarity of a society.

Gemeinschaft refers to a traditional, face-to-face community based on personal relationships and shared values, where individuals have a sense of belonging and interdependence. In contrast, Gesellschaft refers to a modern, impersonal society based on formal associations and individual self-interest, where people interact mainly through market transactions and formal institutions.\n\nChoice (A) is incorrect because both Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft can be democratic or autocratic depending on the specific context.\nChoice (B) is incorrect because both Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft can exist in civil society or civic society.\nChoice (D) is incorrect because the distinction between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft is not based on transparency or openness of government.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Gemeinschaft is a society based on community, Gesellschaft one based on association."}

This perspective acknowledges that human rights are important, but they are not absolute and must be balanced against the needs and interests of the community.

This approach to law is different from a conceptual approach, which is more focused on the abstract nature of law and its underlying principles.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because Austin's theory does not neglect the importance of morality. In fact, he argues that morality is closely tied to law, and that law is successful when it reflects moral norms and values.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because Austin's model of a legal system is not based on an anachronistic view of legal history. He sees law as a living and evolving system that is shaped by its users and that adapts to changing circumstances.\n\nOption (D) is also incorrect because Austin's theory includes a role for law in economic relations, but it is not the primary focus of his analysis. Instead, he sees law as a way to regulate social interactions and to promote cooperation and mutual understanding between individuals and groups."}
