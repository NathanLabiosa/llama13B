A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample. A simple random sample is a method of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a larger population in such a way that every individual or item in the population has an equal chance of being selected. The size of the sample depends on the population size and the desired level of precision and power of the sample. A sample that is too small may not be representative of the population, and a sample that is too large may be impractical to use."}

{"question": "A company has a choice of three investment schemes. Option I gives a sure $25,000 return on investment.

In this case, x = 2.40 (the student's time in seconds) and \u03bc and \u03c3 are unknown. However, since the student's time is already in minutes, we can convert the time to minutes by dividing it by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\nThe standardized score in minutes will also be in minutes, so we can simply multiply the standardized score in seconds by 60 to convert it to minutes. Therefore, the student's standardized score in minutes will be 2.40 \\* 60 = 144.\nThus, the correct answer is (D) z = 2.40, which corresponds to the student's standardized score in seconds."}

Out of the remaining 80 workers, only 5% will leave during the next year, which is 4 workers.

The t-statistic is calculated by taking the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized mean, divided by the standard deviation. In this case, the t-statistic is 4.3 - 4.0 = 0.3 ounces, and the standard deviation is 0.6 ounces. The standard deviation is used to find the Z-score, which is the t-statistic divided by the standard deviation, and then we use the t-distribution table to find the p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a sample mean as extreme or more extreme than the sample mean if the null hypothesis is true.\nThe closest p-value to the calculated t-statistic is 0.0026, which is the 2.5% p-value. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Therefore, the new fertilizer has increased the mean weight of the apples compared to the old fertilizer."}

This scheme uses binary variables, which can easily represent the success or failure of selling a policy to a customer. By assigning a 0 to successful sales and a 1 to unsuccessful sales, it is easy to calculate the proportion of successful sales (20%) and the number of customers needed to contact to achieve a sale (20/30 = 2/3 or 2/3 \\* 30 = 15 customers).\nSimilarly, if you want to calculate the expected number of customers the insurance agent needs to contact before selling a policy, you can calculate the sum of the probabilities of selling a policy on the first and second contacts: (0.2 \\* 30 + 0.8 \\* 30) = 45. If the agent needs to contact 15 customers before selling a policy, then the expected value of the number of customers contacted is 45.\nThis method is simple and easy to understand, and it provides a quick estimate of the number of customers the agent needs to contact to achieve a sale. It is a common technique used in simulation to estimate the expected value of a random variable."}

The number of categories is 4, and the costs are independent, so we can calculate the standard deviation as follows:\n\n\u03c3 = sqrt(((4500^2) + (350^2) + (2800^2) + (675^2)) / 4)\n\n= sqrt((225000 + 1000 + 8000 + 1725) / 4)\n\n= sqrt(31750 / 4)\n\n= sqrt(7925)\n\n= 24\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the total student costs is 24.
