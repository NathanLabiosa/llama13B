It states that the loop gain of the circuit should be greater than unity, and the phase of the feedback signal with respect to the input should be either 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0. The loop gain is a measure of how much the gain of the circuit changes as it is repeated. If the loop gain is greater than unity, the circuit will oscillate, but if it is less than unity, the circuit will not oscillate. The phase of the feedback signal is the amount of delay between the input signal and the feedback signal. If the phase is either 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0, it will reinforce the input signal and cause the circuit to oscillate. Therefore, both A and C are correct."}
{"question": "Potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It loads the circuit moderately."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It loads the circuit to maximum extent."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It uses centre zero galvanometer instead of voltmeter."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It does not load the circuit at all."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "Choice (C) is the correct answer. Potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement loads the circuit to a maximum extent, while the direct measurement using a voltmeter does not load the circuit at all.\n\nHere is why:\nA potentiometer is an electrical component that resembles a rheostat, but it has a sliding or rotating contact that can measure voltage. To measure DC voltage using a potentiometer, the circuit is connected across the potentiometer's two fixed terminals and the sliding or rotating contact (wiper) is connected to a voltmeter. This method of measurement loads the circuit by creating a series resistance between the circuit and the voltmeter, which can affect the accuracy of the measurement.\nOn the other hand, direct measurement using a voltmeter involves simply connecting the voltmeter across the circuit's terminals without any additional components. This method does not load the circuit at all, as the voltmeter has its own internal impedance that is much higher than the resistance created by the circuit. This means that the potential drop across the circuit is minimal, ensuring that the measurement is accurate and unloading the circuit.\nTherefore, choice (C) \"It uses center zero galvanometer instead of voltmeter\" is incorrect because it assumes that the potentiometer method uses a center zero galvanometer, which is not necessarily true. The correct answer is (A) \"It loads the circuit moderately.\""}

The source voltage is a sine wave with a frequency of 60 Hz and a period of 1/2 cycle (314\u00b0).\nFor the load counter emf of 200 V, we can calculate the maximum counter emf value by multiplying the source voltage amplitude by the load counter emf:\nE\\_max = 200 V x 0.7854 V/Hz = 157 V\nSince the counter emf is positive, we know that the firing angle must be within 180 degrees for the counter emf to be generated.\nNow, we need to determine the range of firing angle control. We can do this by calculating the range of values for the source voltage amplitude in each period of the waveform.\nThe period of the sinusoidal waveform is 1/2 cycle or 314\u00b0, and the firing angle control range is from 0 to 314 degrees. Since the source voltage is a sine wave, the voltage amplitude varies from zero to the maximum amplitude in each period.\nThe maximum voltage amplitude is 157 V, and its period is also 314\u00b0. Therefore, the range of voltage amplitude values in each period is from 0 V to 157 V, which corresponds to a range of firing angles from 0\u00b0 to 157\u00b0.\nSince the counter emf is positive, the firing angle must be within 180\u00b0 for the counter emf to be generated. This means that the range of firing angle control is from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0."}

The voltage used in directional heating depends on the size and complexity of the heating system, as well as the insulation and temperature requirements of the object being heated.\nIn general, higher voltage means lower current, so a higher voltage should be used to minimize heat loss and maximize efficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is 66 KV, which is a relatively high voltage that can be used to efficiently heat large or complex objects.\nThe other options are either too low or too high to be used effectively for directional heating. 1.5 KV is too low and would require excessive current, which would lead to high heat loss, while 15 KV is too high and would require high current, which would lead to high losses due to resistance. 33 KV is also too high for most directional heating applications."}

This is because the output of the bridge is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the series resistance and the parallel resistance. If we interchange the positions of the detector and the source, the output of the bridge will still be equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the series resistance and the parallel resistance, so the bridge will still remain balanced.\nThe other options are not related to the theorem that states that the bridge will remain balanced if the positions of the detector and the source are interchanged.

The luminous intensity is the luminous flux per unit area, measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m^2). The area of the room is 4 meters x 3 meters = 12 square meters.\nThe desired illuminance level is 50 lux, which is equal to 50 cd/m^2. Therefore, the required luminous flux is 50 cd/m^2 \\* 12 m^2 = 600 lumens.\nSince we need to achieve an average illuminance of 50 lux on the entire room, we need to multiply the required luminous flux by the area of the room to get the total required luminous flux: 600 lm \\* 12 m^2 = 7200 lm.\nHowever, since lamps typically have a maximum output of 100% and are usually used at a lower output, we need to divide the total required luminous flux by the output of the lamp to get the number of lamps required: 7200 lm / (lamps output \\* 100%) = 4.9 lamps.\nSince we need whole numbers, we round up to 5 lamps.

It is often used with a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) because SCRs can be sensitive to voltage spikes. The snubber circuit is connected either in series or parallel with the SCR to reduce the voltage spikes and prevent damage to the SCR. The choice of whether to connect the snubber circuit in series or parallel depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the SCR and the load it is connected to. The purpose of the snubber circuit is to clamp the voltage and current waveforms and to reduce the voltage spikes that can damage the SCR and other components in the circuit."}
{"question": "The number of rings in the Bohr model of any element is determined by what?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Column number on periodic table."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Atomic mass."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Row number on periodic table."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Atomic number."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Atomic number.\n\nThe Bohr model of an element is the simplest model for the structure of an atom and it is based on the idea that electrons are in energy levels, or shells, around the nucleus. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom of that element, which determines the element's unique identity. So, the number of rings in the Bohr model is determined by the atomic number of the element, not by the column number, atomic mass, or row number on the periodic table."}

Crystal oscillators are widely used in monolithic ICs because they are easy to fabricate, have high stability, and low cost. They are based on the resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material, such as quartz, and require no external power source or active components. The Hartley oscillator (B) is a type of oscillator that can be fabricated in a monolithic IC but is not as common as the crystal oscillator. The Wien bridge oscillator (C) is an active oscillator that requires a charge pump and operational amplifiers, and is therefore not as easily fabricated in a monolithic IC.
