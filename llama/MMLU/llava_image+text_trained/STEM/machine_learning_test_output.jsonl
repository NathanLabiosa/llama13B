Support vector machines also give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example. This is because in a support vector machine, the classification is determined by finding the hyperplane that separates the data into the two classes with the maximum margin. The hyperplane can be seen as a decision boundary that divides the data into two regions, and within each region, the proportion of data belonging to a certain class can be seen as a probability distribution over the possible labels.\n\nOn the other hand, statement 2 is false. The support vectors in a support vector machine are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and determine the maximum margin between the two classes. The support vectors can change as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels. This is because the degree of the polynomial kernel can affect the shape of the hyperplane and the data points that lie closest to it. So, the support vectors can shift depending on the choice of kernel.\n\nIn summary, statement 1 is true, and statement 2 is false."}

It's not guaranteed, however, that this will always lead to better performance.\nStatement 2: The VC dimension of a Perceptron is smaller than the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM. The VC dimension measures the number of decision boundaries required to separate all pairs of data points with a given degree of accuracy. A Perceptron has a VC dimension of 1, while a simple linear SVM can have a VC dimension equal to the number of features.

On the other hand, if we use priors estimated from the data, the classifier will be more sensitive to small changes in the data, but may be less prone to underfitting if the true data distribution is similar to the prior.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C)."}
{"question": "Statement 1| For any two variables x and y having joint distribution p(x, y), we always have H[x, y] \u2265 H[x] + H[y] where H is entropy function.

H(x, y) is the joint entropy of x and y, and H(x) is the entropy of x.\nNow, let's understand what it means for a joint distribution p(x, y) to satisfy the condition in the statement. For any pair of x and y, the joint probability distribution p(x, y) contains information about both variables, and the entropy of this distribution is the sum of the entropy of x and the entropy of y.\nSo, if we have two variables x and y, and we have a joint distribution p(x, y), we can write the entropy H(x) as H(x) = H(x, y) - p(x, y) \\* log(1/p(x, y)). Similarly, we can write H(y) = H(x, y) - p(x, y) \\* log(1/p(x, y)).\nNow, let's consider the moralization step, which is the process of removing the edges in the graph. If we moralize a directed graph, we may end up with a new graph that contains fewer edges than the original graph, but the entropy of the new graph will still be equal to the sum of the entropies of its vertices.\nTherefore, if we moralize a graph G that has edges connecting vertices x and y, we will end up with two disconnected vertices x and y in the moralized graph. The moralized graph will still contain the same joint entropy as the original graph, which is H(x, y) = H(x) + H(y).\nSince H(x, y) = H(x) + H(y) and moralization decreases the number of edges in the graph, we can conclude that the moralized graph has fewer edges than the original graph. This means that if we moralize G, we will have H(x, y) > H(x) + H(y), which is not true for the given statement. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) True, True."}
