This would result in an understatement of assets, specifically the cost of goods sold (COGS) or inventory. If the merchandise was included in the year-end physical inventory, then it was already accounted for as an asset on the balance sheet.\nTherefore, the effect of not reporting the purchase of merchandise is that the asset value of the merchandise is overstated, but the cost of goods sold is still understated. This would result in an Understated Understated effect on the balance sheet."}

We can do this by setting up the following equation:Total Sales Revenue = Total Fixed Costs + Desired ProfitTotal Sales Revenue = Total Fixed Costs + (10% of Sales Revenue)First, we need to find the total fixed costs. We are given that Spark has monthly fixed costs of $3000, and they need to sell 1300 phones to cover both fixed costs and desired profit. We can calculate the total fixed costs as follows:Total Fixed Costs = Monthly Fixed Costs x Number of Phones Sold = $3000 x 1300 = $3,900,000.Now, we can use the equation for total sales revenue to find the number of phones needed to cover both fixed costs and desired profit:Total Sales Revenue = Total Fixed Costs + (10% of Sales Revenue) = $3,900,000 + (10% of $3,900,000) = $3,900,000 + $390,000 = $4,290,000.So, Spark needs to sell 1300 phones to cover both fixed costs and desired profit. Answer: \nTo find the number of phones needed to cover fixed costs only, we can rearrange the equation for total sales revenue as follows:Number of Phones Sold = $3,900,000 / ($200 - $25) = 1800.So, Spark needs to sell 1800 phones to cover only fixed costs and not include the desired profit.

Inherent risk is the basis or natural tendency of a process to produce errors or irregularities, while control risk is the likelihood of errors or irregularities occurring due to the failure of internal controls. The auditor uses these two components to calculate the overall audit risk and determine the extent of testing needed to achieve reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatements.\n\nThe auditor has control over inherent risk and control risk, as they are subjective measures that rely on the auditor's judgment. They use their knowledge of the industry, company, and environment to assess inherent risk and determine the appropriate level of control risk. Inherent risk and control risk are not calculated by the client, and they do not exist independently of the audit.\n\nMateriality is another important concept in auditing, but it is not related to inherent risk or control risk. Materiality is the extent to which an omission or misstatement in the financial statements is significant enough to affect the decisions of users of the financial statements.

The sales journal would show the sales transactions that have been recorded, while the shipping documents would show the actual shipments that have been made. By comparing these two sets of records, the auditor can identify any discrepancies that may indicate an overstatement of sales.\nFor example, if the sales journal shows that a certain product was sold for $100, but the shipping documents show that only $80 worth of product was shipped, this could indicate an overstatement of sales.

In this case, the cost of the copyright is $20000, and the legal life of the copyright is 55 years (the author's life plus 50 years). The annual amortization expense would be $20000 / 55 = $367.\nHowever, Corbet only expects to sell the book for five years, so the amortization expense should be adjusted to reflect the remaining time. The amortization expense for the five-year period would be $367 \\* 5 = $1835.\nTherefore, the total amortization expense that Corbet should report at the end of the current year is $1835. Choice (A) $0 is incorrect because the amortization expense should be reported, and choice (B) $400 is incorrect because the annual amortization expense should be multiplied by the remaining number of years to get the total amortization expense. Choice (C) $500 is also incorrect because the annual amortization expense should be a percentage of the original cost, which is $20000, not $25000."}

The shareholder's basis in the equipment is $6,000, and the fair market value (FMV) of the equipment is $20,000. The FMV of the equipment exceeds the shareholder's basis, so there is no gain recognized by the shareholder. The shareholder's basis in the equipment is increased to the FMV of the equipment, which is $20,000. This means that the $12,000 liability is subtracted from the FMV of the equipment, leaving a $8,000 gain. However, the gain is entirely offset by the shareholder's basis in the equipment, so there is no gain recognized in this case."}

Capitalizing the cost means that it is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and depreciated over time, which allows for the allocation of the cost over the useful life of the equipment.\nThis treatment recognizes that the equipment has alternative future uses beyond the research and development project, and it is expected that the cost will be recovered through the use of the equipment over its useful life. It also provides a more accurate reflection of the cost of the research and development activities, as it is not expensed in the year that the project starts.\nIn contrast, expensing the cost in the year that the research and development project starts would result in an immediate charge to income, which may not accurately reflect the cost of the equipment and may not provide an accurate picture of the company's research and development activities.

This is because the omission of material accounts receivable can have a significant impact on the financial statements and the reputation of the company. The CPA should provide a detailed explanation of the issue and the steps they are taking to rectify the situation. The CPA should also consider whether additional procedures are needed to verify account balances and whether any adjustments need to be made to the financial statements.

Therefore, the company must credit additional paid-in capital and debit retained earnings to account for the increased equity resulting from the stock dividend.\nIn this case, the company declares a 30% stock dividend on 1,000 shares of $1 par common stock outstanding, which means the company is issuing 300 additional shares of common stock for every 100 shares outstanding. The total number of shares outstanding increases to 1,300 shares.\nSince the total value of the stock dividend is $300, which is the result of multiplying the number of shares by the percentage of the dividend and the par value per share, the company must debit retained earnings for $300 to account for the increased equity resulting from the stock dividend. The other options are incorrect because:\n(A) Treasury stock is not involved in this scenario and should not be debited or credited.\n(B) Additional paid-in capital is the amount by which the par value of the stock exceeds the value of the paid-in capital, and in this case, the par value per share is $1, so the amount by which the par value exceeds the value of the paid-in capital is $1 x 300/1000 = $1, which is not enough to require a credit to additional paid-in capital.\n(D) Common stock is not involved in this scenario and should not be debited or credited."}

When a business sells something on credit, it typically gives the customer an invoice with a due date. The customer pays the invoice at a later date, and the amount paid is considered an account receivable for the business.\n\nMarketable securities, machinery and equipment, and inventory are also considered capital assets for federal income tax purposes. Marketable securities are investments that can be bought and sold quickly, such as stocks or bonds. Machinery and equipment are used in a business, and inventory is goods that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\nTherefore, the choices (A) Accounts receivable, (B) Marketable securities, and (C) Machinery and equipment used in a business are all correct, while (D) Inventory is not a capital asset for federal income tax purposes."}

According to the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), transmitting a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization is crucial for fostering a culture of integrity and trust. One of the most effective ways to do this is by demonstrating appropriate behavior by example. This means that leaders and employees at all levels of the organization should model ethical behavior in their words and actions. This can include things like being honest, transparent, respectful, and accountable, and avoiding conflicts of interest, insider trading, and other unethical practices. By demonstrating ethical behavior, leaders and employees can help to set the tone for the organization and create a culture that values integrity and trust."}

In the current year, Bailey should report the insurance policy as a $120,000 debit to a prepaid asset and a $60,000 credit to insurance expense. This is because Bailey paid $240,000 for the four-year insurance policy in advance in the prior year, and it will be expensed over the four years. The $120,000 will be expensed in the current year, and the remaining $60,000 will be expensed in the following years.\n2. The prepaid asset will be amortized over the four years of the insurance policy. The cost of insurance for each year will be reflected in the income statement as an expense. The cost of the insurance policy will be recognized in the balance sheet as a $120,000 credit to prepaid insurance and a $240,000 debit to insurance expense.\n3"}

This is done to prevent double taxation or overstatement of income in one period due to the recognition of income from certain sources in another period. In this context, discontinued operations refers to the profits or losses from a significant event or transaction that is not part of the company's ongoing operations and is not expected to recur in the future. These profits or losses are usually recognized separately from the company's continuing operations and are not subject to intraperiod income tax allocation."}

This is because the legal fees are directly attributable to the acquisition or development of a long-term asset (the patent), and they are necessary to maintain the company's right to the patent. If the outcome of the litigation is successful, the company has successfully defended its patent rights, and the legal fees were necessary for that successful defense. Therefore, the legal fees should be capitalized as incurred.\nIf the outcome of the litigation is unsuccessful, the legal fees should not be capitalized, because the company has not successfully defended its patent rights. Similarly, if the outcome of the litigation is unknown or not determinative, the legal fees should not be capitalized until the outcome of the litigation is known.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: (D) No Yes."}
