This causes the contents of the cell to spill out, which can lead to further damage and ultimately cell death.\n\nViruses are obligate intracellular parasites, which means they rely on host cells to survive and replicate. To infect a cell, a virus must first enter and release its genetic material (genome) into the cell's cytoplasm. Once inside the cell, the virus's genetic material interacts with the cell's own machinery, often using viral enzymes to do so. This can lead to several different outcomes, including:\n- Induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) via caspases (B).\n- Fragmentation of the cellular DNA (C), which can interfere with the proper functioning of the cell and potentially lead to cell death.\n- Blocking of cellular transcription (D) by binding to the host cell's transcription factors, which can prevent the cell from producing the necessary proteins to survive.\n- Dissolving the cellular membrane (A) to release the genetic material into the cytoplasm, which can then infect other cells.\n\nOverall, viruses use various strategies to infect and kill cells, but the most common method is by dissolving the cellular membrane."}

During this phase, patients are not showing any symptoms of the disease, but they are still infected and can transmit the virus to others. Vaccines work by exposing the body's immune system to a small, harmless piece of the virus or bacteria, which triggers the body to produce antibodies to fight the infection. However, HIV's ability to enter a latent state makes it difficult to develop a vaccine that can effectively prevent infection or eliminate the virus from the body. While other factors such as antigenic variability and the high cost of developing a vaccine may also contribute to the challenge of developing an effective HIV vaccine, latency is the primary reason why there is currently no vaccine against HIV."}

Preventing infection: By introducing a small, controlled amount of a virus or bacteria to the body, a vaccine can help the immune system develop immunity to that pathogen, protecting against future infections.\n2. Preventing disease: When a person is protected against a pathogen, they are less likely to develop the disease it causes, which can lead to serious health complications or even death.\n3. Preventing transmission: Vaccines can also help prevent the spread of diseases by reducing the number of people who become infected and can transmit the pathogen to others.\n4. Providing herd immunity: When a large percentage of a population is immune to a particular disease, it can provide herd immunity, which protects vulnerable populations, such as young children, elderly individuals, and people with compromised immune systems, from contracting the disease.\nIn summary, vaccination has several goals, including preventing infection, disease, transmission, and providing herd immunity."}

{"question": "What is the genetic structure of rotavirus?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Circular DNA containing virus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "RNA virus with RT"}, {"label": "C", "text": "ds RNA virus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "ds RNA virus in segments"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) ds RNA virus.\nRotavirus is a small, single-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the Reoviridae family. It is one of the most common causes of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children, and it can also cause diarrhea in adults. The genetic structure of rotavirus is characterized by its double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule, which encodes the genetic information necessary for viral replication and function. The virus has a circular DNA containing genome, and it has a large replicase complex that is responsible for the synthesis of new dsRNA. Rotavirus also has a reverse transcriptase enzyme, which can synthesize new dsRNA from an infected cell's mRNA, allowing the virus to replicate even when its own genetic material is not present. Overall, the genetic structure of rotavirus is characteristic of a dsRNA virus, which is why option (C) is the correct answer."}
