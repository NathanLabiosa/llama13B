The ability of a restriction enzyme to cleave double-stranded DNA depends on its recognition site, also known as the recognition sequence.\nIf a restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4-base sequence in DNA and the recognition site is present on both strands of the DNA, the enzyme will cleave the DNA at the recognition site. The number of fragments produced by the restriction enzyme will depend on the length of the recognition site and the length of the DNA molecule.\nIn this case, the genome size of the bacteriophage is 5,000 base pairs (bp), and the restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4-base sequence.

In the case of body mass index (BMI), known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can explain a small but significant portion of the variation in BMI despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies. In other words, the proportion of variation in BMI that can be explained by known SNPs is less than 2%."}

This difference in genetic material can affect gene expression and establish a pattern in the developing embryo as the cells divide and differentiate. The other choices are not directly related to the differential distribution of substances in the egg."}
{"question": "Which of the following conditions is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Achondroplasia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Crouzon syndrome"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thanatophoric dysplasia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Waardenburg syndrome"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "rect answer is (B) Crouzon syndrome.\n\nMutations in the FGFR3 gene are known to cause several conditions, including achondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and a variety of craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities. However, Crouzon syndrome is caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene, which is different from FGFR3. FGFR3 mutations are associated with achondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, hypochondrogenesis, and other related conditions, but not Crouzon syndrome."}
