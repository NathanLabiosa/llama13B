This type of injury can also result in paralysis of the muscles responsible for breathing, which can make it difficult or impossible to breathe without assistance from a ventilator. In some cases, the injury may also affect the muscles responsible for coughing or clearing secretions, making it difficult to clear the airways and leading to respiratory failure. Therefore, it is important to seek immediate medical attention for a patient with a cervical spinal cord injury, and life support measures may be necessary to help the patient breathe until they can receive further treatment."}

Mucous membranes are one of the body's first lines of defense against infection and are equipped with special cells and enzymes that can destroy harmful bacteria. Hair in the nose and sinuses can also help to prevent bacteria from entering the body, and saliva can help to neutralize harmful bacteria that have entered the body by killing them with an enzyme called lysozyme.

The pupillary light reflex is a reflex that causes the pupils to constrict in response to increased lighting. The afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is carried by the oculomotor nerve, while the efferent limb is carried by the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve, which causes the pupils to dilate. The reflex is mediated by the retina and the pretectal nucleus in the midbrain. The inferior colliculi in the midbrain play a role in the pupillary light reflex, but they are not the primary site of mediation. The pupillary light reflex is a simple reflex, not a consensual reflex, which means that it does not require input from multiple receptors to elicit a response."}

This is because the damage to the internal capsule can disrupt the normal communication between the brain and the muscles in the leg, leading to muscle spasms and stiffness. Other symptoms that may be present include weakness, loss of reflexes (hyporeflexia), and loss of muscle tone (flaccidity). Tremors are not a common symptom of a CVA."}

In a spiral fracture, the bone is displaced and may be visible through the skin.\nA greenstick fracture, on the other hand, is a type of fracture in which the bone is bent but not fully displaced, and the skin is usually intact. Greenstick fractures are usually caused by low-energy trauma, such as a fall from a height or a tripping accident.\nA complex, comminuted fracture is a severe fracture in which the bone is broken into multiple pieces and is often associated with high-energy trauma.\nA compound fracture is a type of fracture in which the bone is broken and the skin is pierced, often due to high-energy trauma. Compound fractures are often associated with open wounds and may require surgical repair."}
{"question": "Fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon occurs in which of the following structures?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cervix"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fallopian tube"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ovary"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Uterus"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Uterus. Fertilization of an ovum (egg cell) by a spermatozoon (sperm cell) occurs in the fallopian tube, which is the structure that connects the ovary to the uterus. The spermatozoa must travel through the cervix and into the fallopian tube to reach the ovum, which is released from the ovary during ovulation and travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. Once the spermatozoa and ovum meet, they fuse to form a zygote, which then travels to the uterus and implants in the lining of the uterus to begin development into a fetus."}

{"question": "In men, which of the following structures is located at the neck of the bladder and surrounds the urethra?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Epididymis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Prostate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Scrotum"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Seminal vesicle"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Seminal vesicle.\nThe seminal vesicle is a pair of structures located on each side of the bladder in men. They play an important role in the reproduction process by producing and storing semen, which is ejaculated during sexual intercourse. The seminal vesicles are located at the neck of the bladder and surround the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body.\nThe epididymis is a structure located at the back of the testis in men, and it plays a role in the maturation and storage of sperm. The prostate is a gland located beneath the bladder in men, and it plays a role in the ejaculation of semen. The scrotum is the pouch of skin that contains the testes in men, and it helps to regulate the temperature of the testes."}
{"question": "Which of the following options completes the following statement? \"The right atrioventricular valve\u2026\"", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "is a semilunar valve"}, {"label": "B", "text": "is prevented from everting by papillary muscles."}, {"label": "C", "text": "is open during systole."}, {"label": "D", "text": "prevents blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) is a semilunar valve. The right atrioventricular (AV) valve is one of the four valves in the human heart, and it plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow between the right atrium and the right ventricle. The other three valves are the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve. Semilunar valves are situated between the heart's chambers and have a cusp that looks like half a moon. They are unique to mammals and play a vital role in ensuring proper blood flow and regulation of blood pressure."}
{"question": "Which one of the following brain areas is supplied by branches of the subclavian arteries?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The frontal lobe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The parietal lobe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The hypothalamus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The cerebellum"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) The frontal lobe.\nThe frontal lobe is the area of the brain responsible for higher-level cognitive functions such as decision-making, planning, and problem-solving. It is also involved in motor control, language, and social behavior. The frontal lobe is supplied by branches of the subclavian arteries, which are major arteries that arise from the brachial artery in the armpit and supply blood to the upper limbs and head. The subclavian arteries deliver oxygenated blood to the frontal lobe and other areas of the brain. The parietal lobe, hypothalamus, and cerebellum are also important brain regions with distinct functions, but they are not supplied by branches of the subclavian arteries."}
{"question": "Which of the following structures is part of the small intestine?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ascending colon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cecum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ileum"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sigmoid colon"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Ileum. The ileum is the final section of the small intestine, located between the jejunum and the cecum. It is responsible for the absorption of nutrients and fluids, as well as the transport of waste products to the large intestine. The ascending colon is located on the right side of the abdomen and is responsible for the absorption of water and electrolytes from the blood. The cecum is a pouch-like structure that connects the small intestine to the large intestine and is responsible for the first stage of digestion. The sigmoid colon is located in the lower part of the abdomen and is responsible for the final stages of digestion and the storage of waste products before they are eliminated from the body."}
{"question": "During an inferior alveolar nerve block the needle ideally passes", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "posterior and medial to medial pterygoid."}, {"label": "B", "text": "anterior and lateral to medial pterygoid."}, {"label": "C", "text": "through medial pterygoid."}, {"label": "D", "text": "inferior to medial pterygoid."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "Answer: C) through medial pterygoid.\nExplanation: During an inferior alveolar nerve block, the needle should be directed through the medial pterygoid muscle, which is the ideal location for passing the needle. The medial pterygoid muscle is a large muscle that is easy to locate and insert the needle into, which helps to minimize the risk of injury to the nerve or surrounding structures. The posterior and medial pterygoid muscle and anterior and lateral to medial pterygoid muscles are not ideal locations for passing the needle during an inferior alveolar nerve block. Therefore, option C) through medial pterygoid is the correct answer."}
