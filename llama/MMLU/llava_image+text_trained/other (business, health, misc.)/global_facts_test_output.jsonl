{"question": "As of 2015, about what percentage of the world\u2019s land area is forested?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "15%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "30%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "45%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "60%"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) 15%.\nAs of 2015, approximately 15% of the world's land area was forested, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). This figure represents the total area covered by forests on land globally. The percentage of forested land can vary significantly depending on the region, with some areas having higher forest cover and others having little or no forest cover at all. The global forest cover has been declining over the years due to deforestation and forest degradation caused by human activities, such as agriculture, urbanization, and infrastructure development. Conserving and managing forests are essential to mitigate climate change, protect biodiversity, and support the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on forests for their well-being and livelihoods."}
