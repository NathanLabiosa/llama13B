In contrast, a Team culture is one in which workers are organized into teams that work together to achieve specific goals. A Collaborative culture is one in which workers are encouraged to work together and share ideas to achieve a common goal. A Group culture is one in which workers are organized into groups that work together to achieve specific goals. All of these types of cultures promote teamwork and collaboration, but a Collective culture is the most focused on the collective good and acceptance of change."}

The Contingency Theory of motivation suggests that people's behavior is based on the fit between their needs and the rewards offered by their environment. This means that people are more likely to behave in certain ways when the rewards they receive are consistent with their needs, and less likely to behave in certain ways when the rewards are not consistent with their needs. The Contingency Theory of motivation was developed by Andrew J. Melin in the 1950s and 1960s."}
{"question": "What is the term for decisions limited by human capacity to absorb and analyse information?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cognitive rationality"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Conscious rationality"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bounded rationality"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Restricted rationality"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Bounded rationality. Bounded rationality is a psychological concept that refers to the limitations on the ability of humans to process and analyze information effectively. It is based on the idea that people make decisions based on the information and options that are available to them, rather than on a complete and unbiased analysis of all the available information. Bounded rationality can lead to biases and errors in decision-making, and it is an important concept in fields such as behavioral economics and decision theory."}

The purpose of an organisational structure is to help a company or organisation achieve its goals effectively and efficiently. It provides a framework for organising and allocating resources, such as people, money, and materials. An effective organisational structure should support the company's goals and objectives, and help ensure that everyone is working towards the same end. It should also help to coordinate and communicate within the organisation, as well as to manage and formalise authority and decision-making. It should not be used to limit workers' rights or to formalise a rigid hierarchy."}

This approach argues that strategic planning is not effective, and that instead, organizations should focus on being adaptive and flexible in response to changing circumstances and opportunities.\nThe main proponents of this approach are Henry Mintzberg, C.K. Prahalad, and Gary Hamel, who are all known for their criticisms of traditional strategic planning and for advocating for more agile and adaptive approaches to strategy development. Michael Porter, on the other hand, is known for his work on competitive strategy and has argued for the importance of strategic planning in achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. Milton Friedman, meanwhile, is known for his work on corporate social responsibility and has argued that organizations have a responsibility to their shareholders to be successful, although he has not addressed the issue of strategic planning directly.\nIt is worth noting that there is ongoing debate among scholars and practitioners about the effectiveness of strategic planning and whether it is still relevant in today's fast-changing business environment."}
