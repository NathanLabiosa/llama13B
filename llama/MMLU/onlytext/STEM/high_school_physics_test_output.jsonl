The strength of the electric field at a point near the charged object is determined by the amount of charge on the object and the distance from the object to the point. The electric field produced by a charged object decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the object.\nSo, if one distance is twice as long as another distance, the electric field produced by a charged object will be one-fourth as strong at the longer distance as it is at the shorter distance.\nA magnetic field is created when an electric current flows through a wire. The strength of the magnetic field at a point near a current-carrying wire is determined by the amount of current in the wire and the distance from the wire to the point. The magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire decreases as the inverse distance from the wire.\nSo, if one distance is halved, the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire will be four times as strong at the closer distance than it is at the farther distance.\nSOLUTION: The electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the cylinder for distances far from the cylinder.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nThe number of molecules in a container is called the number of moles of molecules. The number of moles of molecules is important because it determines the pressure and density of a gas.\nPressure is a measure of the force exerted by a gas. Imagine pushing on a gas. The harder you push, the more the gas expands. The pressure of a gas is higher when it expands more.\nDensity is a measure of the mass of a substance per unit of volume.

Imagine looking at a picture of a sandcastle. The sand is below the castle.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nConsider the density of the two gases. Density is less for the hydrogen gas than for the nitrogen gas. So, the hydrogen gas is less dense than the nitrogen gas.\nNow consider the pressures of the gases. The pressures are equal for the hydrogen gas and the nitrogen gas. So, the average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is equal to the average force exerted on the container by the nitrogen gas."}

The electric field strength at the distance midway between the charges is found by first calculating the net charge at that distance and then dividing by the distance.\nThe net charge at the distance midway between the charges is found by subtracting the charges from each other.\nSo, the net charge is 4.0 nC - 4.0 nC = 0 nC.\nThe distance midway between the charges is 2.0 cm.\nThe electric field strength at a distance of 2.0 cm from a 4.0 nC charge is 9.0 \u00d7 10^4 N/C.\nTherefore, the electric field strength at the point midway between the charges is 9.0 \u00d7 10^4 N/C."}

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery substance is made of one or more chemical elements. A substance may be composed of only one chemical element, or it may be composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.\nSOLUTION: Water has more molecules per volume than air. So, water has more molecular interactions per volume than air. Molecular interactions are when different molecules interact with each other. These interactions can transfer heat from one substance to another.\nFor this reason, water can move heat faster than air. So, water can cool a person down more quickly than air can. This is the primary reason why a person can stand outside on a cold day for hours without ill effect, but falling into a cold lake can kill a person in a matter of minutes."}

The work function is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from the metal. As the energy of an incident photon increases, the work function can be increased to greater values.\nAs the work function of a metal increases, the minimum energy that an incident photon must have to cause an electron to be emitted from the metal also increases.\nThe photoelectric effect coefficient of a metal is a property of the metal.

The weight is a combination of the object's mass and the strength of the gravity.\nThe weight of an object on Earth is different at different places.

Speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Acceleration tells you how quickly the object's speed is changing.\nAn object is in free fall when it is only subject to the force of gravity. An object in free fall has constant acceleration. The acceleration of an object in free fall causes the object's speed to increase. But the object's speed does not increase at a greater rate.

A concave mirror is a curved mirror that is concave, or hollow. If one edge of a concave mirror is closer to the center of the curve, the mirror is a 'concave aspheric.' A concave aspheric mirror is more expensive to produce than a simple concave mirror, but it can correct more distortions.\nWhen light reflects off a concave mirror, it will pass through the focal point. The distance from the mirror to the focal point is called the focal length. If the object is placed at a distance from the mirror that is equal to the focal length, the light from the object will come together at the focal point. At this point, the rays of light will appear to come from the same spot.\nSOLUTION: The concavity of the mirror allows you to see its focal point from behind it. The focal point is the point where the mirror refracts, or changes, the path of the light.\nWhen the object is far away from the mirror, the image is formed at the far edge of the mirror's focal point. As the object is moved towards the mirror, the image will move towards the mirror. As the object reaches the focal point, the image will appear at the focal point. As the object is moved towards the focal point, the image will get taller."}

Angular acceleration is described in terms of radians per second squared.\nAngular velocity is a measure of how fast an object is rotating. One radian is a unit of angular measurement. One radian is equivalent to 57.3 degrees.\nIf an object's angular velocity is increasing, its angular acceleration is also increasing. So, the object is spinning or rotating faster.\nIf an object's angular velocity is decreasing, its angular acceleration is also decreasing. So, the object is spinning or rotating slower.\nSOLUTION: The disk rotates for 4.0 s, and during that time, the disk's angular acceleration is 2.0 rad/s^2. So, the disk's angular velocity increases by 2.0 rad/s in 4.0 s.\nThe increase in angular velocity is equal to the angular acceleration, which is 2.0 rad/s^2. So, the disk's angular velocity is 2.0 rad/s higher than it was initially.\nThe distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk is equal to the distance equal to the disk's radius multiplied by the increase in the disk's angular velocity. The distance increased by 2.0 rad/s multiplied by the disk's radius of 0.1 m. So, the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk is 0.2 m."}

An ideal gas can be compressed, condensed, or expanded to any size. An ideal gas cannot be stored in a container of a fixed volume.\nAn ideal gas is a substance that does not have a density. An ideal gas has a density of zero.\nSOLUTION: In an isochoric process, the volume of an ideal gas increases. But the volume of the container does not change.

The wave is allowed to travel from one end of the string to the other. The wave creates a standing wave by moving back and forth between its reflection points. The distance between the reflection points is one-half the wavelength of the wave. So, the string length is a multiple of one-half the wavelength of the wave.\nThe wave speed on the string is fixed.

The electric field due to a charge distribution depends on the distribution of the charge.\nThink about a positive charge at the center of a sphere. The region around the positive charge will have a higher electric field than the region farther away from the center. The electric field will also be zero at a distance from the center equal to the radius of the sphere.\nIf the positive charge is at the center of the sphere, the electric field due to the charge distribution will increase as the radius of the sphere decreases. The electric field will decrease as the radius of the sphere increases.\nSOLUTION: The electric field strength due to the charge distribution at a distance r from the center decreases linearly for r > R.\nThe volume charge density \u03c1 is a function of r only.
