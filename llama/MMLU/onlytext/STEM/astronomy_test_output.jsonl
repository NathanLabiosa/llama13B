For a constant-mass object, the total energy is directly proportional to the square of its speed. For a variable-mass object, the total energy is proportional to the mass and speed.\nSo, for an object with mass m and speed v, its total energy is given by:\nTotal energy = 0.5 \u00d7 m \u00d7 v^2.\nThis is the same as the formula for the kinetic energy of an object of mass m:\nKinetic energy = 0.5 \u00d7 m \u00d7 v^2.\nThe impact of a comet on the earth releases energy from the comet's mass and speed. The comet's mass is m, and its speed is v. The total energy released in the impact is:\nTotal energy = 0.5 \u00d7 m \u00d7 v^2.\nSOLUTION: The minimum impact speed of the comet is v.

When the sun's ultraviolet light strikes the atmosphere, the ultraviolet light breaks the molecules in the atmosphere into ions. The ions are atoms that have gained or lost electrons.\nThe ions can be spread apart by the magnetic field that is caused by the Earth's core.

When a star is formed, the ball of gas and dust that makes up the star is so huge that the star itself is just a small part of the ball. In the ball of gas and dust, atoms are formed by the process of nuclear fusion. This is the process that happens at the heart of a star.\nIn nuclear fusion, atoms combine to form heavier atoms. When an atom is formed, it releases energy. This energy propels some of the atom's lighter particles, or atoms, into space.\nThe particles that are released by nuclear fusion carry with them a small portion of the star's total mass. But because they are expelled from the star at such high speeds, they can travel great distances through the galaxy.\nSo, the atoms that make up the solar system were not formed in the sun. They were formed in other stars and expelled by the process of nuclear fusion. Then, these atoms were brought together to form the sun, the planets, and other objects in the solar system.\nSOLUTION: Hydrogen is the second most common element in the solar system. Hydrogen was formed in other stars and expelled by the process of nuclear fusion. Then, hydrogen was brought together to form the sun, the planets, and other objects in the solar system.\nIron is the fourth most common element in the solar system."}

The inclination affects where the moon is in relation to the Sun and the planet.\nFor a moon to be in resonance, the orbital periods of the moon and the planet must satisfy a simple integer ratio. For example, if a moon takes 2 orbits to go around the planet, then the moon is in a 2:1 resonance. If a moon takes 4 orbits to go around the planet, then the moon is in a 4:1 resonance.\nSOLUTION: The Jupiter's moons system has a 1:2:4 resonance. This means that the moon Io takes 1, 2, or 4 orbits to go around Jupiter. Because the other moons do not have this integer ratio with Jupiter's orbit, they do not share Io's orbit."}

This cloud was also the source of the solar system. As the cloud collapsed, it began to spin faster.\nCentrifugal forces cause objects to move away from the center of a spinning object. So, as the solar nebula spun, the lighter materials were flung away from the center of the cloud. The materials that were heavier sank to the center.\nThis process is called segregation. Over time, the center of the solar nebula became the location for the formation of the inner planets.\nThe inner planets are made of denser materials because they are made of materials that were heavier and sank to the center of the solar nebula."}

When sunlight hits Earth, some of the energy from the light is absorbed by the planet's surface. The absorbed energy heats the surface. As the surface and the atmosphere near the surface get warm, they re-emit the energy they have absorbed. Some of the re-emitted energy is in the form of infrared light.\nGreenhouse gases are molecules that are released into the atmosphere when people burn fossil fuels.

This diagram shows how the solar nebula changed as it cooled and shrunk.\nThe solar nebula started as a hot, dense cloud of gas and dust. As it cooled, the cloud began to shrink. As it did, its gravitational potential energy was converted into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy heated the gas in the nebula.\nThe solar nebula was also surrounded by a layer of cold gas. As the solar nebula shrank, its outer layers cooled and settled onto the surface of the growing Sun. This layer is now the Sun's outer layer, the photosphere."}

Because each atom absorbs the same amount of light, the light that emerges looks darker and hotter than the original light. This phenomenon is called absorption.\nThe absorption lines in the spectrum of the star will appear darker than the rest of the spectrum.\nWhen hydrogen atoms are excited, they can move to a higher energy level. When an atom moves to a higher energy level, it emits light. This light is called an emission line. The emission lines in the spectrum of the hydrogen gas will appear brighter than the rest of the spectrum.\nThe emission lines in the spectrum of the star will appear brighter than the rest of the star's spectrum.\nSOLUTION: The star's light has passed through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas.

If the Sun became 25 times brighter, the amount of solar energy that reached Earth would increase. However, the amount of solar energy that reaches Earth is not equal to the total solar energy produced by the Sun. Some of the solar energy is absorbed by the atmosphere, and the rest reaches the ground.\nSo, the total solar flux (the amount of solar energy per unit area that reaches the ground) on Earth is not 1380 W/m2. It is actually 1380 W/m2 per unit area of the Earth. To receive the same amount of solar flux that we currently receive on Earth, Jupiter would have to be within 5 AU of the Sun.\nSOLUTION: To receive the same solar flux that we currently receive on Earth, Jupiter would have to be within 5 AU of the Sun.

And a black hole can get smaller if it throws out matter.\nSOLUTION: A black hole can get smaller when it emits radiation. One type of radiation a black hole can emit is called Hawking radiation. This radiation is caused by particles that are inside the black hole. These particles can turn into particles of light. When a particle of light is created, it takes some of the black hole's energy with it. This process can happen over and over. So, a black hole can lose mass and get smaller."}

The layer that is closest to Earth is the troposphere. The stratosphere is above the troposphere.\nThe temperature of the atmosphere increases as height above Earth increases. This happens because the air in the lower atmosphere is heated by the surface of Earth.\nThe stratosphere is warm because it is exposed to sunlight. The ozone layer is in the stratosphere. The ozone layer helps to heal the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation.\nSOLUTION: The first answer choice is the best answer. Human activities that are increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are causing Earth to warm.\nGreenhouse gases are formed when you burn fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas. When you drive a car, burn wood, or use electricity made from fossil fuels, you are using fossil fuels.\nGreenhouse gases get into the atmosphere through human activities. Once they are in the atmosphere, they form a layer that keeps Earth's temperature from falling. This layer is called the greenhouse effect.\nThe other answer choices are not correct.\nCFCs were first made in the 1930 s. Since the 1980 s, scientists have found that CFCs contain chemicals that can break down the ozone layer.\nForest fires can release greenhouse gases and other chemicals into the atmosphere. But forest fires cannot be the cause of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nThe increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by human activities."}

For example, larger planets have more mass, which can generate more heat. This heat can cause a planet to be more volcanically active and tectonically active.\nThe presence of an atmosphere: A planet's atmosphere can affect its history of volcanism and tectonism. For example, the atmosphere can affect the amount of heat that a planet absorbs from its star. This heat can cause a planet to be more volcanically active and tectonically active.\nThe distance from the sun: A planet's distance from its star can affect its temperature. The temperature of a planet affects its history of volcanism and tectonism. For example, a planet that is farther from its star is cooler. A cooler planet is less volcanically active and tectonically active.\nThe rotation period: A planet's rotation period can affect the amount of heat it generates. For example, a planet with a shorter rotation period rotates faster. A planet that rotates faster cools down more quickly. A planet that cools down more quickly is less volcanically active and tectonically active.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D. The rotation period of a planet affects the amount of heat it generates. A planet that rotates slower has more time to cool down. So, a planet with a longer rotation period is less volcanically active and tectonically active."}

When a planet's atmosphere traps some of the sun's energy, the planet heats up. This process is called the greenhouse effect.\nThe greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are molecules in the atmosphere that can trap heat. Some greenhouse gases, such as water vapor, are also important in Earth's atmosphere. Other greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are created by human activities.\nThe diagram below shows how the greenhouse effect works. The sun's energy reaches Earth. Some of this energy is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases then release the energy, warming the air around them.\nThe greenhouse effect helps keep Earth warm. But too much greenhouse gas in the atmosphere can cause problems. These problems are called global climate change."}

When the Sun's rays reach Earth, they bounce back as heat into the atmosphere. This is called reflectivity. Some of the energy from the Sun's rays is also absorbed by Earth's surface. The surface of the planet is made of many different materials, such as rocks, soil, and water. Each material absorbs a different amount of energy.\nWhen the atmosphere absorbs the energy from the Sun's rays, it heats up. The atmosphere contains greenhouse gases. These gases make the atmosphere more efficient at trapping heat. The greenhouse gases can absorb some of the energy that was absorbed by Earth's surface. This energy is then re-emitted, or sent back out into the atmosphere. The energy that is re-emitted is in the direction of Earth's surface. So, the surface is heated by the atmosphere.\nThe greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases. These gases are released by natural processes, such as the decay of dead organisms. The largest natural source of greenhouse gases is the oceans.\nHumans have also released a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Some greenhouse gases are released by cars and factories. Burning fossil fuels, such as gasoline and natural gas, releases carbon dioxide. Deforestation, which is the removal of large areas of trees, also releases carbon dioxide.\nThe greenhouse effect is important because it keeps Earth's temperature within a range that is livable for its inhabitants. But too much greenhouse effect can cause problems. As more greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, the temperature of the atmosphere is going up. Scientists believe that the temperature of the atmosphere will keep going up for a long time. This is called global warming.\nGlobal warming can cause problems. Rising temperatures can melt glaciers and cause sea levels to rise. Glaciers are large masses of ice. They are all over the world, but they are especially in the Arctic and Antarctic. As glaciers melt, sea levels will rise. This will flood coastal areas."}

Both Earth and other planets have atmospheres.\nAn atmosphere can keep a planet warm in two ways. The first way is by trapping heat from the sun. This is called the greenhouse effect. Gases in the atmosphere can trap heat from the sun. When the sun's light reaches Earth, some of the light hits the atmosphere. The atmosphere traps some of this light, or radiation, and keeps it from reaching the ground. This heats the ground.\nThe second way an atmosphere can keep a planet warm is by keeping the planet's own heat from escaping. Earth is still heated by the sun even when its surface is dark. This heat travels from the surface to the atmosphere. If the atmosphere is thick, it can hold onto this heat for a long time.\nSOLUTION: Mars does not have a strong greenhouse effect. The atmosphere on Mars is thin. A thin atmosphere does not trap as much heat as a thick atmosphere. Mars is also farther from the sun than Earth is. So, Mars gets much less heat from the sun."}

Remote sensing involves sensing an object or an atmosphere by using a device that is not in contact with it. For example, astronomers use remote sensing to study Jupiter's atmosphere by bouncing radio waves off of the atmosphere. They can learn a lot about an atmosphere by studying the way it interacts with electromagnetic radiation.\nLaboratory experiments can help astronomers understand the chemical and physical processes that occur in atmospheres. For example, experiments can show how molecules interact with electromagnetic radiation.\nSOLUTION: Jupiter is probably not heated by exothermic chemical reactions, internal friction due to its rotation, or contraction. These processes would not generate enough heat to account for the amount of heat that Jupiter radiates.\nJupiter may generate heat through nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is the process by which atoms combine to form a different atom. This process releases a large amount of energy. Jupiter is massive enough to fuse hydrogen atoms in its core."}
