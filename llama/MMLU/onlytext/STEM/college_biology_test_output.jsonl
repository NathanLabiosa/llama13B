These divisions are called cleavage divisions.\nWhen cells divide and group themselves in an identical way, they have cleavage symmetry. Cleavage symmetry can be either meroblastic or radial.\nMeroblastic cleavage symmetry occurs when cells divide so that each resulting cell has an identical view of the animal's surface.

Many proteins are membrane localized, as this allows them to interact with other cellular components or with the environment outside the cell.\nMembrane localization involves the addition of a signal sequence to the protein. The signal sequence is a small peptide that is targeted to the target destination. The target sequence contains a recognition site for the receptor that will eventually recognize and bind to the signal sequence. Once the receptor binds to the signal sequence, the protein is targeted to the destination.\nSome proteins are not membrane localized. These proteins are found in the cytosol, or the area inside the cell. The cytosol is a fluid environment that surrounds the cellular organelles.\nAlthough the cytosol is found inside the cell, it is not a part of any cellular organelles. Some proteins, such as enzymes, are found in the cytosol because they need to be close to their substrates. Other proteins are in the cytosol because they are waiting to be transported to another part of the cell.\nMany cells have a vacuole, which is a cellular organelle that stores waste products and other substances.

The A horizon is below the O horizon. The A horizon is formed from soil that does not have organic matter. The A horizon is usually rich in minerals.\nSOLUTION: Taiga has the highest rate of leaching and cycling of nutrients.\nTaiga has long, cold winters and short, cool summers. In taiga soil, water from rain and snow seeps into the ground. This water picks up nutrients from the soil and carries them into the ground. When the water seeps into the ground, it leaches the nutrients.\nThe soil in taiga has many layers. This layered soil is formed because of the cold temperatures. The layers do not mix.

{"question": "According to Hamilton\u2019s rule, an altruistic trait can evolve if c < br, where c is the fitness cost of the altruistic behavior to the donor, b is the fitness benefit to the recipient, and r is the", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "coefficient of relatedness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "frequency of the altruistic allele"}, {"label": "C", "text": "inbreeding coefficient"}, {"label": "D", "text": "rate of reciprocity"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In any population, organisms interact with each other. Some of these interactions are altruistic, meaning that one organism sacrifices something for the benefit of another. Altruistic behaviors are common, but they can be difficult to explain. For example, if an organism sacrifices its life for a genetically unrelated organism, how could that behavior ever evolve?\nOne possible answer is that altruistic behaviors can evolve if they promote the survival of an organism's genes. For example, helping to take care of your sisters' offspring can increase your inclusive fitness. Your inclusive fitness is your reproductive success, as measured by the number of your offspring. By helping to raise your sisters' young, you increase the number of your nieces and nephews. They are your genetic offspring, so their survival and reproduction increase your inclusive fitness.\nThis idea is called Hamilton's rule, and it can be expressed as:\nc < br,\nwhere c is the cost of the altruistic behavior to the donor, b is the benefit to the recipient, and r is the coefficient of relatedness. The coefficient of relatedness is a measure of how closely organisms are related. It is a value between 0 and 1.\nAltruistic behaviors can evolve if the benefit to the recipient is greater than or equal to the cost to the donor, multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness. This rule uses a mathematical equation to describe the relationship between c, b, and r.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether an altruistic trait can evolve, look at the fitness cost c, the fitness benefit b, and the coefficient of relatedness r.\nIf c < br, the altruistic trait can evolve. The altruistic behavior increases the fitness of the recipient by more than the cost to the donor.\nFor example, consider an organism that is related to its siblings. The coefficient of relatedness between siblings is 1/2.\nIf the fitness cost c of an altruistic behavior is less than 1/2, the behavior can evolve. The benefit to the sibling is greater than or equal to the cost to the organism.\nIf c > br, the altruistic trait cannot evolve. The fitness cost c of the altruistic behavior is greater than the benefit to the recipient.\nFor example, consider an organism that is not related to its siblings.

These proteins make up the thick and thin filaments in the muscle cell.\nThe myosin filaments have a pointed end and a blunt end. The pointed end has a region that can bind to actin. The blunt end contains a site that can bind to ATP, the energy molecule that powers many cellular processes.\nThe actin filaments are thick and thin. The thin actin filaments are in contact with the myosin filaments.\nThese structures are called sarcomeres. The sarcomeres are formed by the actin and myosin filaments. Muscle cells have many sarcomeres.\nDuring a muscle contraction, the myosin filaments form cross-bridges with the thin actin filaments. This connection is formed by the binding of the myosin's ATP-hydrolyzing site to the actin's binding site. When ATP is used up, the myosin's blunt end detaches from the actin filament. This detachment causes the muscle to relax.\nSOLUTION: This statement is incorrect. While it is true that the H zones become elongated during a muscle contraction, this does not occur in the sarcomere. The H zones are the regions of the myosin filament that contain the myosin heads. The myosin heads are the parts of the myosin molecule that bind to actin.\nDuring a muscle contraction, the myosin heads detach from the actin filaments and move. This makes the actin and myosin filaments shorten on opposite sides of the sarcomere. This shortening of the actin and myosin filaments is what causes the muscle to contract."}

Neurons have three main parts: the cell body, dendrites, and an axon.\nThe cell body of a neuron contains the cell's genetic material. Neurons can have many dendrites, which receive signals from other neurons. The axon transmits signals to other neurons.\nAxons can be up to a meter long. To transmit signals so far, axons use a system of branches called terminals. Terminal branches emit neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that transmit signals across the gap between axons and dendrites.\nWhen a neuron is developing, the growth cone is a part of the axon that acts like a cell body for the growing axon. New axons grow out of the growth cone.\nThe correct answer is A. Cytochalasin B is a chemical that prevents actin filaments from depolymerizing. Actin filaments are a type of microfilament."}

Some species can travel great distances to find new homes. For example, many bird species can travel long distances to find food.\nHow well a species can survive in a new home is its ecological dispersal ability. Some species can adapt to many different types of environments. For example, people have traveled to many different types of environments and spread throughout the world.\nSOLUTION: A species with a high K-selected reproductive rate can be more cosmopolitan in distribution. K-selected species have few offspring, but they invest a lot of time and resources in raising each offspring. This strategy works well in stable, unchanging environments. But it does not work as well in unstable, changing environments.\nSOLUTION: A species with a capacity for long-distance dispersal is more likely to become cosmopolitan in distribution. Many bird species are able to travel long distances to find food or new homes.\nA species with limited dispersal abilities is less likely to become cosmopolitan in distribution. Limited dispersal abilities make it harder for a species to spread throughout a large area.\nA species with extreme habitat specialization is less likely to become cosmopolitan in distribution. A species that is very specialized may be able to survive only in a specific type of environment."}

In terms of pressures within the venous and arterial compartments, this transfer results in an increase in venous pressure and an equal but opposite decrease in arterial pressure.\nThe ventricles contract to expel blood into the arteries. This action decreases the volume of blood in the ventricles, lowering the pressure within them. At the same time, the ventricles are pushing blood into the arteries, which are rigid and do not expand. The increase in venous pressure comes from the fact that the heart is pumping blood into the veins more quickly than the veins can fill. As a result, the pressure within the veins rises.\nThe arteries have a smaller inner diameter than the ventricles, so the decrease in arterial pressure is greater than the increase in venous pressure. This pressure change during the cardiac cycle is called the pulse pressure.\nSOLUTION: This transfer of blood from the venous side to the arterial side happens during the mammalian cardiac cycle. So, there is an increase in venous pressure and an equal but opposite decrease in arterial pressure."}

For example, the Golgi apparatus can package proteins and lipids that it has synthesized and ship them to the cell membrane, where they can be transported to other cells. The Golgi apparatus can also receive molecules from the cell membrane and sort them into storage vesicles. These vesicles can then be transported to other parts of the cell.\nAn important function of the Golgi apparatus is to modify proteins and lipids. The Golgi apparatus can add a sugar group to proteins, a process called glycosylation. This process can affect how proteins interact with other cells.\nThe Golgi apparatus can also modify lipids.

Inherited and learned behaviors are gained in different ways.\nInherited behaviors are passed down through families. Offspring gain these behaviors from their parents. Inherited behaviors do not need to be learned.\nLearned behaviors are gained during a person's life. Some learned behaviors, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other learned behaviors, such as playing a musical instrument, are gained by learning to use tools.\nFixed action patterns are a kind of learned behavior. Fixed action patterns are behaviors that are put into motion by a particular situation. Some fixed action patterns are instinctive, which means they do not need to be learned. Other fixed action patterns are gained during a person's life. Birds and mammals often have fixed action patterns.\nConditioned behaviors are gained by learning. Animals learn conditioned behaviors by interacting with their environment. Some conditioned behaviors, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other conditioned behaviors, such as pushing a button to get a treat, are gained by associating an action with a reward.\nSOLUTION: The crouching of very young birds in response to a predator\u2019s shape overhead is an example of a fixed action pattern. Fixed action patterns are behaviors that are put into motion by a particular situation. This response is gained by learning. But it is not learned in the usual way. Birds do not need to learn to crouch in response to a predator."}

During photosynthesis, plants use the energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen.\nPhotosynthesis occurs within the cells of the plant's tissues. The cells of different tissues in a plant are not all the same. For example, the cells in the cortex are different from the cells in the palisade mesophyll. These differences affect the tissues' functions, including their production of oxygen.\nSOLUTION: The palisade mesophyll has the highest rate of oxygen production. The palisade mesophyll is the layer of cells in a plant's leaf underneath the epidermis and above the bundle sheath. During photosynthesis, the cells in the palisade mesophyll produce oxygen gas as a waste product."}
{"question": "A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack.

When water moves through a membrane, it carries solutes with it. If the solute concentration on one side of the membrane is higher than on the other side, water will move through the membrane until the solute concentrations are equal on both sides. This movement of water is called osmosis.\nSOLUTION: The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents. This is what would happen if the interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment."}

Chromosomes contain the genes that are inherited. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism.\nAn organism's chromosomes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. An organism's genes affect which traits it has.\nSOLUTION: An organism's chromosomes determine its genes. An organism's genes determine its observable traits.\nAn organism with two sets of chromosomes has two copies of each gene. Offspring receive their chromosomes, and therefore gain their genes, from their parents.\nAn organism with a double set of chromosomes has two copies of each gene. An organism with extra chromosomes has more than two copies of some genes.\nAn organism with an extra copy of a chromosome may have a version of a gene called an allele. An organism may have one or two alleles for each gene.\nSome alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of an allele to have different effects on an organism's trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers.\nAn organism with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the gene. An organism with at least one f allele will have the f allele's version of the gene.\nSo, a pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele for the flower color gene. This plant will have purple flowers.\nA pea plant with at least one f allele will have the f allele for the flower color gene. This plant will have white flowers.\nAn organism with two alleles of the same type for a gene is homozygous for that allele. A pea plant with two F alleles is homozygous for the F allele. A pea plant with two f alleles is homozygous for the f allele.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with one F allele and one f allele is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nSome alleles, called dominant alleles, have types that can cause their versions of the gene to appear as if the organism has more than two alleles. In pea plants, the F allele is dominant over the f allele. This means that a pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the gene. The F allele is represented by an uppercase letter.\nSo, a pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the gene, which will cause the plant to have purple flowers. The plant will not have the f allele's version of the gene.\nOther alleles, called recessive alleles, have types that can cause their versions of the gene to appear as if the organism has only two alleles. In pea plants, the f allele is recessive to the F allele. This means that a pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the gene. The f allele is represented by a lowercase letter.\nSo, a pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the gene, which will cause the plant to have white flowers. The plant will not have the F allele's version of the gene.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSOLUTION: The plant with the double chromosome number would have genes with two copies. The plant would have alleles of the double chromosome number for each gene.\nThe descendants of the plant with the double chromosome number would have genes with two copies of each allele."}
{"question": "Phalloidin is a toxin made by the death cap mushroom. The toxin binds to actin subunits and disrupts actin function.

The cytoskeleton is made up of three main parts: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.\nMicrofilaments are made of actin, a protein that can pull on other proteins. Many cells have more actin than any other protein in the cytoskeleton. Actin and myosin, another protein, can link together to form a muscle-like network that can pull on other structures within the cell.\nIntermediate filaments are made of intermediate filament proteins. Intermediate filaments can be found in the cytoplasm of most cells.\nMicrotubules are made of tubulin, a protein that can form a hard, hollow tube. Microtubules can help keep a cell's contents in the right place within the cell.\nSOLUTION: Phalloidin binds to actin, so it can disrupt actin function. One way phalloidin does this is by preventing actin from linking to other proteins. This makes the actin less able to do its work in the microfilaments."}

{"question": "Which of the following is encoded by the src oncogene and catalyzes the specific addition of phosphate groups to cellular proteins?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Protein phosphatase"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Adenylate cyclase"}, {"label": "C", "text": "G protein-linked receptor"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tyrosine kinase"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Oncogenes are normal genes that have changed, or mutated, to become cancer-causing genes. One oncogene is the src oncogene. When the src oncogene is present in a cell, it can cause the cell to grow and divide uncontrollably, which can lead to cancer.\nThe src oncogene encodes a protein called a tyrosine kinase. This protein is made in the cytoplasm of the cell and can be turned on when the cell receives a signal to divide. When the src tyrosine kinase is turned on, it adds a phosphate group to an important protein in the cell called a growth factor receptor. This added phosphate group tells the receptor to send a signal to the cell to grow and divide.\nSOLUTION: A protein phosphatase is a type of enzyme that removes phosphate groups from cellular proteins. It does this by adding a phosphate group to a different protein, called a phosphate acceptor. This process is the opposite of the process catalyzed by a protein kinase, which adds a phosphate group to a phosphate acceptor.\nAn adenylate cyclase is an enzyme that makes a molecule called cyclic AMP from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process does not involve the addition of a phosphate group to a protein.\nA G protein-linked receptor is a protein that is activated by a signaling molecule called a neurotransmitter. When the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, it changes the receptor's shape. This changed shape tells a protein called a G protein to turn on a signaling pathway within the cell. This signaling pathway can, in turn, affect gene expression within the cell. But this process does not involve the specific addition of phosphate groups to proteins."}

DNA is organized into genes, or packets of information.\nHow are chromosomes copied?\nBefore a cell divides, it makes a copy of each chromosome. The two copies are passed on to the two daughter cells that are formed during cell division.\nChromosomes are copied during a process called DNA replication. DNA replication is like making a copy of a document. The copy process is shown in the diagram below.\nTwo replication forks, or copies, move in opposite directions along the DNA molecule. As each replication fork moves, it makes a new strand of DNA.\nThe new strands are created on both the original DNA molecule and a new, temporary DNA molecule.\nWhen the replication forks have copied the entire DNA molecule, the two new strands are separated.

The following are some of the ways that human activities are contributing to climate change:\nThe burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\nThe clearing of land for agriculture and other purposes has reduced the number of trees and plants that absorb carbon dioxide.\nThe production of materials such as cement and metal absorbs large amounts of energy, and the manufacturing of these products produces carbon dioxide.\nAnimal agriculture, such as the raising of cows and chickens, produces large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\nSOLUTION: The oak tree gets its mass from the organic matter that is in its parts.

For evolution to occur, certain conditions must be met.\nThere must be a change in the frequencies of alleles in a population's gene pool. This can happen when an organism has offspring. Offspring receive their alleles, or pieces of hereditary material, from their parents. An organism's alleles affect its observable traits, including its appearance and which diseases it may have.\nThe change in allele frequencies can happen by chance. For example, an organism's alleles may cause a trait that is harmful in the current environment. An organism with harmful alleles may have fewer offspring than an organism with more helpful alleles. Over many generations, the harmful alleles will make up a smaller and smaller part of the population's gene pool. This is an example of a change in allele frequencies.\nSelection can also cause a change in allele frequencies. Selection is the process by which some alleles are favored over other alleles. This can happen when an organism with helpful alleles has a better chance of surviving and having offspring."}

A catalyst is a substance that causes a chemical reaction to occur faster.\nAn enzyme increases the rate of a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to start. The activation energy is the energy that must be supplied to the reactants before the chemical reaction can begin.\nEnzymes are specific. An enzyme will catalyze a specific reaction. For an enzyme to catalyze a reaction, the reactant must be able to approach the enzyme's active site. The enzyme's active site is the region of the enzyme that interacts with the reactant.\nSOLUTION: At the maximal rate of reaction, the enzyme is no longer specific for acetaldehyde. This is because the enzyme has interacted with acetaldehyde molecules. These interactions have lowered the activation energy required for the reaction to occur.

An organism's DNA affects its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. DNA is made of two long strands that coil together to form a double helix. The long strands are made of nucleotides, which are organic molecules that contain a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen-containing base.\nThe nitrogen-containing bases in DNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. In each nucleotide, the nitrogen-containing base is bonded to the sugar and phosphate group. Adenine and guanine are complementary, as are cytosine and thymine. This means that adenine can bond with thymine, and guanine can bond with cytosine.\nThis form of bonding is called base pairing. The lines in the diagram below show how the nitrogen-containing bases in one strand of DNA bond with the nitrogen-containing bases in the other strand of DNA.\nThe sequence of nucleotides in a strand of DNA determines the strand's genotype. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of nucleotides for that gene.\nAn organism's observable trait for a gene, which depends on the organism's combination of nucleotides, is its phenotype for that gene.\nSome nucleotides in a strand of DNA can have different forms, called alleles. An organism's allele for a gene is its choice of nucleotide.\nFor example, the gene for human blood type has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for blood type A, and the allele V is for blood type B.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, an organism can have a genotype of FF, FV, or VV for the blood type gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable combination of alleles for that trait. An organism with the genotype FF or VV for the blood type gene has the phenotype blood type A, and an organism with the genotype FV has the phenotype blood type B.\nSOLUTION: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of nucleotides for that gene. A mutation in a gene occurs when a nucleotide in the gene changes.\nMutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype in several ways. For example, a change in a crucial nucleotide in a gene may change the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide that is produced from the gene. The polypeptide is the large molecule made up of amino acids that a gene encodes. The polypeptide may have a different function or interact with different partners in the organism, which can result in a new trait.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable combination of alleles for that trait. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.\nIf an organism has at least one allele for a gene, that allele is called a dominant allele. If an organism does not have any alleles for a gene, or if the organism's alleles for the gene are all recessive, then any one of the organism's alleles is called a recessive allele.\nSome traits, like the flower color trait in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two dominant alleles for a gene is homozygous for the gene. A pea plant with the F allele is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two recessive alleles for a gene is homozygous for the gene. A pea plant with the ff allele is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with one dominant allele and one recessive allele for a gene is heterozygous for the gene. A pea plant with the Ff allele is heterozygous for"}

A noncompetitive inhibitor is a molecule that does not bind to the enzyme's binding site. Instead, the inhibitor and substrate bind to different places on the enzyme or on the substrate.\nSOLUTION: A competitive inhibitor of an enzyme exerts its effect by irreversibly modifying some of the amino acid residues that help to comprise the enzyme's active site.\nThe enzyme's active site is the part of the enzyme that binds to the substrate. The active site contains amino acid residues that are involved in the catalysis of the chemical reaction.\nWhen a competitive inhibitor binds to the enzyme's active site, it prevents the enzyme from functioning.

The graph includes two possible ranges of stimulus intensity. The activity below each range shows the firing rate of neurons in response to stimuli of different intensities.\nIn the top range, the stimulus intensity is high enough that the neuron fires an action potential. But in the bottom range, the stimulus intensity is too low to cause the neuron to fire an action potential.\nThe firing rate of a neuron is determined by the number of action potentials that the neuron produces.

Respiration occurs when plants use organic matter to produce carbon dioxide and other compounds.\nNPP is high when photosynthesis is limited by water, nutrients, or light. NPP is low when respiration is high.\nSOLUTION: The best explanation for why net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics is the availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics.\nIn the tropics, there is more sunlight and warmth, which means that plants can photosynthesize more. Tropical ecosystems also receive more rain, or precipitation. Rain replenishes the soil with water, which plants need to survive."}

Osmosis is a special type of diffusion, or movement, that happens without help from the plant.\nThe surface of the root is covered with small holes, called openings. Water moves through these openings into the root.\nAs the water moves into the root, it leaves behind a higher concentration of water outside the root. This higher concentration of water outside the root is what makes water move into the root in the first place.

Some excretory organs, such as the kidneys, perform other essential functions as well.\nThe nephrons in the kidneys filter the blood and remove excess water and waste products. The filtrate, which is the fluid that collects in the spaces between the blood vessels and the cells in the kidneys, is called urine.\nSOLUTION: The correct statement about excretory organs is that the kidneys of saltwater fishes produce urine hyperosmotic to their tissues.\nAn organism's tissues are made up of cells. The cells in an organism's tissues need water to live. But they cannot have too much water. If they do, their cells may swell up and die.\nA hyperosmotic substance is a substance that has a higher concentration of particles. When the kidneys of saltwater fishes produce urine, the urine has a higher concentration of particles than the water in the fish's tissues. This means that the water in the fish's tissues will leave the tissues and enter the urine.\nThe correct statement is also supported by the diagram of a nephron, which is a small filtering unit in the kidneys. The filtrate flows down the medulla because the medulla is thinner in the center. As the filtrate flows through the medulla, water and other particles leave the filtrate and enter the blood. The blood carries the particles to the bladder, where they are eliminated from the body.\nThe other statements are not true.\nDesert mammals produce urine that is hypoosmotic to the urine of freshwater fishes. A hypotonic substance is a substance that has a lower concentration of particles than another substance. The urine of a desert mammal has a lower concentration of particles than the water in the tissues of a freshwater fish. So, the water in the tissues of a freshwater fish will leave the tissues and be absorbed by the urine.\nMalpighian tubules do not allow insects to excrete waste through the exoskeleton. Insects do not have a medulla in their kidneys. The part of the nephron that is in the medulla is important for producing hyperosmotic urine. Insects do not have a medulla, so they do not have hyperosmotic urine.\nJuxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine. A mammal's kidneys have both juxtamedullary nephrons and collecting ducts. The collecting ducts are part of the nephron that is not in the medulla. The collecting ducts can change the concentration of particles in the filtrate. So, a mammal's kidneys can produce hypotonic or hypertonic urine."}

{"question": "Which of the following is a reason that geneticists use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to study the relatedness of animal populations?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "mtDNA mutates at a slower rate than nuclear DNA."}, {"label": "B", "text": "mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes."}, {"label": "C", "text": "There are few single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hypervariable, noncoding regions."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mitochondrial genes."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Mitochondrial DNA is passed down from mother to child.\nSOLUTION: Mitochondrial DNA is passed down from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes. This means that each offspring receives its mitochondrial DNA solely from its mother. Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a slower rate than nuclear DNA, and there are few single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hypervariable, noncoding regions. These features make mitochondrial DNA a powerful tool for studying the relatedness of animal populations."}

{"question": "A female fruit fly bearing linked genes that produce the phenotype gray body and normal wings mates with a male fruit fly of phenotype black body and vestigial wings. The presence of gray-bodied, vestigialwinged flies among the progeny is best explained by", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "crossing over"}, {"label": "B", "text": "independent assortment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "segregation of alleles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "penetrance"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSOLUTION: The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is best explained by segregation of alleles.\nSegregation of alleles occurs when an organism's alleles for a gene separate during meiosis. Meiosis is the process by which cells divide to form gametes, which are eggs and sperm.\nDuring meiosis, each allele for a gene separates and is passed on to a different gamete. An organism's progeny will have a combination of alleles inherited from each parent.\nFor example, in pea plants, the F and f alleles for the flower color gene separate during meiosis. An egg or sperm cell will have either an F allele or an f allele for the gene.\nWhen a pea plant's gametes fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote will have a combination of alleles inherited from the parents. A zygote with at least one F allele will have the F allele for the gene. A zygote with at least one f allele will have the f allele for the gene.\nSo, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."}
{"question": "Which of the following active pools of carbon is the largest on Earth and contributes the most to carbon cycling?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The atmosphere"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rain-forest vegetation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Recoverable fossil fuels"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The oceans"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Carbon is an element that makes up many different organic compounds. Carbon has the ability to bond with other carbon atoms to form long chains. The type of organic compounds that make up a living thing's body is called its organic matter.\nCarbon cycles are ways in which carbon moves between different parts of an ecosystem.\nOne carbon cycle starts with plants. Plants use carbon from the atmosphere to make their organic matter. Animals, including people, eat the plants. Then, animals and people exhale carbon from the atmosphere. This carbon is used by other plants to make their organic matter.\nAnother carbon cycle starts with fossil fuels. Over millions of years, the remains of plants and animals are broken down and mixed with hydrogen and oxygen from the atmosphere. This process forms a type of fossil fuel called crude oil. Crude oil can be converted into gasoline, diesel fuel, and other products. When these products are burned, the carbon is released into the atmosphere."}

Natural selection occurs when some traits are either favored or unfavored by the environment.\nAn environment includes all of the biotic, or living, and abiotic, or nonliving, things in the area around an organism. Biotic parts of an environment include other organisms. Abiotic parts of an environment include weather, soil, and water.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nDifferential survival and reproductive success are the key aspects of natural selection.\nIndividuals with trait values that are good for their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than individuals with values that are not as good. As a result, the good values will become more common in the population.\nOver several generations, natural selection can cause populations to evolve. Populations become adapted to their environments.\nSOLUTION: Charles Darwin's proposed conditions for natural selection encompass all of the following with regard to a given population EXCEPT the inheritance of both \"fit\" and \"unfit\" genes.\nInheritance of both fit and unfit genes does not provide a population with the genetic material it needs to survive and reproduce. Unfit genes are unfit because they do not help an organism survive or reproduce. Organisms do not have unfit genes for important traits such as survival or reproduction."}

One way that plants conserve water is by recycling water from the leaves to the roots. This recycling is possible because the water travels through tissues called xylem within the plant.\nThe xylem contain two types of cells: tracheary and companion cells. Companion cells store and release substances that help move water through the xylem. In the absence of companion cells, the water moves through the tracheary cells.\nThe xylem also contain a supportive tissue called collenchyma. The collenchyma provides support to the plant, helping to keep the plant upright.\nSOLUTION: The cohesion-tension theory for the ascent of water in the xylem states that water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by all the water above a given point.\nThe cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms (air bubbles) in the water column. When a tree is injured, the cohesion of water molecules pulls the water upward, causing the embolisms to form.\nThe evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column. The tension is created by the surface tension of the water. Surface tension is the tension that acts at the surface of the water.\nLiving cells of the xylem provide the main conduit for an ascent of water. The conduit is formed mainly by the tracheary cells."}

In flowering plants, the phloem is composed of four main components: fibers, phloem parenchyma, companion cells, and sieve tubes.\nThe fibers are strong, flexible cells that help to hold the plant tissue together and provide support.\nThe phloem parenchyma cells are responsible for the synthesis of the sugar that is transported in the phloem.\nThe companion cells regulate the uptake of water and mineral ions from the xylem.\nThe sieve tubes are the conduits through which sugar is transported from the phloem parenchyma to the rest of the plant.\nSOLUTION: The sucrose moves from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem through the symplastic pathway. The symplastic pathway, or symplasmic pathway, is the movement of solutes through the cytoplasm of cells.\nThe sucrose moves through the cytoplasm of the mesophyll cells, into the phloem parenchyma cells, and then into the sieve tubes."}
