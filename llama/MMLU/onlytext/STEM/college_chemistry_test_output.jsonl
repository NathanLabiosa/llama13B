This reaction is called complexation.\nThe formation of the metal complex affects the ratio of EDTA to metal complex in solution. This ratio, called the equilibrium constant, tells you about the relative concentrations of the EDTA ion and the metal complex.\nThe equilibrium constant depends on the conditions of the titration, including the pH. So, the conditional formation constant, Ka, is affected by pH.\nThe fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form also varies with pH. At higher pH values, fewer of the EDTA ions will be in the Y4\u2212 form.\nSOLUTION: The analyte solution and the titrant solution are both buffered at the same pH for three reasons:\nI. The conditional formation constant is affected by pH.\nII. The fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form varies with pH.\nIII. When EDTA reacts to form a metal complex, H+ is a product in most cases."}

The gains and losses change the atoms into ions.\nSome ions are formed when an atom gains electrons. For example, the negatively charged ion is formed when an atom loses electrons.\nThe radius of an ion is a measure of its size. The table below shows how the size of an ion compares to the size of an atom.\n | Atom | Average ion\nRadius | Hydrogen | 0.000001 meters | H+ | 0.000001 meters |\n | Carbon | 0.00001 meters | C+ | 0.000001 meters |\n | SOLUTION: The radius of the Sc3+ ion is smaller than the radius of the Ca2+ ion.\nTo see this, compare the sizes of the ions by looking at the sizes of the atoms that make them up.\nThe Ca2+ ion is formed from the calcium atom. The radius of the calcium atom is 0.00001 meters. So, the radius of the Ca2+ ion is 0.00001 meters.\nThe Sc3+ ion is formed from the scandium atom. The radius of the scandium atom is 0.000001 meters. So, the radius of the Sc3+ ion is smaller than the radius of the Ca2+ ion."}

EPR spectra consist of peaks with various frequencies and intensities. The frequencies determine the spin of the radical and the intensity of a peak is proportional to the number of radicals that are detected.\nAn EPR spectrum has several pieces of information:\nThe number of lines in the spectrum indicates the number of radicals in the sample.\nThe frequencies of the lines show the spin of the radical.\nThe intensity of the lines indicates the number of spins in the radical.\nSo, an EPR spectrum can tell you how many radicals are in a sample and how many spins each radical has.\nSOLUTION: The molecule CH3)2NO is a nitroxide radical. Its EPR spectrum has one line.\nThe spectrum of a solution of a molecule is different from the spectrum of the molecule itself. A solution is made up of many molecules. The lines in an EPR spectrum of a solution can be broader and have lower intensity than the lines in the spectrum of the molecule. This is because molecules in a solution are farther apart and have different surroundings than they do in a solid.\nAssistant: LECTURE: EPR spectra have several pieces of information. The number of lines in the spectrum tells you the number of spins in the radical. The higher the number of lines, the more spins there are.\nThe frequencies of the lines show the spin of the radical. The frequency of a line is a measure of the energy associated with the spin of the radical.\nThe intensity of the lines tells you the intensity of the radiation emitted by the radical. The intensity of a line is a measure of the radiation that is emitted.\nSOLUTION: An EPR spectrum has one line. This line tells you that the nitroxide radical has one spin. The frequency of the line tells you the energy associated with the spin of the radical.\nThe intensity of the line tells you the intensity of the radiation emitted by the radical."}
