Voltage is a measure of electric potential, or the energy needed to move electric charges between two points.\nA galvanometer is an early type of voltmeter that uses a thin wire with a magnetic core. The current in the wire is measured by observing the wire's deflection.\nPotentiometer measurement is a method of determining the voltage in a circuit using a potentiometer. A potentiometer is a device that puts a voltage across a resistor. The voltage measured across the resistor is equal to the voltage of the circuit.\nSOLUTION: The potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it loads the circuit moderately. A voltmeter measures the voltage of a circuit by subtracting the voltage of the reference point from the voltage measured across the circuit. The more of the circuit that is included in the measurement, the higher the measured voltage.\nBy using a potentiometer, the voltage of the circuit is measured by subtracting the voltage of the reference point from the voltage measured across the resistor. The potentiometer method loads the circuit to a maximum extent, but it does not load the circuit to its maximum capacity.\nThe direct measurement method uses a voltmeter to measure the voltage directly across the circuit. The direct measurement method loads the circuit to its maximum capacity."}

The angle counter emf is a measure of the amount of voltage a circuit delivers to a load.\nThe angle counter emf of a circuit is called the firing angle. The firing angle tells you how the voltage delivered to a load changes with time.\nSOLUTION: To find the range of firing angle control, you need to find the time it takes the voltage to rise from 0 to 200 V.\nThe voltage is 400 sin(314 t).\nThe time it takes the voltage to rise from 0 to 200 V is equal to the time it takes the voltage to rise from 0 to 400 V.
