These adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.\nAs offspring inherit their adaptations from their parents, adaptations can change over time. If an adaptation is helpful for an organism to survive and reproduce, it is likely to be passed down through the family.\nIf an adaptation is not helpful, it is likely to be lost.\nHow do new species evolve?\nA new species may evolve when a group of organisms becomes isolated from the rest of the species. If the isolation is complete and the conditions are right, the isolated group may evolve into a new species.\nThis process, called speciation, may occur when a new species evolves.\nSOLUTION: Convergent evolution is when two unrelated species evolve in a similar way.

Water potential is a measurement of the potential energy of water. It tells you how much water is in a plant or an animal.\nA plant's or an animal's water potential can change for many reasons. Some of the reasons are:\nthe temperature of the water or water vapor\nthe concentration of solutes in the water\nthe pressure on the water\nA plant or an animal tries to change its water potential to match its current environment. If the water potential of a plant or an animal changes, the water will move into or out of the plant or animal until the water potential is the same as its environment.\nSOLUTION: The correct statement is that germinating seeds use less oxygen than do nongerminating seeds.\nGerminating seeds have a lower water potential than nongerminating seeds. This is because they take in water, and the water increases the water potential of the seeds. As the water potential of the seeds increases, the oxygen in the seeds is used up. The seeds use oxygen to power the growth of the root."}

He also saw that each type of tortoise was adapted to its own island. For example, some tortoises had thick legs and strong beaks. These traits helped the tortoises climb trees and eat leaves.\nDarwin realized that each type of tortoise was a separate species. He also suspected that they had all started as a single species. Over time, the ancestors of these tortoises may have migrated to different islands. There, they adapted to their new environments.\nDarwin's observations on the Galapagos Islands provided important evidence for the theory of evolution.

T cells and B cells are types of white blood cells.\nWhen a macrophage or dendritic cell detects an antigen, it can activate a nearby B cell. The activated B cell begins to produce antibodies against the antigen. Antibodies are proteins that can recognize specific antigens.\nOnce activated, the B cell becomes a plasma cell.

Genes are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: A Barr body is a type of inactivated X chromosome found in females.\nFemales have two X chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. One X chromosome is active, and the other is inactivated during fetal development. The inactivated X chromosome is called a Barr body.\nThe X chromosome has many genes, some of which are described in the question. One of these genes is the X-linked gene for the production of a protein called HBB.

During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds and oxygen.\nAlthough cyanobacteria produced oxygen during photosynthesis, oxygen did not build up in the atmosphere. Oxygen is a highly reactive element, so it reacts with many other elements to form compounds. For a long time, oxygen reacted with iron in rocks to form iron oxide, or rust. So, there was no net increase in the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere.\nAbout 1.5 billion years ago, cyanobacteria began to convert a different type of atmospheric nitrogen, nitrogen gas, into nitrate. These nitrifying bacteria use an enzyme called nitrate to convert nitrogen gas into nitrite and then into nitrate.\nAutotrophs, which make their own food, had to evolve before oxygen could begin to accumulate in the atmosphere. These organisms produce organic compounds using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight. When they produce organic compounds, oxygen is produced as a byproduct.\nHeterotrophs, which survive by consuming other organisms, had to evolve before the oxygen could build up to its present level.

All organisms are part of one or more species. A species is a group of organisms that can breed and produce offspring. Offspring are the young of organisms.\nSpecies come in many shapes and sizes. The shape of an organism is its phenotype. An organism's genes determine its phenotype. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that are passed from parents to offspring.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. For example, an organism's genes determine its eye color and its blood type.\nEvolution occurs when there are changes in an organism's genes. These changes can make an organism's phenotype better suited to its environment. This can make the organism more likely to survive and reproduce.\nSOLUTION: Evolution is not goal-directed. An organism's genes do not have a \"goal\" or a \"plan\" for the organism to follow.\nEvolution is not synonymous with the process of gene flow. Gene flow is the movement of genes into or out of a population. This movement can occur because of migration or because of the transfer of genes from parents to offspring.\nEvolution is not the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes.

Monosaccharides can be linked together by bonds to form disaccharides or polysaccharides.\nMonosaccharides and disaccharides can be absorbed through the intestines into the bloodstream. But polysaccharides must be broken down before they can be absorbed. This breaking down is called hydrolysis.\nSOLUTION: People can digest starch because the bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose. So, the body is able to break the bonds in starch. But the bonds in cellulose are different. It is difficult to break the bonds in cellulose."}

Some organisms, including people, have changed over time to adapt to their environment. But an organism's abilities do not need to change for it to move to a new place. An organism's offspring can migrate to a new place, and they will inherit their parents' adaptations. Offspring can also spread into new environments by hitchhiking on organisms that are not their parents.\nThis is how new species can form. Over many generations, an organism's offspring may change to adapt to their new environment. These changes can be inherited by the offspring. Over time, the offspring may become a new species."}

Eukaryotic cells are cells that have a true nucleus and other organelles.\nThe cell cycle has three main phases: G_1, S, and G_2.\nBefore a cell enters the cell cycle, it prepares an alterative set of genetic material, called a messenger RNA (mRNA) copy of its genes. This alternative set of genetic material can be used to create proteins to help the cell grow and divide.\nThe G_1 phase is the first phase of the cell cycle. During the G_1 phase, the cell makes an mRNA copy of its genes and prepares for the S phase.\nThe S phase is the DNA synthesis phase. During the S phase, the cell uses the information in the cell's genes to make a new mRNA copy of its genes. This new mRNA copy is needed to make proteins that will help the cell grow and divide.\nThe G_2 phase is the second phase of the cell cycle. During the G_2 phase, the cell makes proteins from the mRNA copy of its genes. These proteins prepare the cell for cell division.\nThe M phase is the mitosis phase. The M phase is also called the cell division phase. During the M phase, the cell divides its cytoplasm and organelles, so that each daughter cell can grow and divide independently.\nSOLUTION: The cell cycle is a repeating process. Every cell goes through the G_1, S, and G_2 phases in a regular sequence. The G_2 phase is the phase that comes after the S phase. So, the quantity of DNA in a eukaryotic cell typically doubles during the S phase."}

An allele is a piece of hereditary material that contains the instructions that affect inherited traits. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of an inherited trait.\nFor example, flower color is an inherited trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for an inherited trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of an inherited trait to appear as the organism's phenotype. For example, the F allele, which is for purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. This means that a pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with FF or Ff alleles will have purple flowers.\nIn pea plants, the F allele is dominant over the f allele. This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nSome alleles have types called co-dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of an inherited trait to appear as the organism's phenotype. For example, the B allele, which is for brown flowers, is co-dominant over the b allele. This means that a pea plant with at least one B allele will have the B allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with BB or Bb alleles will have brown flowers.\nIn pea plants, the B allele is co-dominant over the b allele. This means B is a co-dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.\nSOLUTION: The flower color gene has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers.\nHydrangea flowers have one gene for flower color. Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown.\nThis phenomenon is called incomplete dominance. Incomplete dominance occurs when neither allele is dominant over the other. This means that the two alleles' types are called codominant.\nIn hydrangeas, the F and f alleles are codominant. Each allele contributes to the organism's phenotype. So, a hydrangea plant with at least one F allele and at least one f allele will have a blend of the two alleles' versions of the flower color trait."}

These traits affect their chances of surviving and reproducing.\nTraits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Traits also need to be learned. Learning is the process of gaining new knowledge or skills during a person's life.\nIn order for an organism to survive, its traits must include both adaptations and strategies. Adaptations are body parts or behaviors that have evolved to help an organism survive and reproduce. Animals and plants have many adaptations. Some adaptations, such as eyes, help an organism sense its environment. Other adaptations, such as legs, help an organism move.\nStrategies are plans of action that an organism uses to survive and reproduce. An organism's strategies can include behaviors, such as whether to flee or defend itself when threatened. An organism's strategies can also include choices, such as which foods to eat.\nSOLUTION: When imbalances occur in the sex ratio of sexual species that have two sexes, the members of the minority sex often receive a greater proportion of care and resources from parents than do the offspring of the majority sex. This is most clearly an example of balancing selection.\nBalancing selection is a type of natural selection that occurs when different types of an organism have different strategies or behaviors that can affect how much care and resources they need. If the type of an organism that needs more care and resources is rare, then natural selection will favor the minority type. This is because the minority type will receive more care and resources than the majority type."}

The gene pool is all the genes in a species.\nThe frequency of a gene is important because it affects the likelihood that an organism will have the gene. An organism with one copy of a gene will have one allele, or form, of the gene. An organism with two copies of a gene will have two alleles of the gene.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, an organism's genotype for a gene may be one, two, or zero alleles.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of alleles for that gene, which can include types called dominant and recessive. Some traits, such as flower color in pea plants, have dominant and recessive alleles. Offspring receive their alleles for these traits from their parents. An organism's phenotype for a trait may be one allele or a combination of alleles.\nSOLUTION: The frequency of mutation appears to be low. This means that not many alleles are produced by mutation.\nSome mutations produce alleles that are recessive and may not be expressed. These alleles can still cause problems at the cellular level. But these alleles may not affect an organism's observable traits. So, these alleles may not be included in the organism's phenotype for the gene. As a result, the frequency of the gene may not change.\nSome undesirable phenotypic traits may be prevented from reproducing. This can help keep the frequency of these traits in the gene pool low. But it does not remove the alleles for these traits from the gene pool. So, the frequency of the gene may not change.\nSome mutations cause such drastic phenotypic changes that they are removed from the gene pool. This means that the mutations are not included in the organism's phenotype for the gene. As a result, the frequency of the gene may not change.\nThe predictable rate of mutation results in ongoing variability in a gene pool. This means that the frequency of a gene will change over time. New alleles will be produced by mutation. Other alleles will be removed from the gene pool. But the rate of change will be regular and predictable."}

The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn allele is dominant or recessive. Dominant alleles have types of the trait that are different from the type caused by recessive alleles. For the flower color gene in pea plants, the F allele is dominant for the F type of flower, and the f allele is recessive for the f type of flower.\nIn pea plants, each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of the trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its type of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's type of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its type of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's type of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The allele B is for black fur, and the allele b is for brown fur. The allele E is for yellow fur, and the allele e is for pigmented fur.\nThe allele B is dominant over b, and E is dominant over e. This means B and E are dominant alleles, and b and e are recessive alleles.\nThe genotype BB, Bb, BBb, or Bbe will have only dominant alleles.

These changes can be caused by different factors.\nSOLUTION: Fertilization is the process by which a male gamete, or sperm, fuses with a female gamete, or egg. This process creates a fertilized egg, or zygote.\nDuring meiosis, which occurs before fertilization, each germ cell receives a copy of each parent's chromosomes. These chromosomes include pieces of heritable material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring.\nDuring meiosis, the pieces of heritable material may swap parts with each other.

An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.\nSOLUTION: An organism's nucleotide variability is a measure of the number of different alleles found in the population. This measure is affected by the proportion of fixed alleles in the population.\nA fixed allele is an allele that is only found in the population at a low frequency. These alleles are usually caused by mutations, or changes in the DNA sequence. Over time, low-frequency alleles can be lost or removed from the population by genetic drift or natural selection.\nThe proportion of fixed alleles in a population is equal to the sum of the frequencies of the low-frequency alleles in the population.\nSo, as the number of low-frequency alleles in a population increases, the proportion of fixed alleles in the population increases. This increase reduces the population's nucleotide variability.\nAn organism's average heterozygosity is a measure of the average frequency of different alleles found in the population. This measure is affected by the proportion of fixed alleles in the population.\nAs the number of low-frequency alleles in a population increases, the proportion of fixed alleles in the population increases. This increase reduces the population's average heterozygosity.\nA population's genetic polyploidy does not affect its nucleotide variability or average heterozygosity. Polyploidy is when an organism has more than two sets of chromosomes."}

One of the key roles of the plasma membrane is to control the concentration of substances inside cells.\nThe plasma membrane allows some substances to diffuse across it. This diffusion is called passive transport. Some substances, like oxygen and carbon dioxide, diffuse across the plasma membrane freely. Other substances, like sugar and protein, need to be transported across the plasma membrane.\nDiffusion is a type of movement that happens when two areas have different concentrations of a substance. For diffusion to occur, the concentration of the substance in the area where it is less concentrated must be higher than in the area where it is more concentrated.\nConsider a simple diffusion situation: A vase of flowers is in a room. The flowers give off their scent. The scent spreads throughout the room. The scent diffuses from a higher concentration to a lower concentration. The scent leaves the flowers and mixes with the air in the room.\nSOLUTION: Cells have a concentration gradient for many substances. The concentration of a substance is higher in the cytoplasm of a cell than in the surrounding fluid. This means that the substance diffuses across the plasma membrane from the cytoplasm of the cell to the surrounding fluid.\nThe rate of diffusion is determined by the concentration gradient and the distance between the two areas. The higher the concentration of a substance in one area, the greater the concentration gradient. The greater the distance between the two areas, the farther the substance has to diffuse.\nIncreasing the concentration of a solute in one area and decreasing the concentration in the other area will increase the concentration gradient. This increase in the concentration gradient will increase the rate of diffusion.\nThe membrane potential of a cell is a electrical difference across the plasma membrane. It is not a concentration gradient. The membrane potential does not affect the rate of diffusion.\nThe ratio of phospholipids to proteins in the membrane does not affect the rate of diffusion. The plasma membrane is a very thin layer of material. It is not possible for the membrane to change its ratio of phospholipids to proteins.\nDecreasing the number of different solutes in the solution that bathes the cells will decrease the concentration of each solute in the solution. This decrease in concentration will decrease the concentration gradient for each solute. The decrease in the concentration gradient will decrease the rate of diffusion."}

RNA molecules can be made up of one strand, or they can be made up of two strands that are bonded by a branch.\nThe types of RNA in a cell are:\n1. ribosomal RNA (rRNA): Ribosomes are the cell's protein factories. RRNA provides the structural support for ribosomes.\n2. transfer RNA (tRNA): tRNA molecules move amino acids around the cell. They bring amino acids to ribosomes, where they are added to proteins.\n3. messenger RNA (mRNA): mRNA is a copy of a DNA molecule. After mRNA is made, it carries a copy of the DNA instructions to the ribosomes. The ribosomes use the mRNA instructions to build proteins.\nA DNA segment is made up of a single strand of nucleotides. It is a portion of a DNA molecule.\nA primary RNA transcript is a first copy of a DNA segment. It is made during a process called transcription.\nA complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule is a copy of a single strand of DNA. It is made during a process called cDNA synthesis.\nSOLUTION: A single strand of the original DNA segment contains the fewest number of nucleotides."}

It is now widely accepted, but many people, even some biologists, do not understand how it happens.\nNatural selection is a simple idea. It is the result of two facts:\nAll species have offspring.\nOffspring are similar to their parents.\nThese two facts mean that a species is made up of organisms that are somewhat similar to each other. This means that some organisms will be better adapted to their environment than others.\nBecause the better-adapted organisms will be able to reproduce more successfully, the species will have more offspring of its own. Over many generations, the better-adapted organisms will come to dominate the species.\nSOLUTION: Darwin learned about the idea that populations tend to increase at a faster rate than their food supply normally allows from the writings of Thomas Malthus. This idea gave Darwin an important clue about how natural selection could work."}

They later became chloroplasts, where they gained the ability to carry out photosynthesis.\nThe fluid mosaic model is based on the idea that the cell membrane is a phospholipid layer with proteins scattered throughout. This model proposes that the cell membrane is a fluid layer that is a mixture of phospholipids and proteins. The proteins have important functions in the cell membrane. Some proteins are responsible for transporting molecules across the cell membrane. Other proteins are responsible for receiving signals from the outside world and sending signals to the cell's interior.\nThe taxonomic model is a classification system for organisms.

These alleles can have different forms, or alleles.\nFor some genes, the alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as if they are a single type.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits.

Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as if they are a single type.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The gene for the autosomal recessive trait is ff. The ff allele is for the recessive version of the trait. So, an organism with the ff allele is a carrier of the recessive allele but does not express the recessive allele's version of the trait.\nAn organism with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait.

In humans, the X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X chromosome (X).\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a gene in pea plants. The gene has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Females with Turner's syndrome have a high incidence of hemophilia, a recessive, X-linked trait. This incidence is expected because females with Turner's syndrome are missing part of an X chromosome. Hemophilia is caused by an allele that is located on the X chromosome.\nFemales have two X chromosomes, one inherited from each parent.

The mitochondria produce ATP by burning fuel. Just as a fire needs fuel to burn, mitochondria need a source of fuel to produce ATP.\nFuel is transported into mitochondria and is broken down to release its energy. The energy is used to produce ATP. The fuel is also used to reduce coenzyme A.\nCoenzyme A accepts electrons from the fuel during the breakdown process. As the electrons are transferred to coenzyme A, its oxidation state changes. The change in oxidation state is used to produce ATP.\nWhen the fuel is broken down, the coenzyme A becomes reduced. As the fuel is broken down, its oxidation state changes. The change in oxidation state is called an electron.\nIn order to produce ATP, the electrons must be transported from the fuel to the coenzyme A. This movement of electrons is called electron transfer.\nThis electron transfer is made possible by energy from the mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial membrane is a fatty acid. When hydrogen atoms from the fatty acid are transferred to the electron transfer complex, the complex gains energy.\nThis energy is used to produce ATP.\nWhen the electron transfer complex gains energy, it becomes a higher-energy complex. This higher-energy complex is called an electron transport complex.\nThe electron transport complex uses its energy to produce ATP.

An isolated area is called a population.\nPopulations can be large or small. Large populations are made up of many individuals. These individuals can find partners to breed with easily. This happens when an organism reproduces. When offspring are produced, they inherit their traits, including their genes, from their parents. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits.\nAn isolated population of organisms is called a subpopulation. A subpopulation is a smaller group of individuals within a population. Some subpopulations may be isolated from the rest of the population by physical barriers.\nSOLUTION: A population is endangered when its survival is in danger. Some of the factors that can endanger a population include inbreeding, loss of genetic variation, and migration.\nInbreeding occurs when individuals breed with partners too closely related to them. Inbreeding can lead to offspring with inherited traits that are not as varied as those of offspring produced by breeding with partners from outside the population. This can harm the population's genetic makeup.\nLoss of genetic variation occurs when a population's genetic makeup becomes too similar. This can leave the population vulnerable to conditions that can harm the population.\nMigration of new individuals into the population can bring in new genetic material. This can help maintain a population's genetic makeup.\nBreeding with individuals from a different population may cause the extinction of the first population due to a decrease in diversity. This can happen if the two populations breed to form a single, larger population. The larger population may not have enough genetic variation to survive."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nHereditary material can change, or mutate, spontaneously. These mutations can lead to new traits, including some that may be advantageous. For example, a mutation that causes a plant to grow to a larger size may increase its chances of survival.\nWhen an organism has a trait that is advantageous, it is said to have an advantageous trait. This trait may prove useful under certain environmental conditions. For example, a large plant may be able to outcompete smaller plants for resources, such as water and nutrients, under dry conditions.\nAdvantageous traits are more likely to be passed on to offspring than nonadvantageous traits. This is because offspring will have the advantageous traits of their parents. Offspring will then have an increased chance of survival and reproduction.\nOver many generations, advantageous traits can become more common in a population. This is called directional selection.\nPopulations of organisms are adapted to their environments. An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive and reproduce in its environment.\nAn adaptation may be related to an organism's behavior, its anatomy, or which diseases it may have. For example, feathers are an adaptation that help birds survive and reproduce in their environment.\nSOLUTION: Horses have changed in size over time. This is called directional selection.

Mitochondria have a double membrane: an outer membrane and an inner membrane. The inner membrane is folded to form cristae, which increase the surface area available for ATP synthesis. The cristae are surrounded by the intermembrane space.\nThe mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is located in the inner membrane, accepts electrons from nutrients such as glucose. The energy from these electrons is used to produce ATP. The electron transport chain also causes a proton (H+) gradient to build up across the inner membrane.\nThe proton gradient reflects the difference in proton concentration on either side of the inner membrane. The side of the gradient that is closest to the mitochondrial matrix has a high proton concentration, and the side closest to the intermembrane space has a low proton concentration.\nThe protons want to move from the high concentration to the low concentration. This movement is powered by the electrons as they move through the electron transport chain. The energy from the electrons is used to move protons from the matrix side to the intermembrane space side of the gradient.\nIn the space between the outer and inner membranes, there is a channel called ATP synthase. The H+ gradient pushes on a rotating shaft within the ATP synthase. This rotation drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate, using energy from the movement of the protons.\nSOLUTION: The first expected response after the application of oligomycin to cells would be an increase in H+ concentration inside the intermembrane space. Oligomycin binds to ATP synthase, which prevents the use of energy from the H+ gradient to produce ATP. Instead of producing ATP, the H+ gradient builds up in the intermembrane space."}

Cellular respiration helps to break down food and release the energy that is stored in the bonds of food molecules.\nCellular respiration has two major stages: glycolysis, which takes place in the cytosol, and the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or the TCA cycle), which takes place in the mitochondria.\nGlycolysis: The first stage of cellular respiration is glycolysis, which means \"the breaking of sugar.\" In glycolysis, one sugar molecule is broken down into two sugar molecules. This process produces two pyruvate molecules, and it also produces two ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecules.\nThe citric acid cycle: The pyruvate molecules produced in glycolysis are then processed in the citric acid cycle. In the citric acid cycle, the pyruvate molecules are changed into a compound called acetyl-CoA.\nAcetyl-CoA is then used in the citric acid cycle, which produces a total of 28-30 ATP molecules. Some of these ATP molecules are used to convert the pyruvate molecules into oxaloacetate. The remaining ATP molecules are used to form ADP (adenosine diphosphate) molecules. The ADP molecules are then converted back into ATP molecules, which can be used by the cell for energy.\nFermentation: If glycolysis and the citric acid cycle cannot be performed, cells can use an alternative process called fermentation. Fermentation converts pyruvate into a compound called lactic acid. This process does not produce ATP directly. But it does produce ATP from ADP.\nLactic acid can build up in the cell, leading to a condition called lactic acidosis. This can be harmful to the cell. So, in most cells, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are used instead of fermentation.\nThe Calvin cycle: The Calvin cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or the TCA cycle, is a series of chemical reactions that happen in the mitochondria and the nucleus. These reactions use the pyruvate produced in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to produce even more ATP.\nThe Calvin cycle also produces reduced organic compounds, such as reduced pyruvate.

The amount of parental care an animal provides can affect its reproductive success. Animals that provide more parental care have fewer offspring that are better cared for. This can increase the chances that at least some of their offspring will survive to reproduce.\nSOLUTION: An animal that requires relatively high parental care of offspring has offspring that are more likely to survive to reproduce. An animal that lives in a newly colonized habitat or is an aquatic organism has different challenges to reproduce. An animal for which the age at which the offspring themselves can give birth is relatively young will have fewer offspring."}

This movement is called water potential. The water potential of a place is a measure of how much water is at that place.\nTwo places have the same water potential if they have the same amount of water. If one place has more water than the other, the first place has a higher water potential. If one place has less water than the other, the first place has a lower water potential.\nSOLUTION: The potato is made of a type of matter called a solid. Solid matter is more dense than liquid matter.

Genes are pieces of hereditary material that are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Incomplete dominance and epistasis are two terms that describe how different alleles affect an organism's phenotype.\nIncomplete dominance describes the situation in which an organism's genotype of two alleles for a gene does not cause a clear-cut phenotype. Instead, the organism's phenotype is an intermediate version of the trait. Pea plants have incomplete dominance for the flower color gene. A plant with the genotype Ff will have flowers of a type that is a mix of purple and white.\nEpistasis describes the situation in which the effects of two alleles on an organism's phenotype are not additive. Instead, the alleles' effects interact in a way that can cause unexpected phenotypes. Epistasis can cause traits to have more than two possible phenotypes. The pea plant's phenotype for the flower color trait is a combination of purple and white flowers. This combination is caused by the interaction of the two alleles in the plant's genotype."}

DNA is made of two long strands that are coiled together.\nThe strands of DNA are called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a sugar, a base, and a phosphate group.\nThe sugar in a nucleotide is called deoxyribose. Deoxyribose does not have an oxygen atom in it.\nThe bases in a nucleotide are called adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.\nAdenine and guanine always pair with each other. Cytosine and thymine always pair with each other.\nThis pairing of bases is called base pairing. The figure below shows the four bases and how they pair.\nThe phosphate groups in a nucleotide are attached to the 5' end and the 3' end of each nucleotide. The 5' end and the 3' end indicate the two ends of the nucleotide.\nA nucleotide with a 5' end has an unpaired base. This nucleotide can pair with a nucleotide that has a 3' end.\nWhen two nucleotides pair with each other, the bases form a rung on the ladder. The ladder is made of the pairing of nucleotides.\nThe sugar and phosphate groups make up the sides of the ladder.\nThe bases form the rungs of the ladder.\nThis structure is called the double helix.\nThe two strands of the double helix are held together by hydrogen bonds.\nThe hydrogen bonds form between the bases. A cytosine on one strand can pair with a guanine on the other strand. Or, a thymine on one strand can pair with an adenine on the other strand.\nThe following drawing shows how two strands of the double helix can pair with each other.\nIn the cell, DNA replicates before the cell divides. When DNA replicates, the cell makes two copies of each strand of the double helix.\nThe two copies are called daughter strands. Each daughter strand is a copy of one of the original strands.\nThe daughter strands separate and each copy joins with a partner strand. The partners are original strands that did not separate.\nThe partners and their daughter strands now form four strands.\nThese four strands come together to form two double helices. Each double helix is made of partners and their daughter strands."}

Point mutations can have minor or major effects.\nA minor effect happens when the changed nucleotide sequence codes for an amino acid that is very similar to the one it replaced. For example, the change of a GGA codon to a GGC codon changes an amino acid that is involved in the formation of a hydrogen bond to an amino acid that is not. The protein's structure and function may change slightly, but the new amino acid is still involved in important interactions.\nA major effect happens when the changed nucleotide sequence codes for an amino acid that is not involved in the same interactions as the one it replaced. For example, the change of a GGA codon to a GTT codon changes an amino acid that is involved in hydrogen bonding to one that is not. The protein's structure and function may change significantly.\nSOLUTION: An organism's cells have the ability to repair point mutations in their genes. One way cells do this is through the process of excision repair. Before the RNA is transcribed from a gene, the cell can use excision repair to correct the point mutation. This ensures that the protein created from the corrected gene will be the protein that the cell intended.\nIf the first codon of a gene is always AUG, a leader sequence, a mutation in that sequence will have no effect on the protein produced.\nSOLUTION: Some codons code for the same amino acid. This means that a change from one codon to another will not change the amino acid that is included in the protein.\nFor example, the codons CTG and CTT code for the amino acid leCTH. If a gene has a point mutation that changes a CTG codon to a CTT codon, the protein will still have the amino acid leCTH.\nRNA processing will repair point mutations before mRNA leaves the nucleus."}

The concentration of these gases in the blood can affect how well the body's cells are receiving the oxygen they need to function properly.\nWhen the body is at rest, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood increases. When this happens, the body's cells receive less oxygen. The body has an automatic response to this situation: the rate of breathing increases, and the breaths take in more oxygen. This process helps to restore the concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood to normal levels.\nSOLUTION: Strenuous exercise is not a way that the body regulates its respiration. Instead, strenuous exercise can make the body's cells use oxygen more efficiently. As a result, the body's cells get more oxygen, but the concentration of oxygen in the blood does not change.\nAn increase in the amount of CO2 in the blood is a way that the body regulates its respiration. When the concentration of CO2 in the blood increases, the body's cells receive less oxygen. This tells the body that it needs to increase its rate of breathing. An increase in the rate of breathing brings in more oxygen, and the concentration of oxygen in the blood goes back to normal.\nA decrease in the amount of O2 in the blood is a way that the body regulates its respiration. When the concentration of O2 in the blood decreases, the body's cells receive less oxygen. This tells the body that it needs to increase its rate of breathing. An increase in the rate of breathing brings in more oxygen, and the concentration of oxygen in the blood goes back to normal.\nA decrease in the plasma pH level is a way that the body regulates its respiration. When the body's pH levels are too acidic, the body's cells will respond as if the blood's oxygen levels are too low. This will trigger an increase in the rate of breathing.

Mimicry can be Batesian or M\u00fcllerian.\nIn Batesian mimicry, the organism that is being imitated is actually harmful, and the organism doing the imitating benefits. For example, many poisonous species of butterflies have a bright, warning coloration. Other species of butterflies may mimic these poisonous species, using their warning coloration to avoid predation by birds that have learned to avoid the poisonous species.\nIn M\u00fcllerian mimicry, each of the mimicking organisms gains an advantage. For example, many species of fireflies use light to communicate with each other. Some species of fireflies are warning of their toxicity by the pattern of light they use. Other species of fireflies that are not toxic have learned to mimic the pattern of light used by the toxic species. Both types of fireflies benefit: the mimicking fireflies are not harmed by the predators that are deterred by the toxic species, and the toxic species are not harmed by predators that are deterred by the mimicking species.\nSOLUTION: An organism is displaying cryptic coloration when it is the same color as the surroundings.

One way scientists use to study this relationship is by comparing the homologous proteins or genes of different species.\nHomologous proteins or genes are ones that have a common ancestor. Scientists can use the sequence of a homologous protein or gene to determine how closely two species are related.\nThere are several ways in which the sequence of a protein or gene can change:\nAmino acid substitutions: These are changes in the sequence of an amino acid. Amino acid substitutions can cause changes in the function of a protein.\nSilent mutations: These are changes in the sequence of a base in a gene. Silent mutations do not change the function of a protein.\nGene duplications: These are copies of a gene. New copies can accumulate mutations, some of which may change the function of a protein.\nTranslocation events that change gene sequences: These are changes in the order of genes within a chromosome.

An organism's DNA is organized into genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building parts of an organism.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: An enhancer is a transcription-affecting DNA region that may be located thousands of basepairs away from the promoter.\nA promoter is a transcription-affecting DNA region that is located near the beginning of a gene. It binds to a transcription factor to begin transcription of a gene.\nA repressor is a transcription-affecting DNA region that binds to a transcription factor and keeps it from entering the nucleus.

This isolation prevents mating between the two populations. Over time, the isolated populations may evolve into separate species.\nSympatric speciation occurs when a population of organisms evolves into a new species in a short period of time while still living in the same area. This process may occur when organisms living in the same area have offspring that are born with traits that make them unable to compete with each other for resources.\nSOLUTION: The pelicans are unable to produce offspring. This is an example of genetic drift. When a small population is isolated from the main population, the chance that two individuals in the population will have offspring with the right combination of traits is low. This situation, called inbreeding, can cause harmful genes to increase in frequency in the population. Over many generations, this increase in harmful genes can change the species."}

So, when water evaporates from the surface of a pond, the remaining liquid water is concentrated. This concentration makes the remaining water more dense. And because the remaining water is more dense, it sinks.\nThis sinking of water is called a water cycle. The water cycle is a repeating pattern. The sun heats up the water. The warmed water turns into water vapor. The water vapor rises into the air.\nAs the water vapor rises, it cools. The cooled water vapor turns back into liquid water. The liquid water is in the form of water droplets. These water droplets can combine with other water droplets to form a liquid water again.\nWhen the liquid water falls back onto the surface of the earth, it is called precipitation.

This change can be harmful, but it can also cause a new species to form.\nSOLUTION: The ferns in the laboratory grew in the same place, so sympatric speciation occurred.\nThe new variant is a new species. The original variant is still the same species as the new variant."}

They do this by lowering the activation energy needed for a reaction to start. Enzymes are specific to a reaction, and each enzyme will bind to a specific substrate.\nThe enzyme substrate binding causes a change in the enzyme's shape, which makes it better at catalyzing that reaction. This new shape also puts the substrate in the right position for the reaction to occur.\nThe reaction causes the substrate to change into a product. The product is released, and the enzyme returns to its original shape.\nSome reactions need other molecules present to be catalyzed. These other molecules are called cofactors. An enzyme and its cofactors can be thought of as a reaction center.\nWhen the enzyme substrate binds to the reaction center, the cofactors are in the right place to be involved in the reaction. As the reaction takes place, the cofactors will be used up. When the cofactors are used up, the enzyme will be in its original shape again.\nSOLUTION: An agent that denatures all enzymes in the synaptic cleft will also denature the enzyme acetylcholine. Denaturing an enzyme means changing its shape.\nWhen acetylcholine is denatured, it will not be able to catalyze the reaction that produces the signal for the neurotransmitter.

{"question": "Certain populations of finches have long been isolated on the Galapagos Islands off the western coast of South America. Compared with the larger stock population of mainland finches, these separate populations exhibit far greater variation over a wider range of species. The variation among these numerous finch species is the result of", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "convergent evolution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "divergent evolution"}, {"label": "C", "text": "disruptive selection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "stabilizing selection"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Biological evolution is the change in the heritable traits of a population over time. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes can change, or mutate, spontaneously. When a mutation occurs in an organism's genes, it may change the way the organism's traits are expressed. Some of these changes may be helpful to the organism. For example, a mutation that reduces an organism's sensitivity to a toxic substance may give the organism a survival advantage.\nMany scientists think that evolution is the result of natural selection, a process in which the organisms that have the most helpful traits for a particular way of life are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, natural selection can cause the traits of a population to change.\nThere are several ways that natural selection can cause evolution:\nConvergent evolution is the process by which organisms that are not closely related become adapted to their environment in similar ways. Convergent evolution can be caused by natural selection acting on different traits. For example, birds and bats are not closely related, but both have wings. This adaptation to flying is an example of convergent evolution.\nDivergent evolution is the process by which organisms that are not closely related become adapted to their environment in different ways. Divergent evolution can be caused by natural selection acting on different traits. For example, plants and animals are not closely related, but both have cells. This adaptation to life is an example of divergent evolution.\nDisruptive selection is a type of natural selection that occurs when there are two or more different traits that are beneficial for an organism to have. For example, the type of flower a plant has may be beneficial for pollination. If different types of flowers are equally beneficial, disruptive selection will not occur. But if one type of flower is much more beneficial than the others, natural selection will act on that type. This will cause the less beneficial types of flowers to disappear over time.\nStabilizing selection is a type of natural selection that occurs when most types of an organism's traits are beneficial. For example, a bird's beak is an important trait. Natural selection will act to keep each bird's beak close to the average beak size. This type of selection keeps the population's traits within a normal range.\nSOLUTION: The finches on the Galapagos Islands are a great example of a population of organisms that have evolved into many different species. This evolution happened in a relatively short amount of time.\nThe Galapagos finches have evolved by both divergent evolution and convergent evolution. Divergent evolution has caused the finches to adapt to their different environments on the different islands. The finches' beaks, for example, have evolved to become specialized for different foods.\nConvergent evolution has also caused the finches to adapt to their different environments. The finches' beaks have evolved to become specialized for different foods in a similar way to the different species of finches on the mainland."}

When bacterial cells have children, their offspring inherit their genes. Offspring can make changes to their genes. If these changes help the bacteria survive and reproduce, the changes will be passed down to the offspring. Over many generations, bacteria can evolve into new species.\nViral transduction plays a role in bacterial evolution by increasing genetic variation. When a virus transduces its DNA into a bacterial cell, the bacterial cell becomes a hybrid of the bacteria and the virus. The hybrid cell has genes from both the bacteria and the virus. Offspring of the hybrid cell will have a mixture of genes from the bacteria and the virus. This mixture of genes is a new combination that may help the bacteria survive and reproduce.\nIf the bacteria can use the virus's genes to survive, the bacteria and the virus may have an advantage over other bacteria that do not have these genes. For example, the bacteria may be able to resist predators. Or, the bacteria may be able to use nutrients in a different way.\nOver many generations, bacteria that become hybrids may have an advantage over bacteria that do not. Hybrids may survive and reproduce in situations where non-hybrids cannot. As a result, hybrids may come to dominate the population. This dominance will make up a new species of bacteria."}

For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nThe Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a model that describes how genotypes and phenotypes are passed from parents to offspring. According to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, if certain conditions are met, the allele frequencies in a population will stay the same from generation to generation.\nThere are seven conditions that must be met for a population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:\n1. The population must be large.\n2. All offspring must be produced by random mating.\n3. The population must be closed, with no migration of organisms into or out of the population.\n4. The population must have a fixed environment.\n5. No new alleles can be added to the population.\n6. The population must be in mutation equilibrium, with the rate of mutations keeping constant the frequencies of alleles.\n7. The population must be in selection equilibrium, with no directional selection or disruptive selection affecting the populations of alleles.\nIf any of these conditions are not met, the population will not be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The deviation of a population from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is called genetic drift.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, consider whether each of the seven conditions is met.\nThis population has a large population size.\nThis population produces offspring by random mating.\nThis population is closed.\nThis population has a fixed environment.\nThis population has no new alleles.\nThis population is in mutation equilibrium.\nThis population is in selection equilibrium.\nThis population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium."}

At allosteric sites, the molecule's function is regulated by binding to other molecules.\nThe effect of a change in concentration at an allosteric site is opposite to the effect of the same change in concentration at a primary site. This happens because the allosteric site and primary site have opposite responses to changes in the concentration of the regulating molecule.\nSOLUTION: Hemoglobin is an allosteric molecule. Its activity changes in response to changes in the concentration of O2 and CO2.\nHemoglobin's affinity for O2 increases when the concentration of CO2 decreases.

Soaps have a polar hydrophilic, or water-loving, end and a nonpolar hydrophobic, or water-fearing, end. The hydrophilic end of the soap molecule is attracted to water, and the hydrophobic end is repelled by it. The balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts in a soap molecule affects how well the molecule mixes with water.\nWhen a soap molecule is placed in water, the hydrophilic end of the molecule quickly becomes surrounded by water. These water molecules are attracted to the hydrophilic end of the soap molecule because of the polar bonds in the water molecule. The hydrophobic end of the molecule is repelled by the water. This separation of the polar and nonpolar parts of the soap molecule into different environments is called micellization.\nMicellized soap molecules have a water-loving end and a water-fearing end. The water-loving end is attracted to water, and the water-fearing end is repelled by it. Because the micellized soap molecule is attractive to water on one end and repels water on the other end, the molecule quickly becomes surrounded by water. This process is called micellization.\nWhen a drop of soap is added to a leaf, the soap molecules bond to the leaf and change the surface of the leaf. The oily texture of the leaf is now surrounded by microscopic soap particles. When the leaf is placed in water, the water surrounds the soap-covered leaf, and the leaf sinks.\nSOLUTION: The soap molecules bond to the oily leaf surface and change the surface of the leaf. This makes the leaf more water-like and less oily. When the leaf is placed in water, the water surrounds the soap-covered leaf, and the leaf sinks."}

When a system is regulated by feedback, it has a loop in which a part of the system's output is fed back into the system as a input. The feedback signal helps to keep the system's output at a desired level.\nAn example of a feedback mechanism is the regulation of temperature in an organism. When the body temperature rises, the temperature-sensing cells of the brain release a chemical messenger that stimulates sweat glands to produce sweat. The sweat cools the body, which causes the temperature to decrease. This process keeps the body's temperature within a normal range.\nSOLUTION: The feedback mechanism is positive. When the product of the reaction is sensed by the enzyme, it is allosterically inhibited. This reduces the rate of the reaction, which causes the product to decrease. When the product decreases, the enzyme is no longer inhibited. This allows the reaction to proceed at a faster rate, which increases the product. As a result of the increased product, the enzyme is allosterically inhibited again. This positive-feedback loop amplifies the effect of the reaction.\nThe other answers describe examples of negative feedback, in which the output of a system is fed back into the system in order to reduce the output."}

It is a slow process that takes place over many generations.\nPopulations of organisms, including people, are always changing. Some of these changes are passed down through families. These changes are called heritable.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes can have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Natural selection is the most consistent agent of evolution. It is a process that happens over many generations.\nDuring natural selection, some heritable traits are passed down from parents to offspring. These traits can cause different versions of a trait to appear in a population. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. Some pea plants have flowers that are purple or white.\nOffspring receive their alleles for a gene, or trait, from their parents. Offspring can receive alleles that are the same as, or different from, their parents' alleles.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

This evolution is determined by the ways in which organisms with traits use their traits to survive and reproduce.\nEvolution is not directed by a particular goal. Instead, an organism's genes influence its traits. These traits affect the ways an organism looks and acts. An organism's genes can also affect which diseases it may have.\nGenes can change, or mutate, over time. When a gene mutation occurs, a new trait may emerge. If this new trait is helpful to an organism, it may survive better and have more offspring. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their traits, from their parents. Over many generations, the genes of an organism can change in response to its environment. This process of change is called evolution.\nThere are many different ways that organisms can evolve. Some of the ways that organisms can evolve include:\nConvergent evolution: This is when organisms that are not closely related use similar traits to adapt to similar environments. This process can result in the independent evolution of very similar traits.\nFor example, birds and bats use their wings to fly. This is an example of convergent evolution. Birds and bats are not closely related to each other, but they have both evolved to use their wings to fly.\nDivergent evolution: This is when organisms that are closely related use different traits to adapt to different environments. This process can result in the independent evolution of very different traits.\nFor example, dogs and cats are closely related to each other. But dogs have a strong sense of smell, and cats have excellent night vision.\nParallel evolution: This is when organisms that are not closely related use similar traits to adapt to similar environments. This process can result in the independent evolution of very similar traits.\nFor example, the similarities between the bacteria that live in the human gut and the bacteria that live on the skin of sheep are an example of parallel evolution.\nCoevolution: This is when two organisms that interact with each other evolve together.\nFor example, the relationship between flowers and bees is a coevolution. Bees evolved to have specialized structures that allows them to obtain nectar from flowers. Flowers evolved to have specialized structures that attract bees to them.\nSOLUTION: The passage discusses a type of evolution called coevolution. In coevolution, two organisms that interact with each other evolve together.\nTetris and Munch, a game and its theme music, coevolved. The game was designed before the music was composed. But the music was created to fit the game.\nThe game and its music are not closely related. But they have evolved together."}

Mitochondria generate ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, which is the primary source of energy for cells. The mitochondrial membrane is separated into an inner and outer membrane. The inner membrane is surrounded by the mitochondrial matrix.\nThylakoid is a component of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts use energy from ATP and NADPH to convert sunlight into sugar. The thylakoid membrane contains thylakoid vesicles, which are compartments that are surrounded by the membrane.\nBoth mitochondria and chloroplasts have mechanisms for maintaining the concentration of hydrogen ions across their membranes. In these organelles, hydrogen ions are stored on the inside of the membrane. This concentration difference can be used to produce ATP.\nSOLUTION: Plant and fungal cells have mitochondria and chloroplasts. Mammalian cells have mitochondria, but they do not have chloroplasts.\nMuscle and nerve cells are types of mammalian cells. Muscle cells use ATP to do work, such as moving your hand. Nerve cells use ATP to send signals, such as when you touch your hand to a hot stove.\nMammalian cells have a similar mechanism for generating ATP as plant and fungal cells. So, you would expect to find proton pumps in the plasma membranes of mammalian cells."}

Genes can have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSOLUTION: This is a true statement about genetic variation: It arises in response to changes in the environment.\nWhen an organism's environment changes, some genotypes may be better adapted to the new environment than other genotypes. Organisms with better-adapted genotypes for the new environment are more likely to survive and produce offspring. Over time, the population's genotype frequencies will change to reflect the new environment. This is a process called genetic drift."}

It is a complex microscopic structure that filters the blood and helps regulate water and electrolyte levels in the body.\nThe nephron consists of several parts. As blood flows through them, waste products and excess ions are removed and excreted as urine.\nThe glomerulus is the part of the nephron that filters blood.\nThe proximal convoluted tubule and the loop of Henle reabsorb water and ions that were filtered out by the glomerulus.\nThe distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ions and excretes metabolic wastes.\nThe collecting duct collects filtrate from the tubules and releases it into the pelvis of the kidney.\nSOLUTION: The primary site of glucose reabsorption is the proximal convoluted tubule. Here, the filtrate is reabsorbed back into the blood."}

The changes that occur are passed from parents to offspring.\nOffspring receive their traits, including their genes, from their parents. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nNatural selection occurs when organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce than organisms with less advantageous traits.\nAdvantageous traits include both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited traits are passed down through families. Acquired traits are gained during a person's life.\nSOLUTION: This statement is most correct:\nDifferent species that occupy the same habitat will adapt to that habitat by undergoing the same genetic changes.\nHabitats are not the same as times. A habitat is an environment, and a population of organisms that occupy the same habitat are exposed to the same selection pressures. So, organisms that live in the same habitat will experience the same natural selection forces."}

Cellular respiration processes the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe to produce the energy that cells need to survive.\nThere are three main stages of cellular respiration.\n1. The process of glycolysis breaks down glucose, or sugar, into two three-carbon sugars. This process requires oxygen and produces two ATP molecules.\n2. The process of pyruvate oxidation, or the Krebs cycle, converts the three-carbon sugars into a six-carbon sugar and produces four more ATP molecules.\n3. The process of oxidative phosphorylation, or chemiosmosis, uses the energy from electron transport to produce ATP. This process also produces ATP by coupling the movement of electrons to the movement of protons.\nSOLUTION: This process occurs during oxidative phosphorylation, or chemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis couples the production of ATP with the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain by harnessing the driving force created by a proton gradient."}

The membrane must be semipermeable, or partially permeable, to water. In an organism, cells are made up of a membrane that is semipermeable to water. This means that water moves through the membrane, from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration.\nWhen a potato is immersed in water, the water moves from the water into the potato. This water movement is osmosis. Since the potato is made of cellulose, a polymer, the water cannot enter the potato cells. Instead, the potato cells swell up with water. This process is called plasmolysis.\nSOLUTION: Since the potato is made of cellulose, a polymer, the water cannot enter the potato cells. Instead, the water moves from the surrounding water into the potato. This water movement is osmosis."}
