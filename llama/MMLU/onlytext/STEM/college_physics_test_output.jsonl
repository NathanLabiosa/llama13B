For a two-electron atom, there are two possible electron spin configurations, or states. The electron spins can be parallel or antiparallel.\nThe Pauli exclusion principle and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle can be used to explain why the para-state has higher energy than the ortho-state. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same four quantum numbers. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle, such as an electron, cannot be known exactly at the same time.\nConsider the electron spin and the two possible electron spin configurations for the helium atom. The electron spin is a measure of how the electron spins are arranged. The first electron spin can be arranged in any of the two possible ways. The second electron spin must align with the first electron spin. So, there are two possible arrangements for the two electron spins.\nThe ortho-state is one of these two arrangements. The para-state is the other arrangement.\nThe energy of an excited state is a measure of the energy required to change an atom from its ground state to the excited state. To change a helium atom from its ground state to its first excited state, the two electron spins must be rearranged.

A capacitor with a larger capacitance can store more electric charge than a capacitor with a smaller capacitance.\nSOLUTION: When the first capacitor is charged to a voltage and then disconnected from the battery, the first capacitor does not discharge.

Spectra provide information about the chemical elements and chemical bonds in atoms.\nSpectra contain two types of information: lines and bands.\nLines in a spectrum are caused by transitions within an atom. As an electron moves from one energy level to another within an atom, it is emitting or absorbing electromagnetic radiation. Because each element has a different number of energy levels, each element will have a different set of lines in its spectrum.\nBands in a spectrum are caused by transitions between the atoms in a molecule.

In an excited helium atom, the two electrons have the same angular momentum quantum number. So, according to the Pauli exclusion principle, the two electrons must have different orbital quantum numbers.\nThe para- and ortho- states of the helium atom result from the different orbital quantum numbers of the two electrons. The para- state has one electron in an orbital with a higher angular momentum quantum number than the other electron. The ortho- state has both electrons in orbitals with the same angular momentum quantum number.\nBecause the ortho- state has lower energy than the para- state, the energy difference must be due to the difference in the angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons. The angular momentum quantum number is determined by the orbital quantum number and the value of the electron's angular momentum.\nHelium has only one electron, so the orbital quantum number can have a value of 0, 1, or 2. The angular momentum quantum number is 0 for the ground state, 1 for the first excited state, and 2 for the second excited state.\nThe para- state has an orbital quantum number of 1, and the ortho- state has an orbital quantum number of 0.

The diagram below shows how the detector's detection efficiency changes as the photon's energy increases.\nThe detector's quantum efficiency is 0.1, or 10%. This means that each time a photon with an energy equal to or greater than the detector's threshold energy passes through the detector, the detector will detect the photon.\nThe detector's threshold energy is 1.5 electron volts (eV).

For example, the 3rd harmonic is three times the fundamental frequency.\nIf an organ pipe is open at both ends, the air in the pipe is vibrating at the same frequency as the sound that is produced. But some of the frequencies produced by the pipe are harmonics of the fundamental frequency.\nThese harmonics will mix with the fundamental frequency to produce a sound that is heard. But each harmonic is a separate frequency. So, when the pipe is closed at one end, some harmonics will not be heard.\nThe 50 Hz harmonic will survive when the pipe is closed at one end. But the 250 Hz harmonic will not.\nThe 100 Hz and 200 Hz harmonics are odd harmonics.

They are made of a heavy object, or bob, that is attached to a string. As a simple pendulum swings, the string applies a force to the bob. This force is called a restoring force because it tries to reverse the direction of the bob.\nThe restoring force is not present when the bob is not moving. So, the bob will keep moving until it is completely stopped by air resistance or by hitting something.\nSOLUTION: The period of a pendulum is equal to the time it takes to swing back and forth. The period does not depend on how fast the pendulum is swinging.\nSo, the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A. The periods are:\nT_B = 2T_A.\nThe length of a pendulum is equal to the distance from the center of the pendulum to the point where the string is not touching the pendulum.

One of the key ideas in understanding superconductors is the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory.\nAccording to the BCS theory, the attraction between Cooper pairs in a superconductor is due to interactions with the ionic lattice.\nA Cooper pair is made up of two atoms that have joined together to form a single quantum object. This object acts like a single particle, with properties of both atoms combined. Cooper pairs can carry electricity without resistances.\nIn a superconductor, the interactions between the Cooper pairs and the atoms in the ionic lattice create an attraction that binds the pairs together. This attraction helps to keep the pairs from interacting with normal matter and, as a result, keeps the superconductor from having any electrical resistance.\nSOLUTION: The BCS theory says that the attraction between Cooper pairs in a superconductor is due to interactions with the ionic lattice.

This means that the two spectra are the same.\nBoth hydrogen and doubly ionized lithium have one electron. When an electron changes energy levels, it can absorb or emit electromagnetic radiation. The absorption or emission of radiation creates a change in the emission spectrum.\nThe emission spectrum of a hydrogen atom is a series of lines.

This means that the beam will change direction. The diffraction pattern is a pattern of bright spots.\nThe spacing of bright spots in the pattern is called the diffraction pattern. The diffraction pattern is related to the wavelength of the electron and the lattice spacing of the crystal. The lattice spacing is the distance between the atoms in the crystal.\nThe wavelength of an electron is given by:\n\u03bb = h/p\nwhere h is the Planck constant and p is the magnitude of the electron's momentum.\nThe momentum of an electron is given by:\np = m*v\nwhere m is the mass of the electron and v is its speed.\nSo, the wavelength of an electron is related to its momentum and mass. The wavelength of an electron is much shorter than the lattice spacing of a crystal. So, the diffraction pattern has a much higher resolution than the crystal lattice.\nSOLUTION: To see the diffraction pattern, the electron beam must have a kinetic energy that is high enough to produce bright spots that are visible. The energy of an electron is related to its momentum by the equation:\nE = h*v + m*v^2/2\nwhere E is the energy of the electron, h is the Planck constant, m is the mass of the electron, and v is its speed.\nWhen an electron's speed increases, its kinetic energy increases. So, the bright spots in the diffraction pattern will be visible when the electron beam has a kinetic energy that is greater than zero.\nThe approximate minimum kinetic energy needed for an electron to see the diffraction pattern is when the electron's speed is just enough to escape the crystal. This requires the electron to have a kinetic energy of 1 eV."}

The protons and neutrons in a nucleus are bound together by a force called the strong nuclear force.\nThe mass of a proton is about 1,800 times smaller than the mass of a neutron.

The energy of a photon is equal to the energy difference between the two states of the positronium atom.\nThe energy of a photon is given by the equation E = mc\u00b2.
