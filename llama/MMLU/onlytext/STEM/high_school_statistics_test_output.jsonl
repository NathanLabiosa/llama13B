It is used when we need to decide whether an effect or relationship exists between two variables.\nIn a hypothesis test, we choose the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\nThe null hypothesis is usually the claim that is tested. The null hypothesis is usually a claim of \"no effect\" or \"no relationship.\"\nThe alternative hypothesis is the claim that is often opposite the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is usually a claim of \"an effect\" or \"a relationship.\"\nWe collect data and calculate a test statistic. The test statistic tells you how far the data are from what would be expected if the null hypothesis were true.\nWe compare the test statistic to a critical value. The critical value is a cutoff point that is based on the level of significance of the hypothesis test. If the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.\nThere are many different levels of significance. The most common levels of significance are 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.\nThe level of significance is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\nA common misunderstanding is that the level of significance is the probability of the null hypothesis being true. This is incorrect.\nThe level of significance is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\nIf the level of significance is 0.05, then the critical value is the value that is exceeded 5% of the time when the null hypothesis is true.\nIf the level of significance is 0.10, then the critical value is the value that is exceeded 10% of the time when the null hypothesis is true.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nThe power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\nA two-sided test is a test that evaluates an alternative hypothesis with two possible outcomes.

The research question is what the research is about. The hypotheses are statements that can be tested by the research. In many cases, there are two hypotheses: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\nThe null hypothesis is the statement that the research is trying to disprove. The null hypothesis is often denoted by the symbol H0. The null hypothesis says that there is no effect or no difference.\nThe alternative hypothesis is the statement that the research is trying to prove. The alternative hypothesis is often denoted by the symbol H1. The alternative hypothesis says that there is an effect or a difference.\nThe goal of a research study is to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This decision is called a significance test. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it is said that the evidence is significant.\nThe researcher chooses the significance level, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. The significance level is often set to 0.05.\nIf the significance level is 0.05, the researcher can reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic is less than 0.05. If the test statistic is greater than or equal to 0.05, the researcher fails to reject the null hypothesis.\nThe test statistic is a value that is calculated from the data. It tells you how much the data differ from what would be expected if the null hypothesis were true.\nThe power of a test is the probability that the test will detect a real difference if one exists. A test with a power of 0.80 has a 80% chance of detecting a real difference.\nSOLUTION: The experiment is planned to have twice as many experimental units for each treatment. This means that the experiment will have more data. As a result of having more data, the power of the test will increase. The power of the test is 0.80, which is up from 0.64.\nThe probability of a Type I error and the power will both increase."}

A hypothesis test begins with a claim (a hypothesis) and evidence (data).\nTo test a hypothesis, you try to determine if the evidence supports the claim. This is done by assessing the probability that the observed data would arise from a population with the claim. This probability is called the p-value.\nThe p-value is a measure of the strength of the evidence against the claim. A low p-value indicates that the evidence strongly supports the claim. The decision to accept the claim is made when the p-value is less than a specific Critical Value.\nThe critical value is a threshold for the p-value. The critical value is chosen to make the test as accurate as possible. For example, if the critical value is 0.05, then the decision to accept the claim is made when the p-value is less than 0.05.\nSOLUTION: The hypothesis test yields a P-value of 0.20.

Each block is made up of groups that are similar to each other in terms of a particular variable.\nSOLUTION: To test a new cholesterol-reducing drug, the pharmaceutical company wants to compare it to the previous drug. The company does not expect gender to be associated with cholesterol level. But it does expect exercise level to be associated with cholesterol level.\nA randomized block design is proposed. For this design, participants are assigned to groups by random grouping. The groups are then assigned to blocks.\nTo determine the blocks, the pharmaceutical company chooses to block on exercise level because exercise level is associated with cholesterol level."}

The normal distribution is bell-shaped, with the peak of the bell located at the mean of the distribution.\nThe standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the distribution. A distribution with a larger standard deviation is wider than a distribution with a smaller standard deviation.\nA normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 has a peak of the bell at 50.

The mean daily baking is 3,000 loaves, and the mean daily demand is 2,500 loaves. So, the bakery is baking 3,000 loaves every morning, but only demanding 2,500 loaves every day.

A Type I error is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, true. This probability is called the alpha level.\nThe alpha level is commonly set to 0.05.

An outlier is a point that is much larger or smaller than the other points. An influential point is a point that has a large effect on the results of a statistical calculation.\nA point that is not an outlier or an influential point is a typical point.\nIf a point is an outlier, it may affect the regression line and the correlation coefficient. The regression line is a line that is used to predict the y-values of a set of x-values. The correlation coefficient is a value between -1 and 1 that describes the strength of the relationship between two sets of values.\nFor a set of points, the correlation coefficient can be calculated by following these steps:\n1. Calculate the mean of the x-values and the mean of the y-values.\n2. Calculate the difference between each x-value and the mean of the x-values.\n3. Calculate the difference between each y-value and the mean of the y-values.\n4. Calculate the product of the difference between each x-value and the mean of the y-values.\n5. Calculate the product of the difference between each y-value and the mean of the x-values.\n6. Calculate the correlation coefficient as the ratio of the product from step 5 to the product from step 4.\nIf a point is influential, it may affect the regression line. A change in the y-value of an influential point will cause a new regression line to be calculated.\nA point is not an outlier or an influential point if it is a typical point.\nSOLUTION: The point (15,2) is included, the slope of the regression line is -0.54. When the point is removed, the new slope is -1.04. The new slope is different from the old slope. So, the removal of the point is significant.\nWhen the point is removed, the correlation coefficient is -0.95. This indicates a strong negative correlation between the two sets of values. The correlation coefficient of -0.82 is also strongly negative. But -0.95 is more strongly negative than -0.82. So, the removal of the point is significant."}
