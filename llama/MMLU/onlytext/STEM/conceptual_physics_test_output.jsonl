The total amount of electric charge in a circuit is determined by the power source. The current in a circuit is equal to the amount of electric charge that flows through the circuit.\nImagine being a water in a hose. The water flowing out of the hose is the current in the hose. The pressure in the hose is the power source. The amount of water that flows out of the hose in a certain amount of time is called the flow rate. The amount of water that flows out of the hose in a certain amount of time is determined by the flow rate and the time.\nCurrent is similar to flow rate. The current in a circuit is determined by the power source and the resistance in the circuit. The resistance in a circuit is the same as the resistance in a wire. The resistance in a wire depends on the type of wire and its length.\nSOLUTION: More lamps are connected in parallel in a circuit. So, the current in the power source increases."}

Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about an object that is moving for a certain distance in a certain amount of time. The diagram below shows that the object's speed can be affected by different factors.\nIf the object is moving directly toward you, the object's groundspeed is equal to the distance the object has moved and the time the object has spent moving.\nIf the object is moving in the same direction as the wind, the object's groundspeed is equal to the distance the object has moved and the time the object has spent moving. But the object's speed is also pushed up by the wind.\nIf the object is moving against the wind, the object's groundspeed is equal to the distance the object has moved and the time the object has spent moving. But the object's speed is also slowed down by the wind.\nSOLUTION: Use the crosswind to figure out how long the airplane has spent moving. The crosswind is at a 30-km/h angle to the airplane's direction of motion. So, the airplane has moved 30 km/h to the right.\nThe airplane has spent 30 km/h \u00d7 1 hour = 30 km/h moving to the right.\nThe airplane's groundspeed is 40 km/h.

So, thermal conduction involves the transfer of energy from one type of matter to another.\nThermal conduction involves mainly the transfer of energy from high-temperature atoms to low-temperature atoms. The high-temperature atoms transfer their energy to the nearby low-temperature atoms, heating them up in the process.\nSOLUTION: Neutrons do not take part in thermal conduction. They do not transfer their energy to other types of matter.\nProtons and electrons are part of atoms. These charged particles take part in thermal conduction. When an atom gains energy, its protons and electrons do, too.\nAn atom that gains energy may transmit some of its extra energy to a nearby atom. This can happen because the two atoms are attracted to each other by their electrical charges.\nAn atom that receives the extra energy will have more protons and electrons in high-energy states. These high-energy states are called excited states.\nAn atom in an excited state does not stay that way for long. It will soon return to its ground state. But during that time, it may transfer its extra energy to a nearby atom.\nThis process of transferring energy from one atom to another continues until the energy is absorbed by an atom that does not want it. This atom has too many protons and electrons in high-energy states. It has reached its maximum capacity to absorb energy."}

Current is a measure of how much electric charge is moving through a wire.\nThe current in a wire depends on two things: the amount of electric charge that is flowing and the resistance of the wire. The amount of electric charge that is flowing is called the current. The resistance of the wire affects the amount of current that is produced. Ohm's law states that the current through a wire is directly proportional to the voltage across the wire and inversely proportional to its resistance.\nSOLUTION: Compared with the current in an LED lamp, the current in the connecting wire is less. The LED lamp is the source of the current. The connecting wire is just a path for the current to follow.

The medium can be thought of as the stuff that the waves move through. The medium can also move, but that is not the same as a wave. For example, the ocean is a medium that supports a wave, but the ocean itself can also move.\nWhen waves move through a medium, they may bump into each other. When these bumps happen, the waves interact. These interactions can be described in terms of how the waves combine, or interact, with each other.\nThree ways waves can interact are:\nConstructive interference: When two waves are the same type and are moving in the same direction, they will combine, or interfere, to make a larger wave.\nDestructive interference: When two waves are the same type and are moving in the same direction, they will combine, or interfere, to make a smaller wave.\nOvertaking: When a wave is moving faster than another wave, the faster wave will overtake, or pass, the slower wave.\nThe ways waves interact can change as the waves move. For example, two waves that are overtaking each other will eventually move beyond each other.\nSOLUTION: A bow wave is produced by waves of water. So, the water moves slower than the source producing it."}

Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.\nA change in momentum is caused by a force. Momentum is a measure of an object's mass and speed. If an object's momentum changes, the object's speed or its mass must change.\nA torque is a twisting force. A force is a torque if it tends to rotate an object.\nWhen a force is applied to an object, the object will rotate. The magnitude of the torque produced by a force is equal to the force's magnitude and is applied at a distance from the object's center.\nAn energy is a measure of the ability of a force to do work.

It has some unique properties which help to keep the Earth livable.\nWater is a natural solvent. This means it can break up and mix with other substances. Water helps to break down nutrients in food and make them available for plants and animals to use.\nWater is a good source of energy. When water is turned into a gas, it can rise and carry off large quantities of energy. This gas is called water vapor. Water vapor can lift large objects, such as clouds.\nWater has a high boiling point. The boiling point of water is 100\u00b0 Celsius (212\u00b0 Fahrenheit). This means it takes a lot of energy to turn water into a gas.\nSOLUTION: Water is a good solvent. This property is a result of the special bonding within water. Each water molecule is composed of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. The oxygen atom is bonded to the hydrogen atoms by a strong bond. The hydrogen atoms are bonded to the oxygen atom by weak bonds.\nBecause the oxygen atom is bonded to the hydrogen atoms by a strong bond, the oxygen atom is able to pull the hydrogen atoms to itself. This leaves an oxygen atom with two hydrogen atoms bonded to it. This is called a hydroxyl group.\nA hydroxyl group can act as a solvent. It can break up and mix with other substances.\nWater has a high boiling point and a high melting point. A high boiling point means that a lot of energy is required to turn water into a gas. A high melting point means that a lot of energy is required to change water from a solid to a liquid.\nThese properties of water help to keep the Earth livable. Water is able to store and move large quantities of energy. This energy is important for the weather and climate."}

These waves carry information about the universe, and scientists hope that they will find answers to many questions by studying these waves.\nGravitational waves spread out as they move through space, and their speed is affected by the strength of the gravity between objects. For this reason, the time it takes for gravitational waves to reach Earth from a distant star explosion depends on the mass of the star and the strength of the gravity between the star and Earth.\nSOLUTION: Look at the distance of the star from Earth and the speed of gravitational waves.\nThe star is 20 light-years from Earth. One light-year is 5.88 trillion miles. So, the star is 117.12 trillion miles from Earth.\nGravitational waves move at the speed of light. So, they travel 5.88 trillion miles in 20 years."}

The molecules swap positions with each other, and the fastest molecules slow down while the slowest molecules speed up. This movement of molecules is called random motion.\nWhen random motion happens, the molecules in a mixture reach an equal number of speeds. So, the fastest molecules on average are not necessarily the same as the fastest molecules at any one time.\nSOLUTION: To determine the fastest molecules on average, look at the atoms in each gas.\nHydrogen has one atom. Oxygen has eight atoms. Nitrogen has seven atoms.\nThe atom in a substance is the part that makes the substance different from other substances.\nSo, hydrogen has the fastest average speed of the three gases."}

Wavelength and refraction are not the same for each color.\nSOLUTION: Look at the diagram of the prism. The prism has two triangles. The white light enters the prism at the top triangle and exits from the bottom triangle.\nAs the light enters the prism, each color refracts. The blue light refracts more than the green light. So, the blue light bends away from the green light."}

The horizontal component of velocity describes the baseball's speed side to side. The baseball's vertical component of velocity describes the baseball's speed up and down.\nSo, the component of velocity that can remain constant for a tossed baseball is the vertical component."}

When particles vibrate, they create a disturbance, or a change in the pattern of the matter. This disturbance is called a wave.\nThe distance between the particles in the disturbance is called the wavelength. The time it takes for the particles to vibrate through one distance is the frequency.\nThe pattern of the disturbance looks like a sine wave. The sine wave is made up of two parts: the oscillation and the envelope.\nThe oscillation is the part of the sine wave that shows the frequency.\nThe envelope is the part of the sine wave that shows the amplitude, which is a measure of the strength of the disturbance.\nInterference happens when two waves meet. The waves can bend, or interfere, with each other in one of two ways: constructive interference or destructive interference.\nConstructive interference happens when the waves reinforce, or add, to each other. The particles in the waves move together to create a disturbance with a higher amplitude.\nDestructive interference happens when the waves cancel, or subtract, from each other. The particles in the waves move in opposite directions, which cancels the disturbance.\nResonance happens when a disturbance has a frequency that matches the frequency of the particles in the matter. The particles vibrate with the greatest amplitude when they are set into motion by a disturbance that has a frequency that matches their own frequency. This is called resonance.\nAmplification happens when the amplitude of a wave increases. This can happen when a wave encounters a material with a different amplitude. For example, a sound wave can travel through the air with an amplitude of 1. If the sound wave encounters a material with an amplitude of 2, the sound wave's amplitude becomes 2."}

At first, scientists expected that the photoelectric effect would be explained by the wave model. But the photoelectric effect was found to follow the particle model.\nThe particle model of light tells you that light is made of particles, or quanta, called photons. Photons have both an energy and a frequency.\nThe energy of a photon is equal to its frequency. So, the energy of light is determined by the frequency of the light.\nThe frequency of light is determined by the color of the light. For example, orange light has a higher frequency than red light.

After n hours, there will be only 1/2^n of the substance left.\nSOLUTION: You can use the formula to calculate how much of a radioactive substance remains after a certain number of hours.\nThe formula is:\nA = A0 * 0.5^n\nA is the amount that remains after n hours.\nA0 is the original amount.\nn is the number of hours that have passed."}

The top side of the branch is farthest from the center of the tree, and it stretches to support the weight of the branch.\nThe bottom side of the branch is in compression. The bottom side of the branch is closest to the center of the tree, and it squeezes to support the weight of the branch.\nSOLUTION: When you bend the branch of a tree by hanging on its end, the top side of the branch is under tension. To balance the tension, the tree uses compression to keep the branch from breaking."}

When this happens, the object is in mechanical equilibrium.\nA car traveling at a constant speed is a simple example of an object in mechanical equilibrium. The forces of friction acting on the car in both directions are equal and opposite.\nThese conditions are not necessarily true for an object that is orbiting a planet. An object that is orbiting a planet is not in mechanical equilibrium. Instead, the object is always falling towards the planet. But the object's tangential velocity is also constantly increasing, which keeps the object from hitting the planet.\nSOLUTION: An object is in orbit around a planet when the object is always falling towards the planet, but the object's tangential velocity is also constantly increasing.\nThis is why an object in orbit around a planet is always above the planet's surface. If an object in orbit were to slow down, it would descend.\nAn object in orbit around a planet is not in mechanical equilibrium. An object that is not in mechanical equilibrium is not balanced between gravitational and centripetal forces.\nAn object that is orbiting a planet is beyond the main pull of the planet's gravity. An object that is beyond the main pull of a planet's gravity is not falling around the planet."}
