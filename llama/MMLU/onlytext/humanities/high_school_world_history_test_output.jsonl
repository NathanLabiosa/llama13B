Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms."}, {"label": "B", "text": "can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India."}, {"label": "C", "text": "should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression."}, {"label": "D", "text": "seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": ""}

We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.\nFrench revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794\nWith which of the following threats does the speaker in the passage above seem most concerned?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Counterrevolutionary opponents"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Foreign invaders"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Communist agitators"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Transnational corporations"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Maximum security involves controlling access to a place or system. To do this, you need to determine who or what is allowed to enter and who or what is not.\nThere are many ways to determine security. One way is to assign security levels to each person or object that is allowed to enter. For example, you can assign a higher security level to a president than to a visitor.\nAnother way is to determine who is requesting entry. For example, if a visitor is requesting entry, check to see if they are accompanied by a guard. If the visitor is not accompanied by a guard, do not let them in.\nA security system can also use a combination of these methods.\nSOLUTION: The passage is concerned with the French Revolution. It is talking about the need to smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic. The passage does not mention foreign invaders, transnational corporations, or counterrevolutionary opponents. It does mention Communist agitators."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . .

Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.

It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

The natives had not developed immunity to these diseases, such as smallpox and influenza.\nAs a result of this population decline, the invaders did not have to fight large-scale wars to conquer the Americas. Instead, they were able to defeat the remaining natives through the use of alliances with other invaders and by forcing native people to work for them.\nThe system of forced labor that arose from this situation was called the encomienda system. Under this system, Spanish and Portuguese noblemen were granted land rights to groups of natives, who were required to work for the noblemen. The natives had to work the land to produce goods that they were required to give to the noblemen.\nThe encomienda system was soon adopted by other European invaders, including the English. In 1620, the English invader John Puntas was granted an encomienda of the land inhabited by the Pokanoket people. This grant gave Puntas the right to use the labor of the Pokanoket people to produce crops and goods."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope\u2026\n\u2026The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter.

Some societies have chosen to organize their economies through capitalism, in which individuals and businesses are the primary economic actors. In a capitalist economy, people are allowed to own and run their own businesses, and they are expected to try to make a profit.\nOther societies have chosen to organize their economies through socialism, in which the government is the primary economic actor.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

The transforming of an industrial society into an information society is called informatization. Both processes were begun in Europe and the United States in the 18th century and have continued to the present.\nDuring industrialization, farmers and people who worked in small businesses moved to cities to work in factories. The factories produced goods using machines. This process transformed the way goods were produced.\nDuring informatization, machines called computers were invented. Computers could perform tasks that would take humans a long time to do. As a result, humans no longer needed to do some of the jobs that they had been doing.\nIn both cases, new ways of producing goods and running businesses caused problems as well as solutions.\nIndustrialization and informatization have also changed how people live their daily lives. For example, industrialization made it possible for people to buy goods that were mass-produced in factories. Informatization has made it possible for people to have information at their fingertips.\nSOLUTION: The second passage suggests that the independence was not achieved.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute.

Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.

Reincarnation suggests that the cycle of birth, life, and death is ongoing, and that individuals have many opportunities over many lifetimes to achieve spiritual growth.\nThe excerpt from the Upanishads illustrates the concept of reincarnation. It is often quoted in discussions of karma, the idea that individuals are responsible for the circumstances of their lives and the suffering they experience. According to the excerpt, individuals who are mindful, pure, and understanding will not be born again.\nBut what does it mean to not be born again? How is this different from the idea of heaven?\nHinduism and Buddhism both use the idea of reincarnation to explain the cycle of birth, life, and death. Both religions believe that individuals are trapped in this cycle by their own actions. This is the concept of karma.\nKarma is the idea that the circumstances of an individual's life, including their social class, are the result of that individual's actions in past lives. The nature of an individual's actions in a past life determines the nature of that individual's circumstances in the present life.\nFor example, if an individual in a past life performed actions that were harmful to others, that individual in the present life may be reborn into a life that is filled with suffering."}

But it does not need to be. In fact, many existentialists see their philosophy as a source of hope and inspiration.\nExistentialism teaches that we are not given a ready-made meaning to our lives. Instead, we must create our own meaning. This can be a daunting task, but it can also be liberating. If we are the ones who must create our own meaning, then we are also the ones who have the power to create a meaning. We do not need to accept a meaning that we do not find fulfilling.\nExistentialism also teaches that we are free. We do not need to accept the norms and expectations of our society. We have the freedom to choose our own norms and expectations. This can be a scary thought, but it can also be empowering. If we are free to choose our own norms and expectations, then we are also free to create a life that is fulfilling.\nSo, existentialism is a philosophy that can help us find hope and meaning in a world that can sometimes seem overwhelming.\nSOLUTION: The author of the passage is associated with existentialism. The passage is a reflection of existentialism's emphasis on the creation of meaning and the freedom of the individual."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nThe political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": ""}

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nFrom the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race."}, {"label": "B", "text": "should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake."}, {"label": "C", "text": "can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves."}, {"label": "D", "text": "was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": ""}

Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.

This happened often in the past when countries such as China, Japan, and India sought goods that were not available in their own countries. Europeans, who were importing these goods, found that they could trade European products for the things they wanted.\nSo, European merchants began to trade with the Chinese in the 1600s. The Chinese allowed this, but they made it clear that they did not want the trading to continue indefinitely. The Chinese government controlled the trade, and it seemed to be content to allow the trade to continue as long as it was in its favor.\nBy the 1750s, Europeans were trading with other Asia countries as well. The Dutch traded with the Japanese, and the British and French traded with the Indians. However, the Chinese remained wary of foreign traders.\nIn 1757, the Chinese emperor proclaimed that the Chinese would only trade with Europeans in a few specific cities. This made it difficult for European traders to sell their products.\nThe Chinese also increased tariffs, or taxes, on goods imported from Europe. This made European products more expensive in China.\nBy the mid-1800s, the Chinese had barred European traders from most of their country. They allowed only a few European nations to trade in a few specific cities. This was a major reason why trade between Europe and China slowed to a trickle."}

In addition, the people of many colonized territories have suffered the loss of their cultural heritage and traditional ways of life.\nDespite the human costs of colonialism, European nations continued to maintain their colonies for several centuries.

It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nWhat traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The traditional view of world history is that Europe was the first to create modern technology and that its society was the most powerful. This view asserts that China and the other Afro-Eurasian societies were either just as advanced as Europe or lagged behind in terms of technology and power.\nHowever, some historians are now challenging this traditional view. They argue that, throughout history, people in different parts of the world have each made their own unique contributions to technology and power. For example, the traditional view of world history suggests that the Chinese were not as technologically adept as Europeans. But this is not true. The Chinese were the first to use gunpowder for war, and they also developed many other important technologies."}

The work was hard, and the pay was low.\nThe factory owners did not want to improve the working conditions of their employees. They believed that the workers were fortunate to have any job at all, and that they should be grateful for the wages they received.\nBut some people believed that a worker's life should not be so difficult. They began to speak out against the factory owners. These people were called reformers.\nReformers helped create organizations to improve the lives of workers. For example, they helped create groups called labor unions. Labor unions gave workers a voice in the workplace. They also helped to improve wages and working conditions."}
