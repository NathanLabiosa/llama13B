The topic sentence is the first sentence of the paragraph. It tells the reader what the paragraph is about.\nWhen you write an essay, you need to figure out how to organize your ideas to best communicate what you know and what you want to tell your reader. One way to do this is by using topic sentences and topic paragraphs.\nA topic sentence is a sentence that tells the reader what a paragraph is about.\nA topic paragraph is a paragraph that is developed with topic sentences and topic sentences.\nWatch out for equivocation. Equivocation is when a word or phrase is used in a way that can make two or more sentences mean the same thing.\nFor example, the word create could be used to describe both the act of making something and the thing that is made.\nSo, if a sentence uses create to describe the act of making something, and the next sentence uses create to describe the thing that is made, then there is equivocation.\nThe sculpture created by the student is at the center of the exhibit.\nThe student created his sculpture over a period of several months.\nIn the first sentence, create is used to describe the act of making something.
