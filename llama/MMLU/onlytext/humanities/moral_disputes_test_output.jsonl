In On Liberty, Mill argued that a government can censor speech only if the speech is both false and harmful. This idea is part of Mill's theory of how to balance the rights of an individual with the rights of a society.\nAccording to Mill, censoring speech that is possibly true is a violation of human dignity. If the government can censor speech just because someone might find it offensive or uncomfortable, then the government is asserting that it is infallible. No government is infallible, and this idea goes against the principles of freedom of speech and human dignity.\nCensoring speech that is possibly true is a risk worth taking if the speech is dangerous enough. For example, if a speaker is falsely encouraging people to attack a group of people, then the speech is harmful. But censoring speech is a serious matter that should not be done lightly, and the speech must be objectively dangerous for censorship to be justified."}

Some people are motivated by a desire to help animals. They feel that animals have rights and that it is wrong to cause them harm. Other people are motivated by a desire to benefit humans. They believe that animals can be used to help humans, or that changing practices to protect animals will benefit humans in some way.\nWhether an animal is in need because of the animal's own species-typical behavior is not the ultimate explanation. Instead, the explanation lies in the wider effects of that behavior. For example, a animal's behavior to flee from a predator is not in itself bad, but that behavior can have wider effects that are bad. The behavior to flee can lead the animal to enter a house and can cause the animal or a human to get hurt."}

Retributivists argue that the main purpose of punishment is to right the scales of justice.\nThere are several types of retributivism. Nathanson supports the proportional type of retributivism. Proportional retributivists believe that the punishment should fit the crime. The punishment should be proportional to the crime in two ways. First, the severity of the punishment should match the severity of the crime. For example, a person who commits a minor crime should not be punished as severely as a person who commits a major crime. Second, the punishment should reflect the harm caused by the crime. For example, a person who causes severe harm should be punished more severely than a person who causes less harm.\nNathanson does not support the following types of retributivism.\nRetaliatory retributivists believe that the main purpose of punishment is to hurt the offender. This theory is based on the idea that the offender \"deserves\" to be hurt. But hurting the offender does not right the scales of justice. It only adds to the cycle of violence.\nPreventive retributivists believe that the main purpose of punishment is to prevent future crimes. While many people consider prevention to be an important part of the purpose of punishment, prevention is not the main purpose of punishment. A main purpose of punishment is to right the scales of justice for the harm that has already been done.\nEquality retributivists believe that the main purpose of punishment is to make the offender pay for the crime. But this theory does not take into account the harm caused by the crime. An offender who causes more harm should be punished more severely, regardless of whether the punishment is equal for all offenders.\nSOLUTION: Nathanson supports proportional retributivism. The passage explains that Nathanson believes the punishment should fit the crime. Nathanson does not support retaliatory, equality, or preventive retributivism."}

Consequentialist calculations are made by weighing the expected consequences of available options, and choosing the option with the best consequences.\nConsequentialist calculations can be flawed in various ways. One flaw is that they can run counter to a person's being able to integrate her commitments at various levels. For example, a lawyer's commitment to justice and a client's commitment to winning a case may come into conflict with each other.\nA second flaw is that consequentialist calculations can fail to recognize that persons are best understood in relation to one another. For example, a person may have obligations to family members or community that create duties to act for the sake of the group.\nA third flaw is that consequentialist calculations can run counter to the idea that persons are atomistic and individually rational actors. For example, a person may have social or political obligations that cannot be fulfilled by individual choice.\nAnother flaw is that it fails to reconcile prima facie duties. For example, a duty to sustain the earth's environment may come into conflict with a duty to produce as much as possible.\nSOLUTION: Hourdequin argues that one flaw of consequentialist calculation is that it can run counter to a person's being able to integrate her commitments at various levels. Consequentialist calculations can force a person to choose between her commitments, but a person may have obligations that cannot be fulfilled by individual choice."}

It is often necessary to make important decisions quickly in a crisis.\nThe second answer choice is incorrect. Important decisions often have objective answers.\nThe third answer choice is incorrect.

People are often free to leave a group they belong to.\nRules about settlement within a physical territory specify how people can use the land or resources of a territory. A territory is a piece of land or a resource.\nThere are different ways to settle questions about a territory. A territory can have a private owner. Or, a government can own and control a territory. An individual can own a piece of land. Or, a group of individuals can own a piece of land.\nFor example, a company is a type of group that has rules about membership.

They claim that when someone is treated as a sexual object, they are not viewed as a complex, vulnerable, and valuable person. Instead, they are seen in terms of their sexual appeal to others, which can reduce them to a mere object.\nSOLUTION: To treat someone as an object is sufficient for sexual objectification. This means that the objectification can begin if the person is treated as an object.\nHowever, to treat someone as an object is not necessary for sexual objectification. This means that, for sexual objectification to occur, the person does not have to be treated as an object in every situation."}

The question of whether they have direct moral standing is a more recent addition to the debate.\nThe concept of direct moral standing refers to whether a being is moral agent with rights. A moral agent is a being that can be held morally responsible for its choices.\nFor many years, the moral community has been understood to include only humans. Other beings are morally protected, but they do not have direct moral standing. This means that the moral community is not the same as the community of living beings.\nSOLUTION: The first answer choice is incorrect. It is not necessarily the case that the only beings that possess direct moral standing are human beings. A being does not have to be a human to have direct moral standing.\nThe third answer choice is incorrect. Ecosystems do not have the same interests as individual living beings.\nThe second answer choice is the correct answer. It is possible to argue that all and only sentient creatures have direct moral standing. But it is also possible to argue that humans have direct moral standing, even if some nonhuman animals are sentient."}

As Valls explains, there are several possible just causes for political violence:\nA just cause for political violence is usually defensive. People or groups may use violence to defend themselves against oppressive, tyrannical, or occupying forces.\nA just cause for political violence is usually offensive. People or groups may use violence to attack oppressive, tyrannical, or occupying forces.\nA just cause for political violence is usually territorial. People or groups may use violence to try to change borders or to defend their territory.\nA just cause for political violence is usually economically motivated. People or groups may use violence to fight for resources or to oppose economic policies that they believe are unfair.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether Valls sees a just cause for using violence against others, look at the words offensive and defensive. A just cause for political violence is usually offensive means that Valls believes using violence to attack others is not usually a just cause. So, Valls does not see a just cause for using violence against others."}

According to this idea, moral rules are not imposed by nature or by divine beings. Instead, they are established by human beings who want to live together.\nThe basic idea of social contract theories is that correct or justified moral rules or principles are the ones that result from an actual or hypothetical social agreement. This agreement is made among members of a society by whom the rules will be followed. The rules are agreed to because they are believed to be for the benefit of everyone in the society.\nBecause the agreement is made by the members of the society, the rules are considered valid by each member. This validation makes the rules binding on each member.\nSOLUTION: A social leader's moral deliberations do not constitute a social agreement. A social leader may impose moral rules on a society. But rules that are imposed are not part of a social agreement.\nA contract that has been signed by most of the affected parties is a social agreement. A contract is an agreement that is made among parties. The parties agree to the terms of the contract because they believe it is in their best interest.\nAn actual or hypothetical social agreement is an agreement that is made among members of a society.

Mental filters are thoughts or memories that distort how you see the world. They can make certain ideas or people seem more important than they really are.\nMental filters can cause you to overemphasize negative experiences with people from a certain group. For example, if you grew up with a critical parent, you might filter all other parents through the lens of your critical parent. This filter can make you overly critical of other parents.\nAnother type of mental filter is a worldview filter. This filter can affect how you see the world and what you pay attention to. For example, if you believe that people are either victims or villains, you might filter your experiences through this worldview. This filter can make you miss opportunities to understand complex situations.\nYou can overcome mental filters by recognizing that they exist. When you have a filter, you see the world in a distorted way. You can choose to go beyond your filter and consider other perspectives.\nSOLUTION: The disinvitation of certain speakers is an example of mental filtering. This solution is based on the idea that some speakers are no longer appropriate. But this is a distortion. It is a simple way to explain away the problem, but it is not fair to the speakers who have done good work."}

But wearing high heels is not wrong.\nSecond, there are harm arguments, which claim that something is wrong because it causes harm. But many things can cause harm. So, this argument is not helpful in deciding what is right or wrong.\nThird, there are divine command arguments, which claim that something is wrong because a god says it is wrong.

There are many different ways to define the best solution, and different people may have different ideas about what the best solution is. When the best solution involves making choices, it may be helpful to write down the criteria for making the choice.\nFor example, if you are trying to decide which college to attend, you may have criteria such as the cost of tuition, the distance from your home, and the quality of the college. For each criterion, you could assign a value or a weight to show how important it is to you. Then, you could compare each college to the criteria and assign a score to each college. The college with the highest score is the one that best meets your criteria.\nSome optimization problems have multiple criteria for what makes a solution optimal. For example, in a journey, you may want to choose the shortest route but also want to avoid going through any places with factories or power plants.\nIn general, the optimal solution is the one that meets the criteria in the best way. The best way to meet the criteria may depend on personal preferences and values.\nSOLUTION: Baxter believes that an overall maximally clean environment is the objective. An overall maximally clean environment is a state of zero pollution. This is the optimal solution because it best meets the criteria for an optimal state."}

According to this theory, war is sometimes morally necessary, but is usually a last resort after all peaceful alternatives have been exhausted.\nThe two main criteria for a just war, according to the just war theory, are that the cause is just and the means are proportional.\nThe cause is just when the intended target of the war is itself the cause of the conflict. For example, a war to defend against an invasion is considered a just cause.\nThe means are proportional when the benefits of the war are expected to outweigh the costs. Proportionality does not necessarily require a one-to-one correspondence between the costs and benefits of a war. Rather, the costs and benefits are weighed and considered in light of the goals of the war. For example, a war to free prisoners of war is proportionate if the benefits of freeing the prisoners outweigh the costs of the war.\nSome people believe that all wars are morally wrong. This view is called absolute pacifism.\nMoral nihilism is the view that there is no moral value in anything. This means that there are no moral values that can be used to evaluate wars or anything else.\nJus ad bellum is the body of laws that govern when it is permissible to go to war. The main criteria for jus ad bellum are that the war must be in self-defense, in defense of another country, or in pursuit of justice."}

For example, saving a child from drowning is not morally impermissible, but killing an innocent person is. So, an action does not have to be wrong in every situation to be morally impermissible."}

This type of argument asks you to believe that two things are similar in some way.\nMany claims about homosexuality are based on an analogy to race. These arguments claim that, just as a person is born with their race, a person is born with their sexual orientation. So, the argument goes, homosexuality is not a choice.\nThis analogy is often used to support the claim that homosexuality is good and natural. But the analogy is flawed.\nFirst, as much as we know about genetics, sexual orientation is not believed to be caused by a specific gene. This suggests that sexual orientation may not be an innate trait.\nSecond, race and sexual orientation are not the same. Race is a biological characteristic. Sexual orientation is not. So, the comparison is not apt."}

Many moral theories have been developed by philosophers. These theories try to identify what is right or wrong in a particular situation.\nConsequentialist approaches judge the morality of an action by its consequences. According to consequentialist theories, a action is right if it leads to good consequences, and a action is wrong if it leads to bad consequences.\nDeontological approaches judge the morality of an action by its rules or duties. According to deontological theories, a action is right if it follows the rules or duties, and a action is wrong if it breaks the rules or duties.\nVirtue ethics approaches judge the morality of an action by the character of the person who performs the action. According to virtue ethics theories, a action is right if the person who performs the action has the right character, and a action is wrong if the person who performs the action has the wrong character.\nAn ethics of prime facie duty approach is a type of deontological approach that focuses on the duties that come before an action. According to this approach, a action is right if it follows the duties that come before the action, and a action is wrong if it breaks the duties that come before the action.\nA Christian/Marxist approach is a type of consequentialist approach that focuses on the needs of a particular group. According to this approach, a action is right if it meets the needs of a particular group, and a action is wrong if it does not meet the needs of the group.\nSOLUTION: Hardin's approach to the moral issues of hunger and poverty is a consequentialist approach. According to this approach, a action is right if it leads to good consequences, and a action is wrong if it leads to bad consequences. Hardin believes that it is wrong to help people who are hungry or poor. He thinks that if we help these people, there will be more people who are hungry or poor. So, according to Hardin, it is wrong to help people who are hungry or poor."}

Some principles are:\nGreat ideas can come from anyone.\nCompanies that are open to new ideas are more likely to succeed.\nThe principle of maximizing happiness tells you that people should do whatever makes them happiest. This principle, alone, can tell you that people should be able to do whatever they want. But now consider an action that makes one person very happy but causes misery for others. Although that action may make the person happier, it does not make others happier. So, the principle of maximizing happiness cannot argue that this action is always the best choice.\nOn the other hand, the principle of minimizing suffering says that you should do what causes the least suffering. This principle does not necessarily tell you to always do what makes you happiest. For example, a painful but necessary surgery may cause suffering, but it may be necessary to minimize more suffering in the long run.\nSo, the principle of minimizing suffering is a better guide to a claim that seeks to resolve ethical issues.\nSOLUTION: The principle of minimizing suffering tells you that you should do what causes the least suffering.

He believes that individuals who do not contribute to a common resource will eventually be hurt by the resource's overuse or depletion. So, he argues, the government should coerce individuals into contributing to the resource.\nA Confucian approach to a collective action problem does not rely on coercion. Instead, it tries to change people's beliefs and attitudes about what is in their own interest.

The following types of considerations are important to keep in mind:\nI. Personal values: What we believe about what is important in life.\nII. Interpersonal values: What we believe about how people should treat each other.\nIII. Instrumental values: What we believe about the best ways to achieve our goals.\nIV. Political values: What we believe about the distribution of power and wealth in society.\nWhen you are considering an issue, it is important to figure out which of these types of considerations are relevant to the issue at hand.\nFor example, if you are deciding whether to buy a hybrid car, your personal values may be relevant. If you are concerned about environmental issues, you may want to buy a car that does not emit as much pollution. On the other hand, if you are concerned about the ability of our country to fight wars, you may be interested in the political values that are relevant to the production of cars.\nSOLUTION: Look at the text of the article.\nVelleman argues that euthanasia can be justified on the basis of Kantian considerations. According to Immanuel Kant, actions are morally right if they could be universalized, if everyone did this, then the world would be morally right. Velleman claims that euthanasia could be universalized: if everyone could assisted suicide, then the world would not be morally wrong.\nSo, Velleman's argument is a Kantian consideration. It is not a consequentialist consideration, because it does not depend on the effects of euthanasia. It is not a feminist consideration, because it does not depend on the experiences of women. It is not an existentialist consideration, because it does not depend on the nature of human existence."}

One influential theory of justice was developed by John Rawls. He argued that a just society is based on the following ideas:\nPeople have equal natural rights.\nInjustice can be traced to social institutions.\nSocial institutions are designed by people who are not yet born.\nThe principles of justice are the same for all societies.\nThe principles of justice for one society are also the principles of justice for other societies.\nThe burdens and benefits of social institutions are to be distributed equally.\nThese principles of justice apply to the basic structure of society, including its political, economic, and social institutions.\nThe basic structure of a society is just if it is designed to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged.\nIf different institutions satisfy the principles of justice, then the institutions that benefit the least advantaged are the most just.\nSOLUTION: To determine the justifiability of policies from the standpoint of the most well-off, you need to consider what is just. From the standpoint of the most well-off, the just policies are the ones that benefit the least advantaged. So, the policies are just if they benefit the least advantaged."}

For example, a member of a family has a moral obligation to contribute to the welfare of the family. A citizen of a society has a moral obligation to obey the laws of the society."}

The word euthanasia comes from a Greek word, which means \"good death.\"\nVoluntary euthanasia is when a patient or a patient's guardian requests that a physician assist in ending the patient's life.\nInvoluntary euthanasia is when a patient is unable to request to end their life, and a physician makes the decision to end the patient's life.\nPassive euthanasia is the act of not doing something, such as not treating a patient's condition or not providing food or water.\nActive euthanasia is the act of doing something to end a patient's life, such as administering a lethal injection.\nSOLUTION: Terri Schiavo's feeding tube was removed, and she was allowed to die of dehydration. This was not a case of voluntary euthanasia, because Terri did not request to die. Terri's case was not active euthanasia, because her feeding tube was not removed by a physician. Terri's case was passive euthanasia, because food and water were not provided to her."}

They would say that drug addiction is a problem that drug legalization cannot address. They might use the following argument:\nDrug addiction is a problem that is rooted in the nature of drugs. An addictive drug is a drug that keeps the body from working properly. When a person uses an addictive drug, the drug changes the brain in a way that can lead to addiction.\nSo, drug addiction is not autonomous. Autonomous means being self-governing. To be autonomous, a behavior must not be rooted in the nature of the world around us."}

Instead, the liberal state aims to protect the freedom of each person to pursue his or her own beliefs and lifestyle, as long as he or she does not harm others.\nA liberal state is based on the idea of individual liberty. Individual liberty is the freedom of each person to follow his or her own interests and values, as long as he or she does not harm others.

Singer argues that this principle can be applied to members of other species as well as to our own.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is Bentham. In An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, Bentham argued that the interests of each being should be equal to the interests of any human being. This idea is a step toward applying the principle of equal consideration to members of other species.\nThe other answer choice, Mill, came close to recognizing the equality of interests between humans and members of other species. In On Liberty, Mill argued that the principle of utility could be expanded to include animals. The principle of utility holds that the right thing to do is to maximize happiness or minimize suffering. If we expand the principle of utility to include animals, then we must weigh the interests of animals against our own interests. This is a step toward applying the principle of equal consideration of interests to members of other species.\nThe other answer choice, Kant, did not recognize that the principle of equal consideration of interests applies to members of other species.

The mentality of an animal is its set of beliefs, desires, and intentions. The physical existence of an animal is its body.\nSome philosophers have claimed that only beings with a certain type of mentality have a full moral standing. But this view leaves out at least some beings that seem to have a form of mentality.\nFor example, a dog has beliefs, desires, and intentions. A dog also has a form of mentality that is similar to our own. But a dog does not have a full moral standing. This view leaves out dogs and other animals that have a form of mentality.\nOther philosophers have claimed that only beings with a certain type of physical existence have a full moral standing. But this view leaves out beings that have a different type of physical existence.\nFor example, the view leaves out infants, who do not yet have the ability to live independently. But infants have a form of physical existence, and they have a right to life.\nSo, the argument from marginal cases claims that the type of mentality or physical existence that is necessary for a being to have a full moral standing is not known. This means that we cannot exclude animals and other beings from having a full moral standing based on their mentality or physical existence."}

According to Aquinas, moral rules are not simply human conventions, but have a deeper grounding in the nature of things. Aquinas believes that there is a way things are and a way things ought to be.\nTo determine the way things ought to be, one can look to the nature of human beings. Human beings have both a set of faculties and an end or purpose. Our faculties include things like our ability to reason and our sensory powers. Our end or purpose is to live a happy life.\nThese two things\u2014our faculties and our end or purpose\u2014together define a way of life that is appropriate for human beings. This way of life is what is meant by virtue. To act virtuously is to use our faculties in ways that promote our own flourishing and happiness.\nSo, Aquinas's view is that morality is ultimately grounded in facts about human nature. The other answers are not plausible for Aquinas. He does not think that morality is based on agreements, pleasure, or grace."}

But many states, including Alabama, used their own laws to restrict the freedom of African Americans. By the late 1800s, African Americans had lost many of the civil rights they had gained during Reconstruction.\nIn 1901, the state of Alabama, acting under the authority of the state constitution, elected in 1875, passed a law that required railroad companies to provide equal but separate accommodations for white and African-American passengers. The law became famous as the \"Separate Car Act.\"\nAfrican Americans and their allies challenged the Separate Car Act. They argued that it was based on the state's desire to restrict the freedom of African Americans. They also argued that the 14th Amendment, which was passed in 1868 and forbade states from denying any person \"equal protection of the laws,\" guaranteed African Americans the right to travel without being restricted by their race.\nSOLUTION: Wellman accepts that there are other values besides the freedom of association, such as egalitarian values concerning the elimination of inequalities that make people vulnerable to oppression.\nThe state of Alabama could not justify the Separate Car Act as an action to eliminate inequalities. The high court of Alabama, in 1904, decided that the Separate Car Act was not equal. It said that the act treated African-American and white passengers differently and that the differences were not based on any difference in the passengers.

You must decide what is important to you.\nIf you find that you desire a certain type of action, then that type of action is desirable for you."}

In the past, people were often denied this equality because of their nation, ethnicity, or race. Cosmopolitanism is the belief that these differences are not as important as the human differences that we all share.\nThe most common form of cosmopolitanism is moral cosmopolitanism, according to which those in a position to do so have an obligation to assist those in need because of poverty and to promote basic human rights.\nThe most common objection to moral cosmopolitanism is that it is too expensive. Nation-states can't afford to help everyone in need, and they have the right to decide how to spend their money.\nCosmopolitanism can also be based on other values. For example, some people think that every human has the right to live in a community that shares their language and culture. These people are cultural cosmopolitanists.\nOr, some people think that global inequality is not just a matter of individual rights but also of economic interests. They believe that global inequality is bad for everyone, including people in rich nations. Economic cosmopolitanists want to help poor nations develop, but they also want to make sure that the interests of rich nations are not harmed."}

He argued that a conservation system based wholly on economic motives is destined to fail.\nWhat is wrong with a conservation system based wholly on economic motives according to Leopold? It assumes that the economic parts of the biotic system will function without the uneconomic parts.\nMany of the services that nature provides are unscalable and unpriced. For example, the fertilization of waterways by nutrients from forests is an uneconomic service. When forests are cleared, the fertilization may continue, but it is no longer a service that can be valued in the market.\nThe value of a service is usually determined by its scarcity. So, when an uneconomic service becomes scarce, its value increases. For example, the ozone layer is a service that is both vital and scarce. The ozone layer is vital because it helps protect the biosphere. It is scarce because it is being destroyed.\nThe economic parts of an ecosystem provide services that are vital to the survival of nonhuman species. When these services are destroyed, the uneconomic parts of the ecosystem may become extinct."}

For example, the value of a person's life is intrinsic value. It is not the case that a person's life is valuable only because it is useful to other people.\nExtrinsic value is the value that something has, only because it is useful to someone. For example, the value of a dollar bill is extrinsic value. A dollar bill is valuable only because it can be exchanged for goods and services.\nThe doctrine of double effect says that an action that has both an intrinsic value and an extrinsic value can be morally permissible. This is called an action with a double effect.\nFor example, taking care of a sick person is intrinsically valuable. It is also extrinsically valuable, because it is useful to the sick person. So, a person can be justified in taking care of a sick person. However, a person is not justified in taking care of a sick person only because taking care of a sick person is useful to the person. This would make the action's extrinsic value the reason for the action's value.\nSOLUTION: To say that an action is intrinsically permissible is to say that the action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible. This means that the action is not intrinsically valuable. It is not the case that the action is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable.\nThe other answer choices are not correct.\nNo actual person would ever endorse that action means that the action is not intrinsically valuable. It is not the case that the action is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable.\nThe action, only because of its effects, is morally permissible means that the action is intrinsically valuable. It is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable.\nThe action is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable means that the action is intrinsically valuable.

For example, the Constitution says that the government cannot maintain a standing army (a professional army) during times of peace. This means that the government cannot have an army ready to fight at a moment's notice.\nAs originally written, the Constitution did not put any limits on the ability of the government to raise and support an army.

One question they are debating is what makes a punishment just. Two theories have been discussed.\nRetribution is the idea that a person who commits a crime deserves to be punished. Punishment is supposed to be equal to the offense.\nRetributive justice is based on the idea that people have free will and are responsible for their choices. When a person makes a choice to commit a crime, they decide to break the rules of the society. The society has the right to punish that person. The punishment should be equal to the offense.\nEquality retributivism is a theory of punishment that suggests the punishment should be equal to the offense. This theory is based on the idea that people have free will and are responsible for their choices.\nEquality retributivism can be used to answer the question of what makes a punishment just. A just punishment is equal to the offense. The punishment should be appropriate to the crime.\nAn eye for an eye is an example of an eye equality retributivism. This theory suggests that the punishment should be equal to the offense. If a person harms another person, that person should be harmed in return.\nMany people find the idea of eye-for-an-eye justice attractive. But it is also criticized. Some people think that it is too punitive. A punishment is too punitive if it is so harsh that it becomes cruel and unusual.\nA consequentalist theory of punishment is the idea that the punishment should be equal to the harm caused. This theory suggests that the purpose of punishment is to prevent future crimes. The punishment should be equal to the harm caused by the crime.\nA consequentalist theory can be used to answer the question of what makes a punishment just. A just punishment is equal to the harm caused. The punishment should prevent future crimes.\nA police officer writes a ticket for a driver who goes 50 miles per hour in a 30 miles per hour zone. The driver pays a fine. The punishment is equal to the harm caused by the driver's actions. The driver was going too fast, but the driver did not cause any harm. The punishment is not too punitive.\nSOLUTION: Nathanson believes that killing another person in self-defense is compatible with respect for the dignity of persons. This shows that Nathanson believes that a person has the right to defend themselves. A person has the right to defend themselves against an attacker. Killing an attacker in self-defense is not punishment. It is an act of self-defense."}

This idea can be found in many ancient legal systems and is also referred to as an eye for an eye.\nProportional retributivism is a theory of punishment that states that the severity of a punishment should be proportional to the severity of a crime. This principle is similar to lex talionis.\nThe morality of restraint is a principle that states that the use of force is justified only in retaliation for force that has been used against you. This principle is different from lex talionis, which allows for the use of force to be repaid with force.\nThe death penalty is the legally sanctioned killing of a person who has been convicted of a capital offense.

This principle comes into conflict with the moral principle of doing what is best for others when you try to decide whether to help an addict cope with his addiction. Respecting the dignity of the addict tells you that you ought to help him. Doing what is best for him tells you that you ought to help him break his addiction.\nSOLUTION: Nagel says that there can be moral dilemmas because sometimes two or more moral principles come into conflict.

This type of justice involves two ideas: proportionality and degradation.\nProportionality: The punishment should be in proportion to the harm caused by the wrongdoing. For example, if a person accidentally breaks a $100 vase, a $1,000 fine is not proportionally appropriate.\nDegradation: The punishment should be degrading. This idea is based on the notion that a person who does wrong should be made to feel bad. A punishment that is too degrading is not proportionally appropriate. A person who breaks a $100 vase should not be fined $1,000.\nRestorative justice is the idea that the punishment should fit the wrongdoing. This type of justice involves three ideas: restoration, compensation, and deterrence.\nRestoration: The punishment should aim to fix the harm done. A person who vandalizes a building should be required to help pay for the repairs.\nCompensation: The punishment should compensate the victim for the harm done. For example, a person who embezzles money from a client should be required to compensate the client for the stolen funds.\nDeterrence: The punishment should discourage others from doing wrong. A person who drives under the influence of alcohol should be punished to discourage others from doing the same thing.\nSOLUTION: To determine if a punishment is justified, compare the punishment to the two types of justice.\nHarmful punishment that is proportionate to the harm done by the wrongdoing. is a retributive punishment. It is proportionate to the harm done.\nUnfriendly action that is proportionate to the unfriendly wrongdoing, aimed at correcting the wrongdoing. is a restorative punishment. It aims to correct the harm done.\nDegradation proportionate to the degrading impacts of the wrongdoing. is a retributive punishment. It is proportionate to the harm done.\nAll of the above. is the correct answer. The proposed punishment is proportionate to the harm done. It is also aimed at correcting the wrongdoing."}

These rules can have a major impact on the use and distribution of resources.\nProperty rights can have both conventional and unlimited forms. Conventional property rights limit what you can do with a resource. For example, private property rights limit you to the use of the resource in a way that does not harm others.\nUnlimited property rights allow you to do anything you want with a resource, as long as you can get away with it. There are no conventional property rights to stop you.\nInsisting on unlimited property rights commits one to anarchy, as there would be no rules to limit the worst behavior of property owners.\nProperty rights can also have a fee simple or leCTURE: Initial ownership of a resource determines the type of property right.\nA fee simple is the most common type of property right.

Utilitarianism suggests that we should act so as to produce the greatest amount of happiness. This disregards the fact that some actions are worth doing even though they do not produce the greatest amount of happiness. For example, a person who enjoys playing the piano might decide to play every day, even though that action does not produce the greatest amount of happiness. This person enjoys playing the piano, and that enjoyment is a reason to play every day.\nAnother critique of utilitarianism is that it is not clear how one could determine the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. How, for example, would one decide which types of happiness are equal? If one person enjoys reading and another person enjoys watching television, how can one decide which type of happiness is \"greater\"?\nSome utilitarians have attempted to address these critiques. For example, they have suggested that the greatest amount of happiness is not the only reason to act. They also argue that the personal character of duty can be a reason to act. They claim that one should act in the way that promotes the greatest amount of happiness, but also in the way that does not treat people as mere means to an end.\nHowever, these responses have not resolved the issues with utilitarianism. For example, the idea that the personal character of duty can be a reason to act implies that there are other reasons to act that utilitarianism does not consider. This implies that utilitarianism is not the best theory of ethics."}

This belief can lead to policies of exclusion, which are based on the idea that some cultures are better than others. But how can you determine if one culture is truly superior to another?\nOne way to do this is to compare the cultures on a single dimension and decide which one is better. For example, you could compare the cultures on a dimension such as wealth. If one culture has more wealth, then that culture might be considered superior.\nHowever, it is not that simple. Different cultures place different values on things like wealth. For example, among the indigenous people of Paraguay, living in a small village with little money but close family ties and a connection to the land is considered superior to living in a big city with a high standard of living but little sense of community.\nSo, superiority and inferiority are inherently subjective concepts.

Care ethics is a response to what care ethicists see as the limitations of traditional ethical theories, such as consequentialism and deontology.\nCare ethics begins with the idea that the moral life is characterized by caring relationships. Caring for others is central to being moral. Care ethics is best understood in contrast to the ethics of justice. Justice-based ethical theories see the moral life as centered on the distribution of rights and the enforcement of duties. In the context of the family, for example, justice-based ethical theories would demand that children be responsible for their siblings and that parents treat their children equally. Care ethics, in contrast, sees the moral life as centered on the needs of individuals and the responsibilities of others to meet those needs. In the context of the family, care ethics would argue that siblings should help each other and that parents should provide for the needs of their children, even if that means treating children differently.\nCollins argues that caring attitudes are not moral attitudes at all.

The embryo is carried inside the mother's womb, or uterus.\nDuring the eighth week, the embryo is called a fetus. The word fetus is also used to describe an unborn animal in the womb.\nSOLUTION: An embryo is an unborn vertebrate animal that has developed to the point of having the basic structure that is characteristic of its kind.\nAn embryo has the basic structure of a human. It has all the body parts that a person will have. But the embryo is not yet fully formed. It is still growing and developing."}

Killing is the direct and purposeful act of ending a person's life. Letting die is the act of not doing something to prevent a person's death, when you could have done something to prevent it.\nBoth killing and letting die are considered morally equivalent. This means that, from an ethical standpoint, they are just as wrong. As a result, you are equally to blame for killing or letting die.\nSOLUTION: The last paragraph tells you that the killing/letting die distinction is morally relevant. The more direct and purposeful the act, the more likely it is to be morally wrong. The distinction between killing and letting die is not about the outcome, but about the actions that lead to the outcome.\nFor example, killing someone by sending poisoned food is a more direct and purposeful act than withholding medicine that they need to survive. So, killing by sending poisoned food is a worse act than withholding medicine."}

If you can refute the counterargument, you'll weaken your original argument.\nSinger's argument is vulnerable to the following counterargument:\nOur emotional reactions can be irrational. We can be moved by a persuasive speaker or an emotionally manipulative advertisement. Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that our emotional reactions have no bearing on which moral claims are true.\nSinger could respond to this counterargument by admitting that emotional reactions can be irrational and yet argue that they are still an important aspect of decision-making.

A just society is a society that is arranged to be fair and to avoid harm to those who are worse off.\nRawls's theory of justice is based on the following two principles of justice:\n1. The principle of equal basic liberties: Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberties compatible with a similar liberty for others.\n2. The difference principle: Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged and attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.\nIn an unjust society, some people have more opportunities than others simply by virtue of their birth. This is an injustice.\nIn an unjust society, some people have more goods than others. This is an injustice.\nIn an unjust society, liberty is restricted to those who have not earned it.

According to this principle, people have a moral obligation to help those who are suffering from hunger and poverty, but only if they are able to help and if they desire to help. This principle claims that people are not morally responsible for helping when they cannot afford to do so, or when they do not want to help."}

These obligations arise from our relationships to other citizens, and they are based on the idea that we all have an interest in a just and stable society.\nCitizens have both rights and obligations. Our rights include freedom of speech, voting, and due process of law. Our obligations include respecting the rights of others and obeying the law.\nWhen we break these obligations, we may be subject to penalties. For example, we may be fined or imprisoned for committing a crime. But the point of these obligations is not to enable the government to penalize us.

For example, the basic value of survival is built into the fact that those who survive are able to reproduce. The basic value of reproduction is built into the fact that those who reproduce pass their genes on to the next generation.\nThese basic values are not just human values. They are built into the nature of things. So, the basic principle of natural law theory tells you that an action is right if it is of a type that helps an organism survive and reproduce.\nSOLUTION: The action of using a non-renewable energy source is not of a type that the laws of natural selection have favored. Our ancestors did not use non-renewable energy sources. They did not have the technology to extract non-renewable energy sources from the ground.\nThe action of using a renewable energy source is of a type that the laws of natural selection have favored.

In the United States, free speech includes not only the ability to speak or write, but also the right to be heard and to have a willing audience. The concept of free speech also includes the protection of new forms of expression and communication that arise out of advancing technology.\nSpeech that is intended to harm others is not protected by the First Amendment. The harm caused by speech can take different forms.\nCausal harm is the harm that is a direct result of speech. For example, a speaker who yells \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater causes harm by posing a direct threat to the theater-goers' safety.\nExpressive harm is the harm that is caused by the content of speech. For example, a speaker who addresses a crowd and incites violence causes harm to the members of the audience who are later beaten by a mob.\nAuxiliary harm is the harm that is caused by the fact that speech is happening at all. For example, a speaker who shouts above a deafening crowd is not causing harm to the hearing of others.\nThe First Amendment does not protect speech that causes harm. But the lines between the different types of harm can be blurry. For example, the harm caused by a speaker yelling \"Fire!\" in a theater is causal harm.

Many people believed that these actions were wrong, but they were consistent with the official policy.\nToday, the United States government states that all people have the right to choose their leaders and to make decisions about how to run their countries. The United States also believes that it is wrong for one country to try to take over another country.\nThese ideas are part of a set of principles called democracy. A government that is chosen by the people is more likely to be responsive to the needs of the people. And a country that can make its own decisions is more likely to be in control of its own fate.\nSOLUTION: Wellman cites a number of \"unpalatable implications that follow from denying a country's right to freedom of association,\" including the inability to explain why it would be wrong to force Canada to join NAFTA.\nThis shows that the right of freedom of association is important. It is a human right to be able to come together and associate with other individuals who share common interests."}

{"question": " According to Kant, an imperative that represents an action as a necessary means to something that is willed is what kind of imperative?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "categorical"}, {"label": "B", "text": "universalizable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hypothetical"}, {"label": "D", "text": "noumenal"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: According to Kant, there are four ways to form an imperative from a moral principle. A moral principle is a principle that prescribes a course of action as a necessary means to achieving a valued end.\nThe first way is to make an imperative that is categorical. A categorical imperative is an imperative that represents an action as a necessary means to achieving a valued end. It does not matter that the end is valued. Categorical imperatives are universally valid.\nThe second way is to make an imperative that is hypothetical. A hypothetical imperative is an imperative that represents an action as a necessary means to achieving a particular end. Hypothetical imperatives are valid only for specific persons or situations.\nThe third way is to make an imperative that is universalizable. An imperative is universalizable if its contents can be applied universally, without violating the rights of other persons. If an imperative is universalizable, it is a moral imperative.\nThe fourth way is to make an imperative that is noumenal. An imperative is noumenal if it prescribes an action that is necessary for achieving a valued end, but the means of achieving that end are not specified. Noumenal imperatives are not universally valid.\nSOLUTION: To determine the type of an imperative, try to determine what the agent means by the principle from which the imperative is formed.\nConsider the principle that an action is a necessary means to a valued end. This principle generates an imperative that is categorical. The imperative commands an agent to do an action if the agent wants to achieve a valued end.\nThis imperative is categorical because it does not depend on the agent's particular circumstances. An agent who wants to achieve a valued end should do the action that is necessary to achieve that end."}

When designing an experiment, you must identify the parts of the experiment that will be tested and the parts that will be measured during the experiment. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what to test and what to measure during your experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must test different types of soil.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick."}

They may decide not to let anyone see certain books, articles, movies, or TV shows. But, in order to protect people, censors must first decide what is bad for them. This can be difficult! Some things are not bad for people, but are inappropriate for some people. For example, an action movie with a lot of shooting and explosions is not bad for most people, but it may not be appropriate for young children.\nSome things are not bad for people, but are illegal. For example, theft is not bad for people, but it is illegal.\nSome things are bad for people. For example, smoking is bad for people.\nHow do censors decide whether something is bad? They may look at the content of the material to decide if it is inappropriate, illegal, or harmful.\nSome content is bad because it is inappropriate for certain people. For example, a movie with a lot of sexual content is not bad for most people, but it may be inappropriate for young children.\nSome content is bad because it is illegal. For example, a movie that advocates violence is illegal.\nSome content is bad because it is harmful. For example, a book that advocates hate is harmful.\nSOLUTION: Mill argues that even a false opinion should not be censored because you don't really know whether or not anything is false. If a person is not able to explain why a false view is false, then that person may believe the false view is true. This is not good. But, if a person is able to explain why a false view is false, then that person does know the true view."}

Try to make sure that your actions will not harm others, and that they will help others when possible.\nBe consistent. Try to act in accordance with your values. This can help you avoid being forced to make choices that make you unhappy or that go against your principles.\nSOLUTION: To decide if Norcross's claim is true, consider the following questions:\nDoes morality demand that we not support factory farming?\nDoes morality demand that we not torture puppies merely to enhance our own eating pleasure?\nDoes morality demand that we try to reduce our carbon footprint?\nDoes morality demand that we donate money to Oxfam?\nThe answer is C.

These errors can lead to mental health problems and maladaptive behaviors.\nFortune-telling involves believing that you know what the future holds. This can be the result of ignoring the present or overemphasizing a few details.\nBlaming involves looking for someone or something to blame for a problem. This can make a person feel like a victim or feel like they have power by blaming someone else.\nDichotomous thinking involves thinking in terms of either/or, when both/and may be more accurate. For example, thinking of yourself only as a good guy or a bad guy, instead of acknowledging your own strengths and weaknesses.\nOvergeneralization involves drawing an overly broad conclusion based on a single event. This can lead to feelings of hopelessness.\nMental filter involves focusing on the bad aspects of a situation and filtering out the positive. This can lead to feelings of hopelessness.\nPersonalization involves believing that everything is about you. This can make a person feel like they have no control over their life and can lead to feelings of helplessness.\nPolarized thinking involves seeing only extreme choices. This can make a person feel like they have to choose between two very different choices, when there may be a middle ground.\nSOLUTION: Trigger warnings involve dichotomous thinking, or thinking in terms of either/or.

Global justice is a matter of determining what is just for a group of people who are distinct by virtue of their being part of a global society.\nSOLUTION: Look at the following passage from Carens, and decide which answer choice best matches his position.\n\"I defend a form of libertarianism that is strongly cosmopolitan. I call this view 'cosmopolitanism,' but it is also influenced by the libertarian tradition. I believe that states should be justified by reference to the general interest of the global population. This general interest is constituted by the interests of all individuals affected by the state's policies. These individuals are not only the citizens of the state in question, but also others who are affected by the state's policies, including foreigners whose lives are affected by the state's military or economic actions.\nI do not believe that states have the right to exist simply by virtue of their existing. I believe that states are justified by the good they do for the people they serve. If a state does not serve the general interest of the global population, then it is not justified. If it serves the general interest only in part, then it is only partially justified. It is not enough for a state to have good policies. It also must be doing good overall.\nMoreover, I believe that states should be judged by how well they promote the general interest of the global population. The most well-off people in the world today have a greater responsibility to serve the general interest of the global population than do people who are less well-off. This is because the most well-off people are responsible for many of the problems that affect the global population. For example, they are responsible for many of the world's environmental problems, including climate change.\nI do not believe that states should be judged by how well they promote the interests of their own citizens. Citizens and non-citizens have equal moral worth. Therefore, citizenship should not be a relevant consideration in evaluating states.\nFinally, I do not believe that states should be judged by how well they promote the interests of their own rulers. Rulers and ruled have equal moral worth. Therefore, the interests of rulers should not be a relevant consideration in evaluating states.\nTo sum up, I am not defending a form of cosmopolitanism, or a form of libertarianism. I am defending a form of libertarian cosmopolitanism: an overall perspective that combines the libertarian tradition with a strong commitment to the global distribution of justice.\""}
