Some philosophers believe that there is a specific set of rules or principles that applies universally to all people. They call these rules or principles ethical principles.\nAn ethical principle is a rule or principle that specifies what is right or wrong. An ethical principle can help you decide what to do in a variety of situations.\nSome ethical principles are based on the interests of the people involved. For example, the principle of beneficence, or doing good, says that you should do good to other people. The principle of nonmaleficence, or not causing harm, says that you should not cause harm to other people.\nOther ethical principles are based on the nature of the actions themselves. For example, the principle of autonomy, or self-rule, says that people should be allowed to make decisions about their own lives. The principle of justice, or fairness, says that people should be treated fairly.\nSOLUTION: According to Gauthier, the basis of morality is maximizing the utility of all sentient beings. This means that an action is right if it tends to maximize the well-being of all affected beings."}

But sometimes it is possible to make words out of individual letters. When this happens, the letters are called subwords.\nTwo subwords are distinct if no part of one is identical to any part of the other.\nFor example, the subwords me and we are distinct. The middle of me is not the same as the we.\nOn the other hand, the subwords mom and mop are not distinct. The m of mop is the same as the m of mom.\nA word is imaginary if it is not spelled with letters.\nFor example, the word color is imaginary. It is spelled with letters, but it is not made up of letters.\nSOLUTION: The existence of existing and perceiving is not in question. They are not imaginary.\nNeither existing nor perceiving is nonexistent. You can perceive things, and existing things can be perceived.\nExisting and perceiving are not the same thing. They are distinct things. You can exist without perceiving, and you can perceive without existing."}

Some traditional distinctions have become outdated and are no longer considered valid.\nUtilitarianism is an ethical theory that assesses the rightness or wrongness of an action by its usefulness in maximizing overall happiness. Utilitarianism is a form of teleological ethics, which is an ethical theory that focuses on the consequences of actions.\nDeontological ethics is an ethical theory that focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of an action. Deontological ethics is often called \"duty ethics,\" because the theory holds that an action is inherently right if it fulfills a moral duty.\nThe table below shows the differences between deontological and utilitarian ethics:\n\n| Deontological Ethics | Utilitarian Ethics |\n| \u2022 Focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of an action. | \u2022 Focuses on the consequences of an action. |\n| \u2022 \"Duty\" ethics. An action is inherently right if it fulfills a moral duty. | \u2022 \"Consequences\" ethics. An action is inherently right if its consequences are the best possible. |\n| \u2022 Moral rules are absolute. | \u2022 Moral rules are not absolute. The greater good is what matters. |\n| \u2022 Examples: Killing is always wrong. Honesty is always the best policy. | \u2022 Examples: SOLUTION: Singer's argument that people have a moral obligation to give to charity, even if it means giving up a large sum of money, upsets the traditional distinction between duty and charity. Traditionally, duty and charity have been considered two different ethical concepts. Duty refers to what a person is required to do, while charity refers to what a person is allowed to do. Singer's argument shows that these two concepts are not as separate as many people think."}

When someone makes an argument, they make a claim and offer evidence and reasons to support the claim. Arguments can be used to prove a claim, to show that a claim is true, or to show that a claim is more likely to be true than alternative claims.\nThe following types of arguments are used in philosophy:\nInductive arguments: Inductive arguments present evidence and reasons that support a claim. Inductive arguments can show that a claim is true, but they can't prove a claim.\nDeductive arguments: Deductive arguments present evidence and reasons that support a claim. Deductive arguments can prove a claim, but they can't show that a claim is true.\nSOLUTION: Philosophy is concerned with identifying beliefs about human existence and evaluating arguments that support those beliefs.

For Epicurus, natural law includes common sense, the principles of justice, and the obligations of reciprocity.\nAccording to Epicurus, a law is not in accordance with the traditions of society when it goes against the customs and cultures of a community. For Epicurus, customs and cultures are part of nature, and they can provide guidance on what is just.\nEpicurus did not believe that divine law exists. For him, the gods are not involved in human affairs, and just as humans do not punish dogs for eating meat, the gods do not punish humans for similar behavior.\nAccording to Epicurus, a law is not beneficial to those it affects when it creates fear and anxiety.

According to utilitarianism, the moral saint\u2014the person who does the most good\u2014is the person who does the most to make other people happy.\nDeontological ethics is a different theory of ethics. Deontological ethics says that the right thing to do is the thing that follows from our duties and the rights of other people. According to deontological ethics, the moral saint is the person who is most responsible and who most respects the rights of other people.\nBoth utilitarianism and deontological ethics are influential theories of ethics. But they are not the only theories. Other theories include virtue ethics, which focuses on the character of the moral agent, and social contract theory, which focuses on the agreements and obligations that people have with each other.\nSOLUTION: Wolf's argument gives us reason to abandon utilitarianism, but it does not give us reason to abandon deontological ethics. According to Wolf's argument, the unattractiveness of the moral saint\u2014the person who does the most good\u2014is that this person is always unhappy. But being unhappy is not a duty.

These forms are only accessible to the human mind by way of the intellect. To Plato, the world of forms is the realm of eternal truth.\nThe forms are not objects that can be touched or seen. They are ideal versions of objects or concepts that are perfect and unchanging. The form of a chair, for example, is the perfect, eternal version of a chair. This form does not have size, shape, or color. It is perfect.\nEvery object or concept in the world is a copy, or imitation, of its corresponding form. A chair in the real world is a copy of the form of a chair.\nBecause the forms are perfect, any object or concept in the world is imperfect and incomplete. For example, a chair in the real world is made of wood. It is also large and brown. But the form of a chair is not made of anything. It is also not large or brown.\nSOLUTION: Plato's suggestion that knowledge is innate or remembered as a result of being triggered by experience is in response to a paradox he sets up for himself. The paradox, now referred to as Meno's Paradox, has to do with the question of how a person can remember anything about the realm of the Forms after the shock of being born into this world.\nPlato's response is that the soul has access to the realm of the forms before it is born into the world. This is why we are able to recognize the forms."}

Moral luck is a philosophical issue that concerns the problem of moral responsibility connected to the problem of luck.\nMoral luck is the idea that people can be morally responsible for things that are outside of their control. Here is one way to think about the problem of moral luck:\nImagine that you are driving your car, and you run a red light. You have a car accident, and the driver of the other car dies. You were not planning to kill anyone, but you were not able to avoid the accident. Were you morally responsible for the death?\nMoral luck claims that your answer to this question depends on how the accident happened. If the accident was caused by your driving too fast for the conditions, you were morally responsible for the death. But if the accident was caused by a sudden medical condition, you were not morally responsible for the death.\nSOLUTION: Nagel claims that the problem of moral luck is closely connected to the problem of the existence of God. If God is responsible for all events, then a person's moral character is determined by how they respond to what is outside of their control. This means that a person's moral character is not a product of their own choices. This is a form of moral luck."}

If a rule does not meet one of these conditions, it is not a genuine moral rule.\nFor example, a rule that is not based on the group's moral values is not a genuine moral rule. A rule that is not recognized by the group is not a genuine moral rule.\nIf an action is forbidden by a non-genuine moral rule, then the action is not forbidden by a moral rule of the group.

He found that he could doubt practically everything. He could doubt his own existence: After all, sometimes we can doubt that we are awake or that we are not dreaming. He could doubt the existence of the external world: Maybe he was trapped in a virtual reality.\nBut Descartes could find no way to doubt the cogito, or the idea that he is thinking. So, he reasoned that he must exist. If he is thinking, then he is. If he is, then something must be thinking. It is wrong to say that he is thinking without there being something to do the thinking. So, he has found a truth beyond a doubt: he exists as a thinking thing."}

A good is something that satisfies our desire for something we think is worthwhile. A desire is a want or a need that we have. We can want other people to be happy, or we can want to be happy ourselves. A pleasure is a delight in an event or thing that happens to us. Aquinas believed that we can sometimes confuse pleasure with the good that we desire. For example, we may think that a pleasure is a good, but it is not. We can enjoy a delicious meal, but the pleasure of eating is not the same as the good that we desire, which is nourishment.\nSOLUTION: Look at the underlined parts of the argument. The text argues that the end of every action is some good. A good is something that satisfies our desire for something we think is worthwhile. So, the end of every action is some desire."}

He argues that the wealthy nations have a moral responsibility to assist the extremely poor because they have the financial resources to do so.\nSOLUTION: Parfit's argument involves a different moral issue: the principle of equal consideration of identical copies. This principle states that if all the parts of a being are identical, then any counterpart of that being exists in the same circumstances must have the same interests.\nFor example, if a person is cloned, the clone is a different person from the original. But if the original and the clone are identical, they must have the same interests. If the original person is injured, the clone is also injured.\nUsing this principle, Taurek's assumption that all pain be caused by a single source is incorrect. If each of the six billion people on Earth suffers a small amount of pain, that is a total of six billion times the amount of pain. But by the principle of equal consideration of identical copies, each of those six billion people is an identical copy of every other person. So, the principal of equal consideration of identical copies tells us that the total amount of pain suffered is the same, regardless of how it is distributed.\nEach person has one life. So, the fact that a person's life is divided into many years, each of which is lived one at a time, does not mean that the person suffers a small amount of pain for each year. Instead, the person suffers a small amount of pain for each year of their life, but the total amount of pain is the same as the person's life.\nLewis's assumption that all pain be felt by a single person is incorrect. For example, the pain of a cloned person is felt by the clone. But by the principle of equal consideration of identical copies, the original person and the clone are identical. So, the original person also feels the pain.\nTaurek's assumption that all pain be felt at a single time is incorrect. For example, a person who suffers a small amount of pain each year suffers a total of six billion times the amount of pain in a lifetime."}

One way to help you make a decision is to use a set of principles to determine which action is the most moral. Some people find that the following principles help them decide what is right and wrong:\nTreat others as you would like to be treated. This is sometimes called the Golden Rule.\nDo not harm other people.\nBe responsible for your actions.\nThese principles can help you decide what is right and wrong in many situations. For example, if you are facing a decision about whether to lie, the principles above might help you decide not to lie. According to the Golden Rule, you would not want to be lied to, so you should not lie to others. Also, according to the principle of not harming other people, lying can harm people's trust in you. And according to the principle of being responsible for your actions, you should take responsibility for your actions and be honest."}

In this part, Hume explores the origins of our moral principles and argues that they derive from custom and the needs of society.\nHume begins with the observation that humans are social animals who depend on society for survival. Because we are interdependent, we have a common interest in cooperating with one another. To determine the right way to behave towards others, we consider what is useful to the society and what is useful to the individual.\nHume claims that justice has value in part because it is useful to society. To behave justly means to avoid harming others and to fulfill your promises. Cooperation and trust, which are made possible by the practice of justice, make social life possible.\nJustice also has value solely because it is useful to the agent. By behaving justly, an individual can gain the respect and trust of others, which can make it easier to cooperate with them."}

The following figures in ethical theory help to explain some of the key questions and answers in ethics:\nImmanuel Kant: How should we live?\nKant's answer: We should live in accordance with the moral law, which is the principle of the Categorical Imperative. The moral law is based on the concept of duty, and it tells you to treat people as ends, not means.\nJohn Stuart Mill: How should we live?\nMill's answer: We should live in accordance with the principle of utility. The principle of utility tells you to do what will produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\nAristotle: How should we live?\nAristotle's answer: We should live in accordance with virtue. To do this, you must find the right balance among the virtues, which include courage, fairness, friendliness, and wisdom.\nJean-Paul Sartre: Does life have a meaning?\nSOLUTION: According to Moore, the most fundamental question in all of ethics is whether morality is objective. This means that he believes the most important question in ethics is whether there are absolute rights and wrongs, or if what is right and wrong depends on what people think, want, or need."}

An action is wrong if it produces pain and unhappiness for anyone.\nSOLUTION: Bentham claims that actions are right or wrong in virtue of their consequences. This means that the motives behind an action are not as important as the action's consequences in determining right and wrong."}

His groundbreaking work in ethics laid the foundation for the field of deontology. Deontology is an ethical theory that focuses on the inherent right and wrong of actions, regardless of their consequences.\nAccording to Kant, the moral worth of an action depends on the moral character of the agent who performs it. For an action to be morally right, the maxim of the action must be a good and universal law. A good maxim is an action rule that anyone can follow, without contradiction, and that is consistent with the moral laws that govern the world.\nA action is universally lawful when it can be followed by everyone without requiring a contradiction. For example, the maxim for an action is universally lawful if everyone can follow the maxim without requiring a contradiction.\nThe moral worth of an action does not depend on the consequences of the action. A action can have good consequences, bad consequences, or mixed consequences. But that does not determine the moral worth of the action."}

For example, a moral rule that maximizes positive utility, ignoring negative utility, would not be ideal. Forcing people to donate money to help the poor would maximize positive utility, but it would trample on the right to own property. And a moral rule that takes no account of either positive or negative utility would not be ideal. A moral rule that tells you to jump off a bridge would fail to promote the well-being of people who follow it."}

A decision is deliberatively justified if and only if the agent can engage in a rational discussion with the observer about why the decision is better than other available options.\nOne objection to deliberative justification is that it is incomplete. This objection claims that there are some relevant considerations that are not covered by the deliberative justification criteria. For example, suppose that the observer asks the agent about the impact of the decision on other people. To be deliberatively justified, the decision cannot depend on its effects on other people. But this means that a decision that benefits others cannot be deliberatively justified, since it is not better than other available options as measured by the deliberative criteria.\nGauthier responds to this objection by expanding the definition of deliberative justification. According to Gauthier, a decision is deliberatively justified if and only if the agent can justify it in a rational discussion that includes all the relevant considerations. So, a decision can be deliberatively justified if it is better than other available options when all relevant considerations are taken into account."}

An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nThe instructions in an organism's genes influence the structure of the organism's parts. For example, a gene may specify the structure of an animal's limbs or the structure of a plant's leaves.\nAn organism's genes also affect which substances its body makes. For example, a gene may specify the structure of a plant's cells or the structure of an animal's enzymes.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits because they provide the instructions that the organism's cells use to build the parts of its body.\nSOLUTION: One way to determine if an organism has an intelligence is to look at the structure of the organism's parts.\nA watch has many parts that work together to tell time.

According to Plato, there are two worlds: the world of sensuous experience and the world of Forms. The world of Forms is the world of eternal and unchanging objects and properties. The world of sensuous experience is the world of impermanent and changing objects and properties.\nPlato believed that we can have knowledge of the Forms. But how is this possible, given that we can't touch, see, or observe the Forms? Plato's answer is that we can know the Forms through the process of abstraction.\nTo understand this, consider a particular object, such as a tree. We can abstract the properties of a tree to create a general idea of a tree. This abstraction represents the Form of a tree. We can have knowledge of the Form of a tree by abstracting the properties of a particular tree.\nBut what is the nature of this knowledge? Plato's theory of Forms is a theory of knowledge. According to Plato, knowledge is justified true belief. To have knowledge of a Form, then, is to have a justified true belief about the Form.\nBut how can we have a justified true belief about a Form? One way to have a justified true belief about a Form is by abstracting it from a particular object. This process of abstraction is justified because it is a reliable way to form a true belief about a Form.\nFor example, we can have a justified true belief about the Form of a tree by abstracting the properties of a particular tree. This is a true belief because the abstraction accurately reflects the world. It is justified because the process of abstraction is a reliable way to form true beliefs."}

We believe that our moral and political beliefs are a good guide to the truth because they have been developed over time to fit the world. As a result, they are more likely to be true than the beliefs of people who have not tested their beliefs against the world.\nTo make a claim about justice justifiable, Rawls believes that we need to show that it is a good fit with our moral and political beliefs. This is different from deducing a claim from self-evident premises, or deriving it from some initial moral intuitions. These methods do not test a claim against the world.\nRawls's own example of a justifiable conception of justice is the principle of equal basic liberties.

Culture is learned, and it can change over time.\nMany anthropologists believe that behavior is a result of both genetics and culture. For example, how a person behaves in a particular situation involves a combination of their genetically inherited traits and the cultural patterns they have learned.\nSome behaviors, such as riding a bicycle, are shaped by both genetics and culture.

Externalists believe that the meaning of things is not fixed, but rather depends on the ways that we use them. For example, the meaning of a word is not fixed by its definition, but rather by the ways that people use the word in practice."}

The weaker version states that the goods and services must be available to be produced. The stronger version states that the goods and services must be both available and affordable to be produced.\nSOLUTION: Singer considers the stronger version of the principle to be correct. The weaker version is not correct, because it is possible for goods and services to be produced without being available to consumers. For example, if no one knows how to produce a new product, it is not available, even though it has been produced."}

Of the two, he believed that pain was the lesser master, and pleasure the greater. In other words, it is better to seek out pleasure and to avoid pain.\nHowever, Bentham's pleasure and pain are not just about having a good time. They are about what is good for people. Bentham believed that the good is what makes people happy.

Happiness is not a feeling or sensation. It is not a craft.\nSOLUTION: Aristotle believed that happiness is a state of mind. It is a state of being. It is a state of life.

Two different types of questions are asked about the nature of good:\nDescriptive questions ask what good is. These questions try to describe what we usually mean when we call something or someone good. For example, you might ask what it means to say that a person is good at a sport.\nNormative questions ask what good is supposed to be. These questions ask what we ought to mean when we call something or someone good. For example, you might ask what it means to say that a person should be good to others.\nPhilosophers also discuss the following fallacies, or types of errors, that can occur when using language in an unsound or incorrect way:\nA begging-the-question fallacy occurs when an argument or claim assumes what it is trying to prove. This type of fallacy can appear in any subject area.\nFor example, an argument that is trying to prove that this car is reliable because it has never broken down begs the question. The car's never breaking down is what is in question.\nA circular reasoning fallacy occurs when an argument supports a claim with the claim itself. This type of fallacy can appear in any subject area.\nFor example, an argument that is trying to prove that this car is worth buying because it is a good car begs the question. The word good is defined in terms of being worth buying.\nA naturalistic fallacy occurs when an argument claims to be getting to what is good in some way, but in fact is only getting to what people do. This type of fallacy often occurs in ethics.\nFor example, an argument that is trying to prove that what is good is whatever people tend to do is a naturalistic fallacy. This type of argument may be true, but it is not getting to the truth of what is good.\nAn ad hominem fallacy occurs when an argument attacks the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. This type of fallacy can occur in any subject area.\nFor example, a homeowner who is trying to get the zoning board to reject a new apartment building is committing a ad hominem fallacy if they argue, \"We don't want that builder in our community.\"\nSOLUTION: Moore claims that many past philosophers are guilty of begging the question. They argue that good is whatever they say it is. For example, they define good in terms of what is commonly sought by humans, or what has been agreed on by humans. But these definitions beg the question because they assume what is good is whatever people seek or agree on."}

He believed that happiness was the highest good, and that pleasure was the only kind of happiness.\nEpicurus said that wealth could be a means to happiness, but only if it was obtained without pain and without taking away from the happiness of others. He believed that wealth was a valuable tool for attaining happiness, as long as it was used to gain pleasure and to avoid pain.\nSOLUTION: According to Epicurus, the wealth required for a good life is available only to the rich. In Epicurean philosophy, the rich have the greatest opportunity to attain the kind of wealth that can bring happiness. The rich can afford to buy whatever they want, and they have more leisure time to enjoy it. However, the rich are not guaranteed to find happiness. They can only do so by using their wealth to gain pleasure and to avoid pain."}

But this is a false dichotomy.\nMaking moral judgments does not mean you have to be intolerant, closed-minded, or dogmatic. In fact, you can be open-minded, tolerant, and even skeptical, and still make moral judgments.\nIt is essential to recognize that not all claims are of equal value. Some claims are a matter of opinion, but many claims are not. Claims based on evidence and reason are not a matter of opinion.\nFor example, it is a matter of opinion what color you want to paint your house. But it is not a matter of opinion that water freezes at one degree Celsius.\nA moral judgment is a claim based on evidence and reason. It is not a matter of opinion.\nFor example, it is a moral judgment that it is wrong to assault another person. It is not a matter of opinion.\nA moral judgment can be based on evidence and reason. For example, it is a moral judgment that it is better to recycle. This judgment is based on the evidence that recycling helps to conserve resources and reduces pollution."}

Since people from different cultures may have different ways of thinking about things, cross-cultural communication can be difficult.\nAccording to cognitive schemas, people break down sensory information into discrete pieces of knowledge that are stored in their memories. These knowledge chunks are called cognitive schemas. Cognitive schemas can help people make sense of the world. But they can also lead to misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication.\nFor example, a Chinese friend may use a cognitive schema that includes the concept of face. In China, face is the idea that a person's societal status should be maintained. To a Chinese person, being respectful and polite is very important.\nIf a Chinese friend invites you to dinner and then tells you that the food is prepared, you might be surprised. In the United States, it is customary to invite someone to dinner before mentioning that the food is ready. But in China, the invitation includes the idea that the food is prepared.\nIn another example, an American friend may use a cognitive schema that includes the concept of punctuality. In the United States, people are expected to arrive on time for appointments. If an American friend is coming to meet you, it is usually assumed that they will arrive on time.\nIf your American friend is going to be late, they might call you. In the United States, people use phone calls to update each other on their whereabouts. But in some other countries, people do not use phone calls in this way.\nSOLUTION: Aristotle believed that there was an ideal way of doing things. According to Aristotelian thinking, people from different cultures may view their interaction in an absolutist way. They may believe that their own culture's way of doing things is the best way.\nNussbaum claims that in cross-cultural communication, inhabitants of different conceptual schemes tend to view their interaction in a relativist way. In a relativist way, people recognize that different cultures have different ways of doing things. But people still have a preference for their own culture's way of doing things.\nKantian thinking is based on the idea that people should treat others as ends, not means. According to Kantian thinking, people from different cultures may view their interaction in a Kantian way. In a Kantian way, people recognize that different cultures have different ways of doing things. But people also recognize that they should treat other cultures with respect."}

Fallibility means that the rule or principle is revisable if it leads to bad outcomes.\nSOLUTION: A moral criterion of adequacy is a standard against which to evaluate moral rules or principles. A moral rule or principle is considered adequate if it meets the criteria of simplicity, consistency with our considered moral judgments, fruitfulness, and fallibility.\nFruitfulness means that the rule or principle leads to a better outcome than other available rules or principles."}

One way to do this is to enter into moral agreements that are equally favorable to all parties.\nA moral agreement is an agreement concerning what is right and wrong, what is just and unjust. Such agreements can help us coordinate our actions with the actions of others.\nMoral agreements are made when people decide to follow certain rules or principles. These rules and principles can be written down, as in a law, or they can be informal.\nSome moral agreements are created with the intention of maximizing the productivity of society. For example, people might agree to pay taxes to support the government. In this case, the moral agreement is intended to benefit society as a whole.\nOther moral agreements are created to satisfy the conceptual constraint against exploitation. For example, people might agree not to kill each other. In this case, the moral agreement is intended to prevent one person from exploiting another.\nSome moral agreements are created to satisfy our desire for fairness. For example, people might agree to play a game with the rules written down. In this case, the moral agreement is intended to make the game fair."}

Traditional art is intended to represent the world as it appears to us. This is not to say that traditional art is photographic. Traditional art can exaggerate, stylize, or simplify real life. But it does strive to show us the world as we know it.\nThe Easter Island statue is an example of traditional art. The statue does not look like a real human being. But it does represent what a human being looks like.\nRepresentation is one of the key differences between traditional and modern art.\nIn modern art, the idea of representation is challenged. Modern art does not have to show the world as it appears. Instead, modern art can show how the world is experienced.\nFor example, a painting of a road through a forest might make the trees look taller than they really are. A modern artist might use these exaggerated trees to express the feeling of being lost or trapped.\nSo, representation is one of the key traits of traditional art.\nSOLUTION: Traditionally, art is defined as representation. A representation is an image or picture that shows the world as it appears to us.\nThe hammer is a representation of a tool. It shows what a tool looks like.\nThe sculpture of a bird is a representation of a bird. It shows what a bird looks like."}

This means that an action is unjust if it violates a natural law, a law that is not the result of human convention. For example, a natural law is that people should not be killed. If an action violates a natural law, then the action is unjust.\nA action is unjust if it takes more than one's share of a good. This means taking more than your fair share of a limited good. This applies to actions that involve rivalry or competition for a limited supply of goods.\nA action is unjust if it is contrary to a covenant or agreement.

Instead, we need to choose what is fair. To help decide what is fair, Rawls believes that we can use the idea of a social contract.\nImagine that you and your friends are the last people on earth. You are sitting around a fire, and you want to decide how to share your food and water. One friend proposes that the strongest person eat the most food and drink the most water. This proposal is based on self-interest and might seem fair at first. But as a weak friend begins to starve and die of thirst, the other friends will see that this proposal is not fair.\nRawls believes that we can do better. Instead of just looking at our own self-interest, we can look to the interests of any person in our situation. Imagine that you are all equal. The friend who proposes the social contract will know that he or she will get an equal share of food and water. So, this friend will propose that each person get an equal share.\nThis idea of the social contract can help you decide what is fair. To decide what is fair, you need to choose what you would agree to if you were equal.\nSOLUTION: Rawls believes that the two parts of his theory are interdependent. You cannot accept one part without accepting the other.\nRawls believes that we are all equal and have certain basic rights. These rights are guaranteed by justice. We can use social institutions to realize these rights and create a just society.\nRawls also believes that we want to make the right choices about how to use our basic rights. To do this, we need to choose what is fair. Fairness is based on the idea of the social contract. To decide what is fair, you need to choose what you would agree to if you were equal."}

The moral aspect is the part of the self that is responsible for the self's actions. The individual aspect is the part of the self that is influenced by the self's needs and desires.\nGauthier claims that the social self is too narrow. It does not capture the full breadth of the self. To account for all of the ways in which the self is influenced, we need to expand the self to include the natural self. The natural self is the part of the self that is influenced by the self's needs and desires."}

Nonconsequentialist ethics is the idea that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends not on its consequences but on its intrinsic features.\nAccording to Anscombe, the categorical imperative is a scheme for deciding what we ought to do. To determine what we ought to do, we must decide what principles ought to guide us. But these principles cannot be grounded in the nature of the world. For if they are based on the nature of the world, then they would be based on what happens to satisfy us or to help us. This would make the rightness or wrongness of an action depend on its consequences, and so make the rightness or wrongness depend on the nature of the world.\nSo, the principles that guide us must be grounded in the nature of the imperative itself. But the imperative tells us to do something. It does not tell us what we want. So, the principles that guide us cannot be based on our own nature.

An ideal moral code takes into account the goals of the individual and the needs of society.\nSo, a moral code is ideal in part because it is complex. As a moral code becomes more complex, it becomes more ideal. A simple moral code may not be able to address all of the complexities of life.\nA moral code is ideal in part because it is likely to be followed. A moral code is ideal if it is consistent with human nature.

In other words, the mind is created by the body.\nFunctionalism is the view that the mind is made up of various mental functions. These functions can be carried out by the brain or other parts of the body. So, the mind is not a separate substance from the body."}

For example, consider the age-old question of whether the ends justify the means. One person may believe that they do, while another person may believe that they do not. This is a ethical disagreement.\nAn ethical disagreement does not mean that one person is right and the other person is wrong. It is possible for each person to have a valid perspective.\nSome ethical disagreements may be due to different inclinations. For example, a person who is more inclined to take risks may be more likely to believe that the ends justify the means. But this does not mean that the person who is less inclined to take risks is wrong."}

In ethics, a duty is a set of obligations that you have to others. A duty is a responsibility, and each duty has a standard that tells you how well you are fulfilling that duty.\nA prima facie duty is a duty that is still being considered. You have a prima facie duty to others when you have an obligation to help them, but the extent of your obligation is still being evaluated.\nFor example, arriving on time to a meeting is a duty you have to others. Canceling the meeting at the last minute is a violation of this duty. You have a prima facie duty to others in this situation, because you have an obligation to help them, but the extent of your obligation is still being evaluated.\nSOLUTION: To explain the notion of a prima facie duty, Ross draws an analogy with the commands of a dictator. A dictator's commands are not laws, but they are commands that you must follow. Likewise, a prima facie duty is a responsibility that you have to others, but the extent of your obligation is still being evaluated."}

He described reason as a kind of psychological force that stimulates the person to believe or desire something. Hume argued that reason is not a source of new desires or beliefs, but rather a tool that we use to justify beliefs and desires that we already have.\nFor Hume, reason is the slave of the passions. The passions are stronger than reason, and they can cause reason to distort how we see the world. When the passions are strong, they can make us believe things that are not true."}

One implication of this theory is that the rightness of an act is a function of its consequences.\nFor utilitarianism, the consequences of an act determine its rightness. An act is right if it brings about the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. An act is wrong if it brings about more suffering for more people than any other available act.\nThus, according to utilitarianism, we should always consider the consequences of our acts. The rightness of an act can change depending on its consequences. This means that the rightness of an act is not determined by the act's actual and recognized rules, its ideal rules, or whether or not one's maxim can be universalized."}

{"question": "Nussbaum claims that at the first stage of ethical inquiry, terms for the virtues should be:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "as descriptive as possible."}, {"label": "B", "text": "those that are conventionally used."}, {"label": "C", "text": "neutral between competing specifications of the virtue."}, {"label": "D", "text": "none of the above."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Ethical inquiry involves reasoning about what is right or wrong, good or bad, just or unjust, and what actions or policies would be best to promote the good. Ethical inquiry is different from other kinds of inquiry, such as scientific or mathematical inquiry, because in ethics, we are concerned with judgments about what is right.\nJudgments about what is right often involve disputes about the concepts involved. For example, different people might have different concepts of what is meant by a \"just\" society. Some people might focus on issues of individual liberty, while others might focus on issues of equality.\nEthical inquiry begins with the ordinary language used to describe virtues and vices. In the first stage of ethical inquiry, terms for the virtues should be used as descriptive as possible. This means using terms that identify the kind of person who has the virtue. For example, the descriptive term for the virtue of courage is \"brave.\"\nIn the second stage of ethical inquiry, terms for the virtues should be those that are conventionally used. This means using terms that are currently in use in the culture. For example, the conventional term for the virtue of wisdom is \"smart.\"\nIt is generally not helpful to use neutral terms for the virtues or vices. A neutral term is a term that identifies a virtue or vice but does not indicate what the virtue or vice is. For example, the neutral term for the virtue of courage is \"courageous.\" A neutral term can make it difficult to decide what is right or wrong."}

It explores some of the most basic questions that humans can ask, including: How does the world work? How can we know the world is as it appears to be? What is the best way to live? What is the meaning of life?\nThere are many different branches of philosophy, or areas of inquiry within philosophy. Some of the main branches are:\nMetaphysics: the study of the most basic features of the world. Metaphysics asks questions about the nature of existence, space, and time; the nature of matter and energy; and the relationship between the mind and the body.\nEpistemology: the study of knowledge. Epistemology asks questions about how we know what we know. It addresses questions such as: What is knowledge? How is knowledge acquired? Can we know anything with certainty?\nAxiology: the study of values. Axiology asks questions about what is valuable and what is not. It addresses questions such as: What is the best way to live? What is the meaning of life? What is a good person?\nLogic: the study of reasoning. Logic examines the principles of good reasoning and the standards for evaluating arguments. It is the study of how to distinguish a good argument from a bad one.\nSOLUTION: Bioethics is a branch of ethics, or axiology. Bioethics explores the ethical issues that arise from advances in medicine and biology. It addresses questions such as: What makes a life valuable? What is the ethical importance of health? Is it ethical to clone humans?\nCategorical logic is a branch of logic. Categorical logic studies the principles of logic that are common to all disciplines. It is the study of the common features of all forms of reasoning.\nAesthetics is a branch of axiology. Aesthetics explores the nature of art, beauty, and taste. It asks questions such as: What is art? What is beauty? How do we know what is good taste?"}
