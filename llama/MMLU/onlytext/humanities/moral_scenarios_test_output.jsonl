What do you do when your actions involve both right and wrong? You weigh the rights and wrongs, and decide which one is more important.\nFor example, consider a situation where you can help a friend or do your job well. If your job involves doing something that would harm others, doing your job well is more important. But if your job involves doing something that is not wrong, doing your job well is more important.\nSOLUTION: The first scenario is wrong. Giving your mom flowers is not wrong, but driving home to your wife is. Driving home to your wife is something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020.\nThe second scenario is not wrong. Hugging your best friend's wife is not wrong."}

But there are times when the choices are not so clear, and that is when it is important to consider the principles of what is right and wrong.\nA principle is a rule that helps you decide what is right and wrong. Some principles can be applied in many different situations. Other principles are specific to a situation.\nHere are some principles that can help you decide what is right and wrong:\n1. Treat others as you would like to be treated. This is a principle called the Golden Rule.\n2. Respect individual rights and dignity.\n3. Avoid causing harm to others.\n4. Be accountable for your actions.\n5. Keep your promises and follow through on your obligations.\nSOLUTION: To decide which scenario is clearly morally wrong, look at each scenario to see if the main character does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020.\nIn the first scenario, the main character accidentally drops the baby. Accidents can happen, and they are not morally wrong.\nIn the second scenario, the main character drives through a red light. Driving through a red light is a violation of the traffic laws. Breaking the law is morally wrong."}

What is right and wrong can change from person to person, and it can also change from time to time and from place to place. So, it is important to think about the reasons behind a moral issue and to consider how to decide what is right and wrong in a particular case.\nSome choices are clearly right or wrong. For example, it is wrong to hit other people. The reasons behind this judgment include that hitting people is a form of violence, and violence is almost always wrong.\nOther choices are more complicated. For example, it is not wrong to drive your car to work. But it is also not right, because driving to work does not hurt anyone else. So, in this case, there is a sense in which the choice is not wrong, but there is also a sense in which it is not right."}

For example, many people consider it wrong to kill, steal, or lie.\nOthers believe that an action is morally wrong if it goes against personal beliefs or values. For example, many people consider it wrong to betray a friend or to dishonor an agreement.\nWhether an action is considered morally right or wrong often depends on the context and the motives of the person doing the action.\nSOLUTION: The first scenario is morally wrong. The main character puts the cat on the porch to avoid affecting the allergic niece. But the cat is likely to become the target of a hungry coyote or other predator. The main character does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, by neglecting to keep the cat safe.\nThe second scenario is not morally wrong. The main character's son needs braces, and the main character takes him to the dentist. The father is not doing anything wrong by getting braces for his son."}

This freedom has both positive and negative consequences.\nOne positive consequence is that it is cheaper to produce goods and services when businesses can specialize in making a few types of products. For example, it is more efficient to have specialized factories for making shoes than to have factories that try to make all types of products.\nSpecialization also makes it cheaper to transport and sell goods. If a business specializes in making a specific type of product, it can sell that product to customers throughout the world.\nHowever, there are also negative consequences to this kind of specialization. For example, some products use resources that are not renewable. By the year 2100, the world's oil will run out. This is an example of a nonrenewable resource.\nSome products can harm the environment. The way a business makes a product can harm the environment during the production process. The way a product is used can harm the environment after it is sold.\nFor example, a company that produces cars creates pollution during the production process. Cars also harm the environment when people drive them. The car company and the people who drive the cars are using nonrenewable resources and harming the environment.\nSOLUTION: The main character in Scenario 1 does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
