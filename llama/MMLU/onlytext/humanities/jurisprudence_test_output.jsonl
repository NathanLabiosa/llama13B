Each rule has a maker. The maker of a rule is called the rule's \"author.\"\nA rule's author can confer power on the rule. Conferring power means giving the rule the ability to require that certain things be done.\nA rule's power is based on the author's power. An author's power is based on the author's relationship to the rule.\nAn author's relationship to a rule includes whether the author made the rule.\nSome rules are made by a specific person. These rules are made by an individual who has the authority to make rules. The president of a country is an example of such an individual.\nOther rules are made by a group of people. These rules are made by a committee or a board.\nA rule's power is based on the author's relationship to the rule.\nA rule's power is also based on whether the rule is written down. A written-down rule is called a \"published rule.\" A rule that is not written down is called an \"unpublished rule.\"\nA published rule is given power by its publication.\nAn unpublished rule is given power by its communication to those who are subject to the rule.\nSOLUTION: Hart's distinction between \"being obliged\" and \"having an obligation\" distinguishes the nature of a rule. It explains the concept of a rule.\nTo be obliged to do something means that you are required to do it. To have an obligation means that you are required to do something.\nThe distinction between \"being obliged\" and \"having an obligation\" shows that you can be required to do something even if you did not know about the rule that requires it."}

The roles define the rights and duties of the people who occupy them. In a status society, social bonds are formed by the relationships between the roles.\nA contract society is a society in which people make contracts with one another. The rights and duties of the people in a contract society are defined by the contracts. In a contract society, social bonds are formed by the relationships between the contracts.\nMaine's aphorism has been misunderstood in several ways:\nIt is misinterpreted as a prediction. The aphorism is not a prediction. It is a description of what has happened in many societies.\nHis concept of status is misrepresented. Maine's aphorism does not equate status with a particular type of society. The same status system can exist in a contract society, and a contract system can exist in a status society.\nIt is taken literally. The aphorism is not meant to be taken literally. It uses the jargon of sociology in a nonliteral or unusual way.\nHis idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems. Maine's aphorism is not limited to Western legal systems. It describes a broader social pattern that is found in many societies, including many that are not based on Western legal traditions.\nSOLUTION: Maine's aphorism is a description of a pattern that has been observed in many societies. It is not a prediction of what all societies will do. It is not a claim about what is happening now. It is not a claim about what will happen in the future. To understand the aphorism, you need to understand the ways in which it uses jargon.\nThe aphorism equates status and contract with types of social bonds.

The concept of natural law holds that there are certain rights and freedoms that are inherent in human nature and that governments have a duty to protect.\nThe revival of natural law in the 20th century was influenced by several factors. One major factor was the depression of the 1930s. As people suffered through the economic hardships of the depression, they began to question the legitimacy of capitalist governments. The idea of natural law provided an alternative to capitalism, offering a way to explain how governments should work and what governments should aspire to achieve.\nThe rise of fascism also contributed to the revival of natural law. Many people believed that fascist regimes violated natural law. For example, fascist governments often did not allow free speech or fair trials. These fascist violations of natural law led many people to re-examine the concept of natural law.\nThe international recognition of human rights after World War II also contributed to the revival of natural law. Many people came to believe that governments have a duty to protect human rights and that human rights are derived from natural law.\nThe Bolshevik Revolution did not contribute to the revival of natural law. In fact, the Bolshevik Revolution challenged the idea of natural law. The Soviet Union, led by the Bolsheviks, was established on the idea that people should not have to accept an unjust system. Instead, they could work to change it. This idea challenged the traditional concept of natural law."}

Weber believed that the spirit of capitalism arose in the West, in part, as a response to the religious and political struggles of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\nSOLUTION: Weber claims that the spirit of capitalism emerged in England because of the country's unique political and religious history. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, England was embroiled in a series of intense political and religious disputes. These struggles created a climate of uncertainty, and people began to turn to commerce as a way of life that offered greater economic and social security.\nMoreover, the English legal system was conducive to the development of capitalism.

According to legal realists, law is not arbitrary, but it is also not a perfect system.\nThe fundamental principle of legal realism is that the law is made by human beings, and that its creation is shaped by human flaws and biases. This principle challenges the idea that law is an objective and neutral system. Instead, legal realists argue that law is a human institution that reflects the goals and values of its makers and enforcers.\nOne important insight of legal realism is that law is not completely independent of politics. Instead, politics and law are intertwined, and the nature of the relationship between them is shaped by the distribution of power in society.\nFor example, legal realists would argue that the law is not an impartial referee in disputes between powerful and less powerful parties. Rather, the law is more likely to side with the powerful. This insight into the relationship between law and politics has important implications for how one understands the role of law in society.\nSOLUTION: Fuller's inner morality of law is a morality of aspiration. It is a view of law that shares some of the goals of the harm principle, but it does not entirely embrace the harm principle.\nThe harm principle states that there is a presumption that individuals have the right to use their own resources as they see fit, as long as they do not harm others. This means that individuals are free to do as they please, unless their actions harm others.\nAccording to Fuller, the harm principle is too permissive. It is too permissive because it does not take into account the fact that people's actions can be harmful to others in indirect ways. For example, smoking can harm others by causing pollution.\nFuller's inner morality of law is a more aspirational view of law. It does not claim that there is a clear and objective answer to the question of what law should do. Instead, this view of law sets forth an aspiration: the law should aspire to be a neutral and impartial system that maximizes the use of individual resources in the service of the greater good."}

These rules and principles are to be applied consistently, and they are best understood by focusing on the arguments for and against them. When a legal decision involves a core constitutional principle, the decision is a matter of integrity. The political branches are bound by the Constitution, which is itself an expression of the community's integrity.\nThe integrity of the law is maintained when legal officials properly apply the rules of the community. This application of rules, in turn, helps to define the community's core concepts and principles. The process of applying the rules and principles to specific cases helps to refine and clarify them."}

A principle is a rule that is designed to guide the decision of a legal case. A policy is a rule that is designed to guide the legislative decision of a legal case.\nA principle is a rule that is designed to guide the decision of a legal case. For Dworkin, a principle is a necessity. That is, a principle is a rule that cannot be ignored without violating some moral principle. For example, a principle that a person may not be punished without due process of law is a necessity for Dworkin.\nA policy is a rule that is designed to guide the legislative decision of a legal case. For Dworkin, a policy is an option. That is, a policy is a rule that can be disregarded without violating any moral principle. For example, a policy that a traffic light must switch to yellow before turning red is an option for Dworkin.\nSOLUTION: Dworkin's distinction between principles and policies can be described as follows: Principles describe rights, policies describe goals. This means that principles are justified by reference to values, and policies are justified by reference to the goals of the legal system.\nFor Dworkin, rights are moral principles that determine the minimal level of respect that a legal system must give to its members. For example, the right to freedom of speech is a moral principle that is justified by the value of expressive freedom.\nThe goals of the legal system are the objectives that the legal system is designed to achieve. For Dworkin, the goal of the legal system is to protect and promote the common good. For example, the policy that a traffic light must switch to yellow before turning red is justified by the goal of reducing traffic accidents."}

One ongoing debate is about utilitarianism, an ethical theory that focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Utilitarians seek to produce the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people.\nJeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, believed that the best action is the one that leads to the greatest amount of happiness. He believed that happiness is the only thing that is truly good. So, if one action is happier than another, then it is the better choice.\nBentham's felicific calculus is his method for determining the best action. To use Bentham's calculus, you compare the amount of happiness generated by each possible action. The most felicific (happy-making) choice is the one that produces the most happiness.\nHowever, some critics have offered powerful refutations of Bentham's theory.\nOne criticism is that happiness is less important than economic prosperity. Some people believe that being very happy but poor is not as good as being slightly happy and rich.\nAnother criticism is that it is impossible to calculate all the consequences of one's acts. It is impossible to predict the future with certainty. So, it is impossible to calculate the consequences of a particular action.\nA third criticism is that pain and pleasure are inevitable features of life. Some acts cannot be evaluated as solely happy or unhappy. For example, deciding to die with dignity is a choice that is not solely happy or unhappy.\nA fourth criticism is that utilitarianism fails to take account of differences in social background. Utilitarianism assumes that all people have the same needs and wants. But people with different social backgrounds have different needs and wants."}

{"question": "How does Nozick answer the criticism of his historical entitlement theory that if the distribution of goods in society is unjust those at the bottom always lose?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It can be remedied by redistribution of wealth."}, {"label": "B", "text": "If each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Historical factors are secondary to moral imperatives."}, {"label": "D", "text": "He has no answer."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Philosophers believe that the distribution of goods in society is unjust if it is not fair or if it does not benefit the least well-off. It is not clear, however, what makes a distribution of goods fair or how much benefit is enough. These questions are matters of ongoing debate among philosophers.\nHistorical entitlement theory is one approach to justice. According to this theory, a distribution of goods is just if people have a just sense of entitlement to their holdings. A just sense of entitlement is based on the idea that people are entitled to their holdings if they have a right to them, if they have fair procedures to follow in order to obtain them, or if they have voluntarily acquired them.\nOn this view, a distribution of goods is not just if it is the result of an unjust distribution that has persisted for a long time. For instance, if a rich uncle left you a fortune in his will, you have a just sense of entitlement to the money. But if the rich uncle acquired the money through fraud, you do not have a just sense of entitlement to the money.\nSome people have criticized historical entitlement theory by pointing out that if the distribution of goods in society is unjust, those at the bottom always lose. This criticism claims that if a distribution of goods is just, the present holders of goods are entitled to them. But the present holders of goods are usually the rich and powerful. So, this theory seems to make the rich and powerful entitled to their holdings. This looks unfair.\nNozick's answer to this criticism is that if each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just. Nozick claims that the fact that the rich and powerful have a just sense of entitlement to their holdings does not make the distribution of goods unfair. To show that a distribution of goods is unfair, you need to show that the holdings of some people are unjust. You cannot show this by showing that the holdings of the rich and powerful are unjust."}

Norms tell you what is expected of you in various situations.\nDurkheim believed that the main function of punishment is to maintain the integrity of the social institutions that make up a society. Punishment must be ordered by society's legal system, or state. This is the only way that the state can send a clear message to society's members about what is expected of them.\nWhen the state punishes individuals who violate these norms, it is sending a message to all members of society about the kinds of behavior that are unacceptable. This message is designed to have a deterrent effect on potential rule breakers. The threat of punishment can help to prevent people from breaking the rules in the first place.\nIn Durkheim's view, punishment is not intended to change the character of the offender.

They ask: how is the law used to maintain a particular social order? How do those with power use law to protect their interests? How do people challenge illegal or unfair laws?\nSOLUTION: Critical legal theorists would reject the proposition that law is determinate. A determinate system is a system with clear limits and order. Instead, critical legal theorists argue that law is unstable. This means that law is not fixed. It can be interpreted and used in different ways."}

This means that for a right to be enforced, another person must have the intention to comply with the duty that enforces the right.\nThe interest theory of rights holds that the enforcement of a right requires the protection of a person's interests. If a person has an interest that is not being protected, then that person has a right that can be enforced.\nSOLUTION: The interest theory of rights can be formulated without assuming the correlativity of rights and duties.\nRegarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty means that X's interest is the reason that Y has a duty. This formulation does not require the exercise of the will by another party.\nAccepting that conferring right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized means that the mere establishment of a right does not require the exercise of the will by another party.\nTreating an interest as the exercise of choice means that a person has a right when it is in the interest of another person to allow the person to do as they choose. This approach does not require the exercise of the will by another party.\nAsserting that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties -only when they are actually imposed means that X's right is not necessarily enforced.

They also differed in their account of life before the social contract and in their views on the nature of contractual obligations.\nHobbes, a contractualist, believed that life before the social contract was a state of nature, a state of constant war and insecurity. In the state of nature, individuals are driven by their own self-interest. According to Hobbes, this self-interest leads to a \"war of all against all.\"\nLocke, a social contract theorist, also saw life before the social contract as a state of nature. In Locke's state of nature, individuals are equal and independent. According to Locke, individuals in the state of nature have the right to \"life, liberty, and property.\"\nThe principal difference between the positions adopted by Hobbes and Locke is their account of life before the social contract.

It is often used to introduce students to the field and to highlight some of the central questions of legal and political philosophy.\nThe case involves five individuals who are stranded in a cave. They have food but no water. The cave is the only source of water, and the water is needed to survive. Each individual needs water to live, but each individual also needs food to survive. The individuals decide that they must eat one of their own in order to survive. They draw straws to determine who will be eaten.\nThe legal system in which the Speluncean Explorers find themselves is similar to the legal system that Fuller was examining in the 1950s. This legal system has a criminal law that prohibits murder. To prove that someone is a murderer, the prosecutor must show that the accused had a guilty mind. The guilty mind is called mens rea.\nThe central question of Fuller's thought experiment is whether the Speluncean Explorers' act of eating one of their own is murder. The act is not done with a guilty mind, but it is not done for food either. The Speluncean Explorers eat one of their own to survive. Is the lack of a guilty mind a defense to murder?"}

This is because the law is based on the idea of fair play, and if people break the law, they are acting unfairly.\nHowever, this argument is not persuasive.\nFirst, fairness is a relative term. What one person thinks is fair may be different from what another person thinks is fair. This makes fairness a somewhat unreliable basis for a moral duty.\nSecond, the legal system is, in fact, unfair. Laws are made by people, and people are not always fair. The legal system has many built-in biases. For example, wealthy people can afford to hire the best lawyers, which means they have an unfair advantage.\nThird, it sets a bad example. An example is a model or pattern. If breaking the law is not punished, some people may follow that example and break the law themselves.\nFourth, the law is irrational and ambiguous. Many laws are based on subjective values. For example, what is 'obscene' is not clearly defined. Some laws are also too complex. They are written in a way that only lawyers can understand. This means that ordinary people cannot be expected to obey them."}

In this work, Hume argues that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on its tendency to produce pleasure or pain. Hume's theory of practical reason is often described as a form of consequentialism, a view that evaluates the rightness or wrongness of an action by its consequences.\nAccording to Hume, the principles of practical reason are as follows:\nEvery action is right that is done with the intention of bringing about the greatest amount of happiness.\nEvery action is wrong that is done with the intention of bringing about the least amount of happiness.\nHume's theory is not a form of legal positivism. Hume does not claim that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on the law. Instead, Hume's theory is a form of ethical consequentialism. Hume's theory is a form of ethical consequentialism. Hume's theory is a form of ethical consequentialism that focuses on the maximizing of happiness.\nJohn Finnis rejects Hume's conception of practical reason for several reasons. First, Finnis argues that Hume's theory is a form of ethical egoism. According to Finnis, Hume's theory is a form of ethical egoism because it focuses on the maximizing of happiness for the individual.\nSecond, Finnis argues that Hume's theory is not a form of practical reason. According to Finnis, practical reason involves the application of moral principles to practical situations. But Hume's theory does not involve the application of moral principles.\nThird, Finnis argues that Hume's theory is inconsistent. According to Finnis, Hume's theory would require that we always do what will bring about the greatest amount of happiness. But there are cases in which it is not in our own interest to do what will bring about the greatest amount of happiness. For example, it is not in our own interest to do an act that is wicked."}

These theories often assume that people have certain abilities or traits that make them deserving of what they have. For example, some traditional theories of justice rely on the assumption that people have certain innate talents or abilities that determine their success. Other theories rely on the assumption that people have certain virtues, such as hard work or thrift, that make them deserving of what they have.\nThe capability approach to justice, by contrast, determines what is just by considering the capabilities that people have to lead the kind of lives they want to lead. A capability is a combination of an action and a desire for that action. A capability is a freedom. To have a capability is to be able to do something, and to have the desire to do it.\nFor example, being able to read is a capability. It is the freedom to be able to read. People have this capability because they have the ability to read and the desire to do so.\nAnother example is the capability to participate in politics. This capability is a freedom. It is the freedom to participate in politics. People have this capability when they have the ability to participate in politics, and the desire to do so.\nThe capability approach to justice is based on the idea that people have many different capabilities. A just society is one in which people have all the necessary capabilities to lead the kind of lives they want to lead.\nThe capability approach to justice does not rely on the assumptions that people have certain innate talents or virtues that make them deserving of what they have. It does not rely on the assumption that people have an equal ability to achieve their goals. It does not rely on the assumption that people want to achieve the same goals.\nInstead, the capability approach to justice focuses on the freedoms that people have to achieve their goals, and on the goals that people actually want to achieve.\nSOLUTION: The capability approach to justice rejects Rawls' theory of justice because it applies only to democratic societies.\nRawls' theory of justice is based on the idea that just societies are fair. A just society is fair because people's social positions are determined by their moral powers.\nRawls believes that people have certain moral powers that make them deserving of their social positions. For example, people have the moral power to work hard, to be honest, and to develop their talents.\nRawls believes that just societies are fair because people's social positions are determined by their moral powers. If people have more moral powers, they are more deserving of a higher social position.\nThe capability approach to justice, by contrast, does not rely on the assumption that people are more or less deserving. It focuses on the freedoms that people have to lead the kind of lives they want to lead."}

But even if the concept of punishment is controversial, it is still possible that punishment is justified. For example, some people think that punishing criminals is justified, even if the concept of punishment is disputed.\nSOLUTION: It is important to separate the concept of punishment from its justification because any definition of punishment should be value-neutral. A value-neutral definition tells you what a word means, without talking about whether the word is good or bad.\nFor example, here is a value-neutral definition of a pun:\nA pun is a type of word play that uses a word or phrase in a humorous way that suggests more than one meaning.\nHere is a definition of a pun that is not value-neutral:\nA pun is a type of humor that shows that words can have multiple meanings.\nThe non-value-neutral definition tells you that puns are good.

Philosophers of jurisprudence try to answer basic questions about law. Some of the questions that philosophers of jurisprudence try to answer are: What is the nature of law? What is the relationship between law and justice? What is the role of a judge?\nJohn Austin is a philosopher of jurisprudence. He claimed that there are four types of rules.\nA rule is a set of instructions. It tells you what you can or cannot do. Rules can have different types.\nA command is a rule that is backed up by a authority. You are not obligated to follow a command. But you may choose to do so.\nA order is a rule that is backed up by a police power. You are obligated to follow an order. But you may choose to disobey an order.\nA law is a rule that is backed up by the state's threat of force. You are obligated to follow a law."}

Legal rules tell you what the law is. They are often called \"black letter law\" because they are written in black and white. Legal principles are the reasons behind the legal rules. They tell you why the law is what it is.\nA legal rule is a statement of what the law requires. Legal rules are often called \"bright line\" rules because they set a clear boundary between what is allowed and what is not. For example, a legal rule called the \"exclusionary rule\" tells you that evidence obtained in a search that violates the Fourth Amendment cannot be used in court.\nA legal principle is a broader statement of what the law is meant to achieve. Legal principles are sometimes called \"hidden rules\" because they are not as clear as legal rules. For example, the legal principle of \"equal protection\" tells you that every person must be treated equally by the law. This principle has been used by courts to strike down laws that treat people differently based on their race, gender, or national origin.\nAnalyze the law by distinguishing between legal rules and legal principles.\nHart's analysis of law distinguishes between theory and fact.\nTheory and fact are two ways to describe what a case is about. In a case, the facts are what happened. The theory is what the case was about.\nFor example, in the case of Jones v. Smith, the facts are the events that led to the case. The theory is whether Smith is liable for the damages that Jones suffered.\nTo analyze the law in Jones v. Smith, you would need to distinguish between the facts and the theory. You could then decide the case based on the theory.\nSOLUTION: To analyze the law in a case, you need to distinguish between legal rules and legal principles.\nA legal rule is a statement of what the law requires. A legal principle is a broader statement of what the law is meant to achieve.\nThe rules and principles are both part of the law. But they have different roles.\nRules tell you what the law requires. Rules are often called \"bright line\" rules because they set a clear boundary between what is allowed and what is not.\nFor example, a rule called the \"exclusionary rule\" tells you that evidence obtained in a search that violates the Fourth Amendment cannot be used in court.\nPrinciples tell you what the law is meant to achieve.

This principle has been used by courts to strike down laws that treat people differently based on their race, gender, or national origin.\nTo analyze the law, you need to distinguish between rules and principles. You can then figure out which rule or principle is at issue in a case.\nOnce you have decided which rule or principle is at issue, you can decide the case. If the rule or principle has been broken, you can decide against the person who broke it."}

In the West, the idea of natural law grew out of the work of classical Greek and Roman philosophers. These philosophers believed that the world had an inherent order, or a set of natural laws, that governed all life.\nThe idea of natural law was developed in the Middle Ages by theologians and scholastic philosophers. They believed that natural law was not only inherent in the nature of things but was also the will of God.\nNatural law had a major influence on the American Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. These documents were based on the idea that human beings have inherent rights that cannot be taken away.\nThe revival of natural law in the 20th century was influenced by the realization that the Enlightenment concept of natural law had been lost. Enlightenment thinkers had emphasized the importance of reason and science in the search for moral and political principles. But by the 20th century, many people felt that reason and science had led to moral and political crises.\nThe international recognition of human rights after WWII contributed to the revival of natural law. Many people believed that the atrocities committed during the war had resulted from a failure to adhere to natural law.\nThe Bolshevik revolution also contributed to the revival of natural law. The Soviets rejected natural law as a decadent bourgeois concept. But many people in the West saw the Soviet Union's actions as a violation of natural law."}

Amendments were added to protect the rights of individuals and to make sure that the federal government does not become too powerful.\nThe Constitution does not contain many specifics about how the government will operate. Instead, it has a general framework. The Constitution does not give specific answers to many questions. For example, it does not say what a senator is or what a cabinet secretary does.

The image of legal reasoning as syllogistic\u2014that is, as a matter of logical deduction from self-evident axioms\u2014is a distortion. Legal reasoning is not like that. Legal arguments often involve interpreting texts, including constitutions, statutes, and judicial decisions. As texts, these materials have meaning that is not self-evident. And the meanings of these texts are not fixed but can change over time.\nJudicial decisions are less important than legislation. This is a correct statement. Judges do not make law in the same way that legislatures do. But judicial decisions are important. They can declare statutes unconstitutional, which effectively vetoes them. And when a court overrules a precedent, it changes the law.\nThe structure of legal reasoning is flawed. This is a correct statement. Legal reasoning is not purely a matter of deducction, and it is not always consistent. Judges may apply different legal rules or interpretations to similar cases, and they may offer different reasons for their decisions."}
{"question": "Which of the following most accurately describes Hart's response to Fuller's argument concerning the invalidity of Nazi law?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Nazi law in question was validly enacted."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The court misunderstood the legislation."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fuller misconstrued the purpose of the law."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Nazi rule of recognition was unclear."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A legal system has two main sources of law: constitutional law and statutory law. Constitutional law includes the basic principles of a legal system. Statutory law includes laws made by human legislatures.\nThe Nazi regime in Germany was in power from 1933 to 1945. During this time, the regime enacted many laws that were invalid under both constitutional and statutory law. But the Nazis demanded that their laws be obeyed.\nIn 1935, the Nazi regime enacted a law that allowed Germans to revoke their Jewish ancestry. This law was clearly targeted at Jews and was part of the Nazi regime's policy of racial purity. Most legal scholars today agree that this law was invalid under the Nazi constitution.\nThe legal principle that a law that is repugnant to the constitution is void, or invalid, means that a law may be declared invalid for violating the principles in a constitution. In the United States, for example, the principle of equal protection of the laws means that the government must treat similarly situated people in the same way. If a law violates this principle, it may be invalid.\nAccording to Fuller's argument, the Nazi law in question was not enacted in accordance with the Nazi rule of recognition. The term rule of recognition refers to the principles that a society uses to decide what is legal. In a legal system with a written constitution, the constitution is the rule of recognition. In a legal system that is not based on a written constitution, the unwritten rules that guide the behavior of the government and the people in a society become the rule of recognition.\nThe Nazi regime in Germany did not have a written constitution. So, the rule of recognition in Nazi Germany was the set of unwritten rules that the regime followed. And the Nazi rule of recognition did not include allowing laws that targeted people for their ethnicity or race."}

The defendant's degree of culpability is assessed, and a percentage is assigned based on that assessment. For example, the degree of culpability is assessed as 50 percent, which is assigned a value of 0.5.\nH is the hazard to the community. The likelihood that the defendant will commit another crime is assessed, and a probability is assigned based on that assessment. For example, the likelihood that the defendant will commit another crime is assessed as 25 percent, which is assigned a value of 0.25.\nThe appropriate punishment is calculated by multiplying the extent of responsibility by the hazard to the community.\nSOLUTION: To determine the appropriate punishment, follow the formula:\nr x H.\nAssistant: The extent of responsibility is 0.5, and the hazard to the community is 0.25.\nSo, the appropriate punishment is 0.5 x 0.25 = 0.125."}

A rule is a direction that is backed up by the power of the government. Rules have four important elements:\nAuthority. This element is determined by the source of the rule. A rule with a high authority is backed up by a source that has a great deal of power. For example, rules made by the United States Supreme Court are backed up by the power of the entire United States government.\nUniversality. This element is determined by whether the rule applies to everyone. A rule with a high universality applies to everyone who lives within the jurisdiction of the government that created the rule.\nObligation. This element is determined by whether the rule is important. A high-obligation rule is a rule that people are required to follow. If you do not follow a high-obligation rule, you may face penalties.\nHierarchy. This element is determined by which rule takes precedence when two rules conflict. A legal system is a set of rules that tells you what you can and cannot do. When two rules conflict, it may be necessary to decide which rule is higher in the hierarchy.\nSOLUTION: Look at the underlined element in the law. It is ordered by a hierarchy of authority. If one of the rules is found in the constitution, then that rule is the highest. If not, look at the laws. Laws are higher than rules. Rules are higher than policies."}

He believed that a country's legal system and culture are so closely intertwined that it is impossible to understand one without understanding the other. For example, the legal system of the United States, with its emphasis on the individual, is a reflection of the culture of the United States, which values independence and self-reliance.\nLaw is like language is a statement that follows logically from Savigny's notion of a Volksgeist.

A legal positivist recognizes that there are standards that are morally valid, but not necessarily a part of the law. The law, on this view, is a separate system of rules that may or may not include these moral standards.\nA naive empiricist in the field of law is someone who believes that the law is whatever courts say it is. This perspective ignores the fact that courts are part of the legal system, and they are bound by the rules of the legal system. In other words, courts do not have the authority to decide that the law is whatever they want it to be.\nSOLUTION: Austin's account of law is based on an anachronistic model of a legal system. He assumes that the law is whatever a sovereign commands. But by the time Austin was writing, the sovereign had almost no role in any legal system.
