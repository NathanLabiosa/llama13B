The room where the testing is done is normally dim. The patient sits at a machine that contains a phoropter, which contains many lenses. The assistant places different lenses in the phoropter and shows the patient a visual chart. The assistant then asks the patient which lenses make the chart look clearer.\nThe assistant adjusts the lenses until the patient determines which lenses make the chart look clearer.\nOnce the assistant has determined the correct lenses, the doctor puts the lenses in glasses for the patient.\nSOLUTION: Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered. When one eye is covered, the other eye can see clearly. The other eye will be used when looking at objects.\nThe outer image is always the false image. Diplopia is a condition in which each eye sees a different image. This condition occurs when the eyes are not pointing in the same direction.\nWhen one eye is covered, the other eye sees the outer image. But the other image is also the true image. So, the outer image is not the false image.\nA fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards. A fourth nerve palsy affects the superior oblique muscle in the eye. This muscle helps point the eye upward.\nWhen the superior oblique muscle is weakened, the eye cannot point upward. So, the eye can see objects above it, but it cannot look up at them.\nA sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint. A sixth nerve palsy affects the lateral rectus muscle in the eye. This muscle helps point the eye outward.\nWhen the lateral rectus muscle is weakened, the eye cannot point outward. So, the eye can see objects on the side, but it cannot look out at them."}

When you exercise, your muscles release acid. This acid can build up in your muscles and make it hard for you to keep working out. Sodium bicarbonate can help stop this acid from building up.\nHow does sodium bicarbonate do this? When sodium bicarbonate is ingested, it is absorbed into the bloodstream and travels to the muscles. There, it enters the muscle cells and helps do the following:\nElevate the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.\nAs the hydrogen ions leave the muscle cells, the pH of the extracellular fluid increases. The increased pH and buffering capacity allow more hydrogen ions to leave the muscle cells, which helps to speed up the process of muscle relaxation."}

Mitochondria have their own DNA, and they use this DNA to produce compounds that are needed for cellular respiration.\nCellular respiration is the process by which cells break down carbohydrates and fats to produce energy. The energy produced by cellular respiration is used by cells to power their activities.\nThe first step in cellular respiration is usually the breakdown of carbohydrates. Cells can break down carbohydrates into a compound called acetyl-CoA. This breakdown process is called glycolysis, and it takes place in the cytoplasm.\nThe acetyl-CoA produced by glycolysis can be used by the mitochondria for cellular respiration. The acetyl-CoA can diffuse into the mitochondria and be used as an intermediate step in the breakdown of carbohydrates.\nThe breakdown of acetyl-CoA by the mitochondria is called the Krebs cycle, or the citric acid cycle. The Krebs cycle produces carbon dioxide, water, and a compound called ATP. ATP is a high-energy compound that is used by cells to power their activities.\nSOLUTION: Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to coenzyme A (CoA).\nCoA is an enzyme that can bind to long-chain fatty acids. When fatty acids are bound to CoA, they can be easily transported into the mitochondria. In the mitochondria, the fatty acids are broken down through a process called beta-oxidation. Beta-oxidation produces acetyl-CoA, which can be used by the Krebs cycle to produce ATP."}

When your muscles contract (tighten), they use energy. Your muscles can get energy from sugar, but they can also get it from breaking down cells such as lactic acid.\nThe breakdown of sugar is called aerobic respiration. This is what happens when your muscles have plenty of oxygen.\nThe breakdown of cells such as lactic acid is called anaerobic respiration. This is what happens when your muscles do not have enough oxygen.\nDuring anaerobic respiration, lactic acid is produced and enters the bloodstream. The blood takes the lactic acid into the liver, where it is removed from the body.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nMuscle phosphocreatine depletion begins in the first few seconds of high intensity exercise.\nMuscle phosphocreatine is a compound that helps muscles make energy. When muscles need energy, they use both sugar and phosphocreatine. But when there is not enough oxygen, muscles use more phosphocreatine than usual.\nAfter a few seconds of high intensity exercise, the phosphocreatine in the muscles is depleted. This means that the muscles have less energy from phosphocreatine."}

Hormones are chemicals that are released by glands into the blood. The hormones go to different parts of the body, where they can affect the behavior of cells.\nThe parathyroid glands are four glands that sit next to the thyroid gland. They produce a hormone called parathyroid hormone, or PTH.\nParathyroid hormone helps control the amount of calcium in your blood. When the level of calcium in your blood is low, the parathyroid glands release PTH. PTH will increase the amount of calcium that is absorbed from the gut and excreted by the kidneys.\nSOLUTION: Calcium is an important mineral that your body needs to build and maintain its teeth, bones, and muscles.\nYour body keeps calcium levels in a narrow range. If your blood calcium is too low, your parathyroid glands will release parathyroid hormone. PTH will help your body move calcium from your bones to your blood. If your blood calcium is too high, your kidneys will remove more calcium from your blood.\nThe chart below shows how parathyroid hormone and calcium in the blood are related.\nIn this chart, the y-axis shows the amount of parathyroid hormone. The x-axis shows the level of calcium in the blood.\nThe curve shows that when your blood calcium is low, the level of parathyroid hormone in your blood is also low.

Glycogen breakdown can provide glucose, which may be used by the liver for storage as glycogen or released into the blood as glucose.\nThe breakdown of glycogen is called glycogenolysis. Glycogenolysis is stimulated by hormones and by the increase in acidity that occurs during exercise.\nWhen you exercise, the muscles use more glucose. The liver sends glucose to the muscles. But the liver can only send so much glucose. If the muscles need more glucose, they break down glycogen.\nThe breakdown of glycogen releases glucose, which is used by the muscles for energy. The breakdown of glycogen is also called glycogenolysis.\nGlycogenolysis is stimulated by hormones, including insulin and epinephrine. Insulin is released by the pancreas and helps store glucose in the liver and in muscle cells. Epinephrine is also released by the pancreas and helps prepare the body for action.\nThe breakdown of glycogen is also stimulated by an increase in acidity that occurs during exercise. When muscles use energy from glucose, the reaction produces carbon dioxide and water. The carbon dioxide is removed from the muscles, but the water is not. The build-up of water during exercise can make the muscles' environment more acidic. This increase in acidity helps stimulate glycogenolysis.\nSOLUTION: Glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle is activated by increased pH. When exercise begins, the pH of the muscles begins to rise. This increase in pH stimulates glycogen breakdown. Insulin and epinephrine also help stimulate glycogen breakdown, but they do not have a direct effect on the muscles' pH."}

It acts to turn creatine and ADP into ATP and phosphocreatine. This reaction can release energy that can be used by the muscles.\nThe activity of creatine kinase increases when intracellular ADP rises.\nMuscle cells need a constant supply of ATP to keep functioning. Creatine kinase helps meet this need. When ADP rises in the cells, the activity of creatine kinase increases. This leads to more creatine and phosphocreatine being turned into ATP, which can be used for energy.\nThe activity of creatine kinase is increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9.\nCreatine kinase is sensitive to the pH of the muscle. When the pH falls below 6.9, the activity of creatine kinase increases. This is because the pH change makes the muscle cells more acidic. More acidic muscle cells need more energy to keep functioning. So, the activity of creatine kinase increases.\nThe activity of creatine kinase is always lower in Type II fibers than Type I fibers.\nType II fibers are designed for short, intense activities. Type II fibers use anaerobic energy metabolism. They do not need as much ATP as Type I fibers. So, the activity of creatine kinase is always lower in Type II fibers than Type I fibers.\nThe activity of creatine kinase increases after a period of endurance training.\nIf you exercise endurance, your muscles will use more oxygen. This will increase the amount of ADP in your muscle cells. So, the activity of creatine kinase will increase."}

A clock can be used to measure short intervals of time as short as one second. But a clock is too slow to measure a time interval of only one second. So, a special instrument called a chronometer is used for that.\nSOLUTION: The smallest increments on a mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometer measure are:\n10 mmHg.\nA mercury manometer has a scale that shows the pressure in millimeters of mercury. The scale has a range of 30 to 230 mmHg. The manometer works by having a column of mercury 10 mm high pressurize a column of air 16 cm high.

When muscles need energy, they use both ATP and phosphocreatine.\nAn athlete's body stores of ATP and phosphocreatine are called their muscle energy storage. Muscle energy storage is important for success in endurance events.\nThe ability to regulate body temperature is important in events that raise the body's temperature. But this characteristic is not important in endurance events.\nThe ability to supply oxygen to the exercising muscles is critical for muscles to use oxygen to make ATP. Muscles need oxygen to make ATP during endurance events.\nThe availability of body stores of carbohydrate is important in endurance events. Carbohydrates are the body's preferred fuel for muscles and brain."}

During intense exercise, muscles may produce more lactate than they can use. When this happens, the lactate accumulates in the blood and must be removed. Removing lactate is one way the body copes with the buildup of lactate during exercise.\nDuring normal metabolism, lactate can be formed from glucose or glycogen breakdown. When glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise, the rate of lactate production increases.\nLactate production increases when the breakdown of glucose and glycogen increases. This occurs when oxygen is readily available.\nLactate production decreases when pyruvate cannot be formed from glucose breakdown. This happens when there is not enough oxygen to form pyruvate.\nLactate production also decreases when the pH of the muscle falls. This can happen when the body produces too much lactate during exercise."}

Some of these molecules, such as water and oxygen, can move across the cell membrane by diffusion. Diffusion is the process by which molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.\nCells also use carrier molecules to move substances across the cell membrane. Carrier molecules move by a different process called active transport. During active transport, carrier molecules pick up substrate molecules from an area of low concentration and move them across the cell membrane to an area of high concentration. Cells use energy from the cell's power source, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to move substrate molecules across the cell membrane during active transport.\nThe hormone insulin promotes glucose uptake by muscle by initiating a type of active transport called facilitated diffusion. Insulin attaches to the cell membrane of muscle cells and activates the carrier molecule that transports glucose. This process allows glucose to move from an area of high concentration (the blood) to an area of low concentration (inside the muscle cell)"}

When your body needs more energy, it breaks down sugar and burns it for fuel. When sugar is broken down, it forms a compound called pyruvate. Your body can use pyruvate for energy, but it can also convert pyruvate into a compound called lactate. When lactate is formed, hydrogen ions are also formed.\nThe formation of lactate and hydrogen ions during exercise is one way your body gets rid of excess hydrogen ions. As your body breaks down sugar and burns it for fuel, hydrogen ions are formed. These hydrogen ions can build up and cause pH to decrease. pH is a measure of the acidity of your body. If pH decreases, your body becomes more acidic.\nYour body needs to get rid of excess hydrogen ions to keep your pH in check. One way your body gets rid of hydrogen ions is by converting pyruvate into lactate. This conversion happens more in some parts of your body than in others. The parts of your body that use a lot of energy, such as your muscles, tend to convert pyruvate into lactate.\nSOLUTION: When glycogen is depleted, hydrogen ions are formed. Glycogen is a substance that stores sugar in your body. When your body needs energy, it breaks down glycogen and turns it into sugar.\nWhen glycogen is broken down, hydrogen ions are formed. These hydrogen ions are formed when hydrogen is removed from glycogen."}

Surfactants are substances that have a solubility in water and in oil. Soap has a hydrophobic, or water-hating, end and a hydrophilic, or water-loving, end. The hydrophilic end of the soap is attracted to water, and the hydrophobic end is attracted to oil. This attraction allows the soap to emulsify, or break apart, oil and water.\nWhen you use soap to wash your skin, the soap's hydrophobic end washes away oil and dirt from your skin. The hydrophilic end of the soap is attracted to water, and your skin's water is drawn to the hydrophilic end. This combination of the soap touching the skin and the water is called the critical micelle. The critical micelle is where the surfactant's cleaning action takes place.\nShampoo is not a surfactant. It does not have a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic end. So, shampoo does not form a critical micelle."}

An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. An organism's genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: An allele that is masked is referred to as recessive. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait.\nA pea plant with only f alleles for the flower color gene will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, the f allele is repressed, or hidden, by the presence of at least one F allele."}

To understand this topic, it may be helpful to review how the human digestive system works.\nThe digestive system breaks down food into small molecules of nutrients, such as sugars and amino acids. These small molecules can then be absorbed through the walls of the digestive organs and into the bloodstream. The blood carries the nutrients to cells throughout the body.\nCells use the nutrients as fuel. Fuel is used to power many important body functions, including breathing, moving, and growing.\nThe digestive system breaks down food into small molecules of nutrients, which are absorbed through the walls of the digestive organs and into the bloodstream.\nThe digestive system has both an upper and a lower part. The upper part is the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. The lower part is the large intestine.\nThe esophagus connects the throat to the stomach. Food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus.\nThe stomach breaks down food through a process called digestion. Three main parts of the stomach play roles in digestion:\nThe lining of the stomach is thin and moist. This lining produces stomach acid and enzymes, which break down food.\nThe muscles of the stomach wall mix and massage the food with stomach acid and enzymes. This mix is called chyme.\nThe esophagus, stomach, and small intestine are parts of the upper digestive system.\nThe small intestine is a long, thin organ that is folded like an accordion. The small intestine is where most digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place.\nThe large intestine is a long tube that is part of the lower digestive system. The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes from the chyme and removes waste products.\nThe liver, pancreas, and large intestine also have important roles in digestion. The liver produces bile, which helps to break down fats in the small intestine. The pancreas produces digestive enzymes that help to break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the small intestine.\nSOLUTION: Adrenaline, also called epinephrine, and carbemazepine may be used to enhance gastric motility.\nAdrenaline and carbemazepine stimulate the muscles of the stomach wall. This stimulation can increase the movement of food through the stomach."}

The electron transport chain uses the energy from electrons that have been transferred along the chain to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. This creates a concentration gradient that drives ATP synthase to turn a rotary motor, which then produces ATP.\nThe protons that have been pumped into the intermembrane space can return to the mitochondrial matrix, but only by emitting a photon. This photon is absorbed by a protein in the electron transport chain, and the energy from the photon is used to pass an electron along the chain.\nThere are several types of proteins in the electron transport chain, each of which can accept an electron from an electron donor. Some of these proteins, such as NADH and FAD, also serve as electron donors. When an electron is passed from an electron donor to an electron acceptor, the electron donor is converted to its reduced form, and the electron acceptor is converted to its oxidized form.\nNADH and FADH2 are electron donors that produce NAD+ and FAD, respectively, when they are reduced. These reduced forms can then donate electrons to the electron transport chain.\nWhen an electron is passed from an electron donor to an electron acceptor, the electron donor is converted to its reduced form, and the electron acceptor is converted to its oxidized form. For example, when NADH is converted to NAD+, NADH is reduced, and when FADH2 is converted to FAD, FADH2 is reduced.\nThe electron transport chain can also be fueled by coenzyme A, which is a type of molecule that can donate a electron to the transport chain. Coenzyme A is a product of the breakdown of fatty acids and other organic compounds.\nWhen coenzyme A donates an electron to the electron transport chain, it is converted to its oxidized form, coenzyme A. This oxidized form can then be converted back to its reduced form by accepting an electron from an electron donor, such as pyruvate.\nSOLUTION: Pairs of electrons carried in the form FADH2 and NADH+H, collectively contain enough free energy to rephosphorylate: 5 ATP.\nThe reduced forms of FAD and NAD, FADH2 and NADH+H, can donate electrons to the electron transport chain. When they do, they are converted to their oxidized forms, FAD and NAD. These oxidized forms can then donate electrons to the electron transport chain.\nBy donating electrons to the electron transport chain, FADH2 and NADH+H can help to produce 5 ATP."}

In the space between the two layers, there are also hydrophilic molecules, such as proteins, that help regulate what enters and leaves the cell.\nCells are made up of many different types of proteins, including proteins in the membrane. Some of these proteins are called integral proteins. They are embedded in the membrane and cannot be removed. Other proteins are called peripheral proteins. They are attached to the membrane and can be removed. Peripheral proteins may have parts that protrude (stick out) into the space between the bilayers. These protrusions are called hydrophilic domains.\nThe hydrophilic domains of peripheral proteins can interact with water-based molecules. This interaction allows the peripheral proteins to transmit signals to the cell. Many peripheral proteins are transmembrane receptors. They can receive signals from outside the cell, or from other cells. When a signal reaches a transmembrane receptor, it tells the cell to turn on or off a protein.

LMN lesions can be caused by injuries, diseases, or conditions that affect the spinal cord or brainstem.\nWhen a lower motor neuron is damaged, the nerve messages to the muscles are disrupted. This can cause muscle weakness or paralysis. The severity of the problem can vary widely, from a small loss of strength to complete paralysis.\nThe assessment of LMN lesions includes testing the reflexes. Reflexes are automatic responses to stimulation that do not require conscious thought.\nThere are many different reflexes in the body. Some reflexes, such as the abdominal reflex, are tested by tapping the appropriate tendon. The abdominal reflex is tested by tapping the patellar tendon.\nOther reflexes, such as the biceps reflex, are tested by tapping a nerve. To test the biceps reflex, the patient is seated and their arm is supported by the examiner. The examiner then strikes the tendon on the opposite arm with a reflex hammer.\nAn absent reflex is a reflex that is not present. An absent reflex can be caused by an LMN lesion.\nFor example, if a patient has an LMN lesion in their spine, they may have an absent biceps reflex. When struck on the opposite arm, their arm will not move.\nA brisk reflex is a reflex that is present and strong. A brisk reflex can be a normal reflex or a reflex caused by an LMN lesion.\nFor example, if a patient has a disease that affects their spinal cord, they may have a brisk cremaster reflex. When their examiner touches their thigh, their leg will move in response to a reflex hammer tapping their groin.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nBrisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion. Absent or weak finger jerks indicate a possible LMN lesion."}

The IV route is also the most common route for medication errors. Many drugs are irritating to the veins and can cause damage to the vein walls. This damage can cause the veins to close, making it difficult to find a vein for administration of other medications.\nIntravenous cannulae should be inserted into a vein and removed from the vein. A cannula should never be inserted into an artery. Arteries and veins have different colors under the skin. Arteries are red. Veins are blue.\nTo insert an IV cannula, follow these steps:\n1. Use a new, sterile cannula for each insertion.\n2. Wash your hands.\n3. Inspect the site where the cannula will be inserted. Clean the site with an alcohol swab.\n4. Put a sterile dressing over the insertion site.\n5. Find a vein. Veins are located just beneath the skin. It may be necessary to move the cannula to find a vein.\n6. Insert the cannula into the vein.\n7. Advanced technique: Use the \"specimen port\" to help you find a vein. The specimen port is a small hole located at the back of the cannula. To use the specimen port, insert the cannula into the vein. Then, rotate the cannula 180 degrees. The specimen port will now be at the front of the cannula. Use the specimen port to find a vein.\n8. SOLUTION: IV administration of a drug will delay its action. The drug must pass through the vein, reach the bloodstream, and travel to the target site in the body. This process can take a few minutes.\nAn intravenous cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration. This can cause the cannula to become contaminated with bacteria. Bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause bacteraemia."}

Your body uses food energy, or calories, to power all of its activities.\nWhen you eat food, your body converts it into a type of fuel called glucose. Glucose is used by cells to produce energy. Cells use this energy to do the work of the body.\nCells in your body need glucose to survive. If your body does not get the glucose it needs, your cells will begin to break down and produce other substances. These substances are called ketones. Ketones are used as fuel for the body when glucose is not available.\nSOLUTION: Muscles use glucose for fuel. The amount of glucose in your blood tells your muscles how much glucose is available.\nIf you eat more calories than you use, the extra calories are stored in your body as fat. Your body can use fat for fuel, but it uses glucose for fuel much faster.\nWhen your muscles have plenty of glucose, they can use a substance called glycogen to store the glucose for later use. Glycogen is a form of carbohydrate that is stored in muscles and liver cells.\nThe amount of glycogen in your muscles and liver is limited. When your glycogen is used up, your body begins to break down muscle tissue to use as fuel.\nSo, the maximum sustainable power is directly related to muscle glycogen content. The more glycogen you have, the more glucose your muscles have for fuel. The more fuel your muscles have, the more power they can produce."}

But how long can you exercise at maximal intensity?\nThe energy released from the breakdown of ATP is called ATP energy. When you exercise, you use ATP energy to power your muscles. Your body can also use a high-energy compound called phosphocreatine to donate energy to your muscles.\nBoth ATP and phosphocreatine are stored in your muscles. But they are stored in different amounts. Your muscles store much more ATP than phosphocreatine.\nSo, your muscles can use ATP energy to fuel short bursts of intense exercise. But intense exercise that lasts longer than a few seconds will cause your body to use up its stored ATP. At that point, ATP must be constantly replenished.\nSOLUTION: To determine how long you can exercise at maximal intensity, consider how long it takes your body to use up its stored ATP and phosphocreatine.\nThe energy released from the breakdown of phosphocreatine can also sustain maximal exertion exercise. But your body can store only a limited amount of phosphocreatine.\nSo, the amount of time that you can exercise at maximal intensity is determined by how long it takes to use up your stored ATP and phosphocreatine."}

An action potential is a brief electrical signal that travels along a nerve or neuron.\nAn action potential is generated when the electrical charge outside a neuron becomes more negative. This negative charge is called the membrane potential. When the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold, an action potential is generated.\nAn action potential spreads along the length of the neuron, activating it to send a signal to a target cell.\nThe resting membrane potential is usually around -70 millivolts. This means that the neuron's membrane potential is -70 millivolts when no action potentials are being generated.\nThe threshold for an action potential is usually around -55 millivolts.

It is located in the anterior neck, in front of the esophagus.\nThe trachea is made of strong cartilage and has a diameter of about 1.5 to 2 centimeters. The trachea is ringed by muscles in the walls of the tube. The rings of muscle help the trachea stay open so that air can flow into the lungs.\nThe trachea has a small hole in it, called the laryngeal opening. The larynx and vocal cords are located just above the laryngeal opening. The larynx and vocal cords can move down to close the opening. This stops food or air from entering the trachea and lungs.\nThe trachea has a larger opening, called the thoracic opening, on each side. One of these openings connects to the beginning of each bronchus. The bronchi are the main tubes that lead to the lungs.\nSOLUTION: An opening in the anterior wall of the trachea above the cricoid cartilage is the correct answer. This opening is called a tracheostomy. A tracheostomy is made when a person needs to breathe through a tube in their neck.\nA tracheostomy can be needed for several reasons. A person may need a tracheostomy if they can't breathe on their own. This can happen when a person has trouble breathing because of chest wounds or paralysis. A person may also need a tracheostomy if they are having trouble breathing because of fluid in their lungs."}

One of the primary ways your muscles get this energy is by breaking down molecules such as glucose and fatty acids. These molecules donate atoms to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the muscles' main source of energy.\nThere are three main ways your body obtains energy during exercise:\nGlycolysis: This process involves breaking down a carbohydrate molecule such as glucose. When glucose is broken down, it donates atoms to produce ATP. Your body can use either blood glucose or stored glucose (glycogen) as a source of glucose.\nTricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle): This process involves breaking down a molecule of fat or a molecule of glucose. The tricarboxylic acid cycle can produce more ATP molecules than glycolysis for each molecule of glucose or fatty acid broken down. However, it uses oxygen, and if oxygen is not available, fewer ATP molecules are produced.\nOxidative phosphorylation: This process also involves breaking down a molecule of fat or a molecule of glucose. During oxidative phosphorylation, the donated atoms are used to produce ATP. Your body can use either fat or glucose as a source for oxidative phosphorylation.\nDuring exercise, your muscles use a combination of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to obtain energy. The exact combination of energy sources used depends on factors such as the type of exercise, the intensity of the exercise, and the availability of oxygen.\nSOLUTION: The most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during exercise is through phosphocreatine breakdown. When your muscles need more ATP, they can use phosphocreatine as a source of phosphorus atoms to donate to ADP to form ATP. This reaction helps your muscles produce ATP more quickly than they can from glucose or fat."}

The type of energy an object has depends on how it is generated.\nQuantity is a measure of how much energy an object has. Quantity can be described by its unit.\nSOLUTION: To determine how much energy an athlete expends, look at the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake. Oxygen uptake is a measure of the energy an athlete's body uses.\nThe athlete's oxygen uptake is 3.0 l/min. This means that the athlete uses 3.0 liters of oxygen per minute.\nOxygen uptake and energy expended are related. More oxygen uptake means more energy expended.\nSo, the athlete expends 3.0 liters/minute \u00d7 60 minutes/1 liter = 180 liters/minute of oxygen.\nThis means the athlete expends 180 liters/minute \u00d7 2.205 pounds per liter = 399.36 pounds of oxygen.\nThis is the amount of energy the athlete expends."}

The stored carbohydrate, glycogen, is found in the liver and muscles. The body can also convert stored fat into fuel during exercise.\nDuring exercise, the body uses carbohydrates and fats as fuels. Carbohydrates are used first, followed by fats. When you eat a high-carbohydrate meal, your body has a limited supply of carbohydrates to use for fuel during exercise.\nThe table below shows how the body uses fuels during exercise.\nFuel source How the body uses it\nCarbohydrates Provide energy for high-intensity exercise.\nFats Provide energy for low-intensity exercise and when carbohydrates are depleted.\nThe table below shows how different foods contain carbohydrates.\nFood type Amount of carbohydrate per serving\nStarchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, and potatoes) 15 to 30 grams\nMilk and yogurt 12 to 15 grams\nSugary foods (such as candy and cookies) 20 to 30 grams\nFruit 15 to 20 grams\nGrains (such as bread and pasta) 20 to 30 grams\nLow-carbohydrate foods (such as meat, dairy, and some vegetables) 0 to 5 grams\nThe amount of carbohydrate in a food is not the only factor that determines how a food affects your blood sugar. Foods also contain fibre, which is found in grains, vegetables, and fruits. Fibre does not get absorbed into the bloodstream, so it does not raise your blood sugar.\nStarchy foods, such as bread and potatoes, contain carbohydrates and fibre. Eating these foods does not raise your blood sugar as much as eating non-starchy foods that contain less fibre.\nSOLUTION: The low intake of carbohydrate in the diet may impair high-intensity exercise performance. When you have not eaten enough carbohydrates, your body has less carbohydrate to use for fuel during exercise. As a result, your body may use muscle glycogen (stored carbohydrate in the muscles) at a higher rate than it would during a high-carbohydrate diet. This can lead to greater reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise and may impair high-intensity exercise performance."}

As the blood flows through the blood vessels, it passes through small vessels called capillaries. Capillaries are so small that they have only one layer of cells. This layer of cells is the wall of the capillaries.\nAs the blood flows through the capillaries, it lets waste products and carbon dioxide escape from the blood. These substances move from the blood into the nearby cells. The cells then remove the waste products and carbon dioxide.\nThe blood also absorbs oxygen from the nearby cells. This oxygen passes into the blood vessels and mixes with the blood. The blood with oxygen in it then flows back to the heart.\nThe heart pumps the blood with oxygen into the blood vessels. The blood with oxygen in it is called blood plasma. The blood vessels then carry the blood plasma to all parts of the body.\nSOLUTION: Oedema is the presence of excessive fluid in the body.
