These bones are in contact with each other, so movements of one bone will affect the other bones.\nThe profile of the face is the side view of the face. The profile can be viewed by looking at the person from the side.\nThe profile of a face is affected by all of the bones in the face. So, if one bone is abnormal, the profile of the face will be abnormal.\nSOLUTION: A \"dished face\" profile is often associated with a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base.\nA recessive maxilla is a maxilla that is too far back. The maxilla is a bone in the forehead. It helps form the bridge of the nose and the upper jaw.\nThe cranial base is the bottom part of the skull. It helps hold the top of the head on.\nDuring a baby's development, the cranial base gets longer. This makes room for the rest of the brain to develop. If the cranial base does not elongate enough, the maxilla will be too far back. This can make the profile of the face appear dished."}

The pulmonary circulation brings oxygen-poor blood to the lungs.\nThe ventricles are separated by a thin muscular wall called the interventricular septum. The left and right ventricles are called the left and right ventricles, respectively.\nThe systemic circulation begins in the left ventricle. When the heart muscle contracts, blood is forced into the aorta, the main artery in the body. The aorta carries the blood to the arteries. As the blood travels through the arteries, it moves into the capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen is released from the blood and is used by the body's cells. The blood is also changed from oxygen-rich to oxygen-poor.\nThe oxygen-poor blood then moves into the veins. The veins carry the blood back to the heart. The oxygen-poor blood is forced into the right atrium. The heart muscle in the right atrium contracts, and the oxygen-poor blood is forced into the right ventricle. The right ventricle contracts, and the oxygen-poor blood is sent to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries.\nThe lungs use the oxygen in the blood to change it into oxygen-rich blood. The oxygen-rich blood is returned to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The heart muscle in the left atrium contracts, and the oxygen-rich blood is forced into the left ventricle.

This gap is called a synchondrosis.\nThe patella (kneecap) is a bone that does not fuse. It has a synchondrosis.\nThe top of the knob on the patella is called the patellar surface. The bottom of the depression in the end of the thigh bone is called the femoral surface.\nWhen you move your knee, the patella glides along the femoral surface.

It is made up of many parts. The mouth is where you put food into your body. The food is cut into small pieces by your teeth.\nThe digestive system is a series of organs that work together to break down food. The digestive system uses enzymes to break down food. Enzymes are substances that make chemical reactions happen.\nThe mouth uses enzymes in saliva to break down food. Saliva is produced by glands in the mouth.\nAfter the food is broken down into small pieces, it is swallowed. Swallowing moves the food into the esophagus, which is a tube that leads to the stomach.\nThe stomach uses strong stomach acid to break down food. The food is also mixed with enzymes in the stomach.\nThe partially digested food is then pushed into the small intestine. The small intestine is where most of the digestion happens. The small intestine has a layer of cells that lines its walls. The cells in this layer are called microvilli.\nThe partially digested food is pushed into the small intestine, where it mixes with bile and pancreatic juice. Bile is made in the liver and helps break down fats. Pancreatic juice is made in the pancreas and contains enzymes that break down carbohydrates and proteins.\nThe mix of food, bile, and pancreatic juice is pushed into the small intestine. Here, the food is broken down into its simplest forms. The body can then absorb nutrients, such as sugars, fats, and proteins, from this mix.\nThe process of digestion is like a assembly line. Food is cut into small pieces in the mouth. Then, it is broken down into smaller pieces in the stomach and small intestine. Finally, the small pieces of food are absorbed into the body.\nSOLUTION: The hard palate is the roof of your mouth. It is made of bone at the front and a fibrous tissue called the palatine aponeurosis at the back.\nThe mucosa of the hard palate is keratinised and has submucosa and minor salivary glands posterolaterally.\nPosterolateral means farther back and to the side.

These cells produce a thick, slippery substance called synovial fluid. Synovial fluid fills the joint cavity.\nThe synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and a shock absorber for the bones. When the bones move, the synovial fluid moves with them. This helps to keep the bones from rubbing together.\nThe synovial membrane has many tiny blood vessels called capillaries. Nutrients and oxygen in the synovial fluid are used by the cells in the synovial membrane.\nA ligament is a tough, fibrous connective tissue. Ligaments connect bones to other bones.\nA tendon is a tough, fibrous connective tissue. Tendons connect muscles to bones.\nAn articular disc is a flat, cushion-like structure.
