{"question": "Profitability stemming from how well a firm positions itself in the market is a key feature of which writer's view on strategy?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Peter Drucker"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Jay Barney"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Michael Porter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Henry Mintzberg"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Management theorists have developed many different views on strategy. One key aspect of strategy is how well a firm positions itself in its market. This aspect of strategy is called a firm's competitive strategy.\nCompetitive strategy involves making decisions about how to compete in an industry. A firm's competitive strategy includes choices about how to differentiate its product or how to compete on price.\nJay Barney has argued that a firm's competitive strategy is the most important part of its strategy. He believes that a firm can achieve a competitive advantage by choosing to differentiate its product or to compete on price.\nA competitive advantage is when a firm can do something that other firms in the same industry cannot do. For example, if a firm is the only one in its industry to use a new technology, that firm may have a competitive advantage.\nMichael Porter has also written about competitive strategy. However, he does not believe that a firm can achieve a competitive advantage by differentiation or by competing on price. Porter believes that a competitive advantage can be gained by choosing to differentiate a product or to compete on price, but that these strategies do not, in and of themselves, create a competitive advantage.\nAccording to Porter, a competitive advantage can only be gained by being the lowest-cost producer in an industry. A firm that is the lowest-cost producer in its industry will always be able to sell its product for less than other firms in the industry.\nHenry Mintzberg has written about strategy in terms of a firm's synthesis of various elements. Mintzberg believes that a firm's competitive strategy is just one part of its overall strategy. He argues that a firm's strategy is defined by the complex interrelationships among the various elements of the firm.\nPeter Drucker has written about how a firm can use a \"business concept\" to achieve a competitive advantage. A business concept is a clear, simple statement of how a firm will make money. According to Drucker, a business concept is the foundation of a firm's competitive strategy."}

They examine how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are affected by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.\nThe terms attitude and behavior are important in social psychology. An attitude is a feeling that helps an individual evaluate something or someone. An attitude affects a person's behavior. Behavior is how a person acts.\nTwo theories in social psychology are Classical Conditioning and Operant Conditioning. These two theories examine how people learn.\nClassical Conditioning: This theory, developed by Ivan Pavlov, explains how a person's behavior is affected by the association of an object or event with a stimulus that naturally triggers a response. In Pavlov's famous experiment, he rang a bell before giving a dog food. The dog eventually started to salivate in response to the bell.\nOperant Conditioning: This theory, developed by B. F. Skinner, explains how a person's behavior is affected by the consequences of that behavior. The consequences, which are called rewards and punishments, can be either positive or negative. A reward is something that is desired. A punishment is something that is not desired. In a Skinner experiment, a rat presses a lever to receive a food reward. The rat is more likely to press the lever again in the future."}

This view, called rational choice theory, assumes that people make the best possible decision based on the information they have. However, research by psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky has shown that people are prone to many different thinking errors and biases. As a result, decision making is not always a rational process.\nInstinctive decision making is based on the mind's implicit, or unconscious, processes. These processes can produce quick, gut-level reactions that may or may not be based on conscious reasoning.\nIntuitive decision making is similar to instinctive decision making, but it involves unconscious processing that is based on previous conscious experience."}

This model is closely linked with the scientific management principles of Taylor and the contingency model of Fiedler.\nThe rational goal model assumes that managers have a clear understanding of their goals and the goals of their organization. To achieve these goals, managers identify specific actions that can be taken. These actions are then evaluated on the basis of their potential effectiveness and feasibility.\nThe model focuses on productivity and efficiency. It suggests that organizations should set specific goals and establish procedures to achieve those goals. This approach is generally associated with the following characteristics:\nProductivity: A focus on productivity and efficiency is a key element of the rational goal model. This approach is designed to make the most efficient use of resources.\nContinuous improvement: The rational goal model encourages managers to continuously evaluate and improve their approaches.\nData-driven decision making: The model emphasizes the use of data and facts in the decision-making process."}
