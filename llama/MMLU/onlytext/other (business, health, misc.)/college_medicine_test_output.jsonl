{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The placebo effect is a well-known phenomenon, but the mechanism is not yet fully understood.

When you flex a muscle, the muscle fibers use energy from ATP to change shape. This change in shape is how muscles produce force.\nThe process of muscle contraction involves several steps. One of these steps is the power stroke, which is fueled by ATP. During the power stroke, myosin grabs onto an actin filament and pulls it toward the center of the sarcomere.\nAnother important process is the release of calcium ions. Calcium ions bind to troponin, which is attached to the actin filament. This binding causes the troponin to move and expose the binding sites on the actin filament. Myosin can then attach to the actin filament and produce force.\nThe interaction between myosin and actin is involved in both muscle contraction and muscle relaxation. When ATP is used up, the myosin lets go of the actin filament. This allows the muscle to relax.\nThe interaction between tropomyosin and troponin does not use ATP. Instead, it happens automatically when calcium ions are present. This interaction is called the calcium-troponin interaction."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, what would be an important thing for a person to do after sauna use?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shower in cold water."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exercise."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eat a meal."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Replenish fluids with filtered water."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": ""}

The body can use two types of carbohydrates as energy: glycogen and glucose.\nGlycogen is a store of carbohydrates that is found in the muscles and liver. When the body needs energy, it can use glycogen for fuel.\nGlucose is a type of carbohydrate that is found in food. When you eat food that contains carbohydrates, your body breaks down the carbohydrates into glucose. Your body can use glucose for energy immediately or store it in the liver for later use.\nHow does the body use carbohydrates as energy during exercise?\nDuring exercise, the body uses carbohydrates as fuel for muscles. The body uses glycogen for fuel when you are resting. But during exercise, the body breaks down muscle tissue and converts it into glucose for fuel.\nWhether the body can use muscle tissue as fuel during exercise depends on the intensity and duration of the exercise. In general, the body can use muscle tissue as fuel during high-intensity exercise and exercise that lasts for a long time."}

This energy is in the form of a molecule called ATP.\nThere are three main steps in cellular respiration:\n1. A eukaryotic cell's digestive vacuoles breaks down organic compounds such as glucose.\n2. The breakdown products are transferred into the cytoplasm.\n3. Up in the cytoplasm, cellular respiration occurs. Cellular respiration involves many different enzymes and pathways. One of the last steps in cellular respiration is the electron transport chain. This is where ATP is produced.\nThe electron transport chain is made up of proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane. During cellular respiration, electrons are passed from one protein to another in the electron transport chain. This passes electrons down the chain. At the end of the chain, electrons are picked up by an oxygen molecule. This forms a toxic molecule called an superoxide.\nThe superoxide is reacted with an another molecule, forming a molecule called a hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is an harmful substance, so cells have enzymes to break it down. When hydrogen peroxide is broken down, it releases the oxygen that the electrons were passed down to. The oxygen can then be used to create ATP.\nIf the final enzyme in the electron transport chain is blocked, no electrons can pass through. This blocks the production of ATP. When this happens, an organism will die.\nSOLUTION: A substance that acts by binding to cytochrome oxidase A3, the final enzyme in the electron transport chain, would block the production of ATP. The cell\u2019s electron transport chain can no longer move electrons down the chain. No ATP can be produced."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nThe review article sources a lot of data from Finland population studies, where the incidence of sauna use is substantially higher than most countries.

Creatine resynthesis is the process of making new creatine from creatine and phosphate. This process happens during recovery after exercise.\nWhen you use creatine for energy, it breaks apart into creatine and phosphate. Then, your body uses the energy to perform work. After the work is done, the creatine and phosphate can be put back together to form creatine. This is called creatine resynthesis.\nDuring recovery, your muscles use more energy to return to their normal state. They need more creatine for energy. To get this creatine, your muscles can resynthesize creatine from creatine and phosphate.\nA lack of oxygen during exercise is called hypoxia. Hypoxia can prevent creatine resynthesis from happening as quickly as it should. When this happens, your muscles have less creatine for energy.\nSOLUTION: A lack of oxygen during exercise inhibits creatine resynthesis. Your muscles need oxygen to resynthesize creatine from creatine and phosphate. If there is a lack of oxygen, your muscles cannot get the oxygen they need to resynthesize creatine."}

In a thin layer chromatography experiment, a small amount of the mixture is placed on a thin layer of adsorbent material. The adsorbent material is usually a solid layer of fine, porous material such as silica gel, alumina, or cellulose. The mixture is then allowed to spread out into a thin layer.\nThe different components of the mixture have different types of interactions with the adsorbent material. Some components will stick strongly to the adsorbent material and not move once the solvent is added. Other components will stick to the adsorbent material, but will also be drawn into the solvent. The amount of interaction that each component has with the adsorbent material and solvent is what causes the components to move at different rates.\nThe distance that each component moves, called the Rf value, is a measure of the amount of interaction that each component has with the adsorbent material and solvent. The Rf value is determined by comparing the distance that the component has moved with the distance that a reference substance has moved. The reference substance is a substance that is known to have an Rf value.\nSOLUTION: The reactants have an Rf value that is significantly lower than the products. This tells you that the products have a higher type of interaction with the adsorbent material and solvent than the reactants.\nOne type of interaction that affects the Rf value is the ability of a substance to dissolve in the solvent. A substance that can dissolve in the solvent will be moved farther than a substance that cannot dissolve in the solvent.\nThis tells you that the products must have dissolved in the solvent.

The membrane potential is affected by the flow of ions across the membrane.\nWhen the membrane potential reaches a certain value, called the threshold potential, ions are able to flow across the membrane. This flow of ions can stimulate the neuron to send a signal.\nThe movement of ions across the membrane is affected by the difference in electrical charge across the membrane. The charge on the inside of the membrane is higher than the charge on the outside of the membrane.\nThis difference in charge creates an electrical potential difference across the membrane. The electrical potential difference is called the membrane potential.\nThe membrane potential can be changed by the movement of ions across the membrane. When the membrane potential becomes more negative, the neuron is ready to send a signal.\nThe graph below shows how the membrane potential changes over time. The vertical axis shows the membrane potential. The horizontal axis shows time.\nThe graph shows that the membrane potential becomes more negative as the neuron is stimulated. When the membrane potential reaches about -55 millivolts, the neuron is ready to send a signal.\nThe graph also shows that the membrane potential becomes less negative after the neuron is stimulated. This repolarization of the membrane potential is necessary for the neuron to recover and prepare for the next signal.\nSOLUTION: The second shock is characterized by the same change in membrane potential as the first shock.

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nWhich of the following is a likely paragraph that follows this excerpt in the article?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A paragraph on a protein that facilitates intracellular function in response to heat."}, {"label": "B", "text": "A paragraph on increased heart attacks in Eskimo populations."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A recap of Finland\u2019s water polo team excellence."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A study on rats exposed to high levels of heat."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When you read an article or a text, you can create an outline of the main ideas to help you understand the content.

Enzymes work by binding to specific substrates. The enzyme and substrate then combine to form an enzyme-substrate complex.\nIn the complex, the enzyme and substrate are in the proper orientation to be acted upon by chemical bonds. When the chemical bonds break, the enzyme and substrate separate. The enzyme is then free to bind to another substrate and catalyze another reaction.\nSome enzymes have an allosteric site, or a different binding site, where a small molecule can bind. When this small molecule binds to the allosteric site, it can change the activity of the enzyme. This type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition.\nInhibitors that bind to the enzymes substrate complex are called uncompetitive inhibitors. These inhibitors reduce the amount of active enzyme by binding to the enzyme-substrate complex. This reduces the amount of enzyme available to bind to more substrates.\nInhibitors that bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme are called noncompetitive inhibitors. These inhibitors change the enzyme's activity by binding to the allosteric site. This can increase or decrease the enzyme's activity, depending on the inhibitor.\nSOLUTION: Increasing the substrate concentration would have no effect on the impact of uncompetitive inhibitor and increasing impact of noncompetitive inhibitor. These effects would still occur.\nHowever, increasing the substrate concentration would decrease the impact of uncompetitive inhibitor.

When calcium ions bind to troponin, they change the troponin complex, causing the proteins to move and expose the myosin binding sites on the actin. This exposure allows the myosin to bind to the actin and form cross bridges.\nOnce the myosin is attached to the actin, the myosin can change shape and pull the actin toward the myosin. This contraction of the actin and myosin is called the contractile process."}

Your muscles use energy from the food you eat to keep working.\nThe energy from food is in the form of a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Your muscles use ATP to power the signals that make your muscles contract.\nWhen you exercise, your muscles use up ATP quickly. To replace the ATP, your body uses food to break down ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphoric acid. This reaction forms ATP, which can be used as energy.\nThis process happens easily while you are warming up or exercising at a low intensity.

An action potential can be thought of as a short-lasting, near-membrane change in the electrical potential that results from the flow of ions in and out of the neuron.\nAn action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential, which is a low voltage. The threshold potential is triggered by a depolarization, a small change in the electrical potential that results from the flow of ions into the neuron.\nOnce an action potential is initiated, the voltage in the axon rapidly rises to the resting potential, a high voltage. This rapid rise is called a spike. The spike is followed by a slower repolarization, or voltage change, that returns the voltage to the resting potential.\nThe flow of ions into the neuron during the spike depolarizes the membrane. The flow of ions out of the neuron during the repolarization repolarizes the membrane.\nThe neuron can control the flow of ions by opening and closing ion channels. Ion channels are gates that can be opened or closed.

They are also not safe. When you restrict calories for a long time, your body will change how it uses food. You will slow down your metabolism, or the rate at which you use calories. This can make you gain weight when you are no longer restricting your calories.\nA better approach is to use a balanced plan for adding and subtracting calories. A balanced plan does not require you to avoid certain foods or food groups. It does not require you to eat extremely small portions.\nYou can use a balanced plan to add calories to your diet. For example, you can eat more calories by having larger portions or by having a snack.\nYou can use a balanced plan to subtract calories from your diet. For example, you can eat fewer calories by having smaller portions or by skipping a snack.\nSOLUTION: Hide snack food out of sight within his house is a restrictive method. It can be a sign that the wrestler is restricting his calories too much. This is not a good method to restrict his caloric intake.\nThe other three choices are not good methods to restrict caloric intake, either.\nStudy at a health smoothie store instead of a coffee shop is not a good method. A health smoothie store can have high-calorie smoothies.\nReward himself with a savory meal every Saturday for meeting his calorie goals is not a good method. This method can lead to binge eating. Binge eating is eating a very large amount of food in a short period of time.\nSnap himself with a rubber band when he eats a high calorie snack is a restrictive method.

When the level of a substance is too high, the body will increase the rate of production, and when the level is too low, the body will decrease the rate of production.\nThe hypothalamus is the control center for many body functions, including the stress response. When the hypothalamus senses that the body is under stress, it releases a chemical called corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). CRF stimulates the release of another hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH, in turn, triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that helps the body respond to stress.\nAfter a stressful event ends, cortisol levels in the body start to decrease. When cortisol levels decrease, they cause the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). This negative feedback loop helps keep the level of cortisol in the body within a normal range.\nSOLUTION: The hypothalamus controls the stress response of the body by releasing CRF, which leads to eventual release of cortisol, the body\u2019s stress hormone, systemically. This trigger is eventually suppressed by which mechanism?\nThe trigger is suppressed by a negative feedback loop of cortisol. When cortisol levels increase in response to stress, they cause the release of CRF. This CRF, in turn, triggers the release of ACTH. The high levels of ACTH then increase the levels of cortisol in the body. But as cortisol levels increase, they suppress the release of CRF and ACTH. This decrease in CRF and ACTH levels leads to a decrease in cortisol levels. So, the negative feedback loop helps keep the level of cortisol in the body within a normal range."}

Symbols are words, images, or other representations that stand for ideas or experiences.\nHumans learn about their world through symbolic culture. We learn the rules for a game by studying the symbols that represent them. We learn about history by studying the symbols that represent past events.\nThe transmission of symbolic culture requires a community of people who share a set of symbols and understandings. For this reason, symbolic culture is often used within a community.\nThe transmission of symbolic culture can be formal or informal.\nIn a formal transmission, one person acts as the teacher and the others as the students. Formal transmissions can occur in schools, but they also occur in apprenticeship situations, where an experienced person teaches a new person the skills of a trade.\nIn an informal transmission, people learn from each other as they go about their daily lives. Many of the symbols and understandings that make up a culture are learned in this way."}
{"question": "One of the many reasons that the eukaryotic cell can possess so much information in its DNA is the ability to condense coding regions when they are not being expressed. When acting on DNA, which of the following processes will usually lead to a decrease in gene expression?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increased histone acetyltransferase activity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Decrease in histone deacetyltransferase activity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increase in methylation activity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increase in heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Histone proteins are part of the chromatin structure that helps package DNA into a compact form. Changes in the chromatin structure can affect gene expression.\nThe nucleus of a cell contains a complex mixture of DNA, histone proteins, and other proteins. This mixture is called chromatin. The chromatin can be loosely coiled, a state called euchromatin, or tightly coiled, a state called heterochromatin.\nEuchromatin is associated with actively expressing genes and has lower levels of methylation and acetylation. Heterochromatin is associated with silenced genes and has higher levels of methylation and acetylation.\nWhen a gene is expressed, its coding sequence is transcribed into mRNA. The mRNA can then be translated into a protein. But before a gene is transcribed, its coding sequence must be unlocked from the chromatin structure.\nThis unlocking is called transcription. Histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetyltransferase enzymes help regulate gene expression by controlling the acetylation of histone proteins.\nHistone acetyltransferase activity increases the acetylation of histone proteins. Histone deacetyltransferase activity decreases the acetylation of histone proteins.\nMethylation activity adds methyl groups to DNA. Methylation can help protect DNA from damage and can help regulate gene expression.\nIncreased methylation activity increases the methylation of DNA. Decreased methylation activity decreases the methylation of DNA.\nIncreased histone deacetyltransferase activity and decreased histone acetyltransferase activity both decrease the acetylation of histone proteins. But increased histone deacetyltransferase activity additionally decreases the acetylation of non-histone proteins. These non-histone proteins can include proteins that regulate gene expression.\nSo, increased histone deacetyltransferase activity and decreased histone acetyltransferase activity have opposite effects on gene expression. Increased histone deacetyltransferase activity leads to decreased gene expression."}

{"question": "How many electrons does gold (Au) possess that have a quantum number l = 2?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "9"}, {"label": "B", "text": "23"}, {"label": "C", "text": "29"}, {"label": "D", "text": "79"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The number of electrons in an atom is equal to its atomic number. An atom's electronic configuration, or arrangement of its electrons, is determined by its atomic number and the shells that the electrons occupy.\nThe shells are regions in an atom in which the electrons are arranged. An atom's shells are determined by the distance of the electrons' orbits from the atomic nucleus. The distance is shown in the picture below, where the distance from the nucleus is shown by the number of space units.\nThe electronic configuration of an atom is a description of the arrangement of the electron orbits in the atom. An electronic configuration is written using symbols for the chemical elements and numbers for the electron orbits. The symbols are shown in the picture below.\nThe numbers in an electronic configuration are called place values. An electron in the highest occupyable orbit has a place value of 1. An electron in a lower orbit has a place value of 2. And so on.\nFor example, the electronic configuration of the neon atom is written as 2s^2 2p^2. This configuration is described as follows:\nThe two electrons in the 2s orbital have a place value of 1.\nThe two electrons in the 2p orbital have a place value of 2.\nThe electronic configuration of a helium atom is written as 1s^2. This configuration is described as follows:\nThe one electron in the 1s orbital has a place value of 1.\nThe electronic configuration of a chlorine atom is written as 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6. This configuration is described as follows:\nThe two electrons in the 1s orbital have a place value of 1.\nThe two electrons in the 2s orbital have a place value of 1.\nThe six electrons in the 2p orbitals have a place value of 2.\nSOLUTION: The easiest way to determine the number of electrons an atom has is to know the atomic number of the atom. The atomic number tells you the number of electrons in an atom.\nFor gold, the atomic number is 79. So, the gold atom has 79 electrons.\nTo determine the number of electrons in a gold atom with a quantum number l = 2, use the following rules:\nAn atom's electronic configuration is determined by its atomic number and the shells that the electrons occupy.\nThe electrons in a particular shell can be described by their principal quantum number, or quantum number l. The principal quantum number tells you the distance of the electron's orbit from the atomic nucleus.\nThe first quantum number, l = 0, describes the innermost orbit. This orbit is closest to the atomic nucleus.\nThe second quantum number, l = 1, describes the next orbit. This orbit is farther from the nucleus than the innermost orbit.\nThe third quantum number, l = 2, describes the next orbit. This orbit is still farther from the nucleus than the second orbit.\nAnd so on.\nSo, the quantum number l = 2 describes the second orbit from the atomic nucleus. This orbit contains two electrons.\nSince the gold atom has 79 electrons, the gold atom has 77 electrons in its first 2 shells. The remaining two electrons are in the 3rd shell.\nTherefore, the gold atom's electronic configuration is 79."}
{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nAccording to the article, which of the following is NOT a benefit of sauna use?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decreased risk of heart attacks."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increase in stroke volume."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Improved mental health."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decreased rate of erectile dysfunction."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": ""}

Before a cell divides, it must replicate its DNA and pass one copy of the DNA to each daughter cell. This process is necessary for the cell to have the genetic material it needs to function.\nDuring DNA replication, mistakes are possible. Mistakes can occur in the genetic material that is passed from parents to children. When mistakes occur, they can have two types of effects:\nThe type of effect depends on the type of mistake that is made. There are four types of mistakes that can occur during DNA replication:\nA thymine (T) is substituted for an adenine (A).\nA adenine (A) is substituted for a thymine (T).\nA thymine (T) is inserted into the DNA.\nA cytosine (C) is inserted into the DNA.\nMismatch repair mechanism: This mechanism repairs mistakes in the base pairs that are not complementary. In other words, it repairs the mistakes that occur when an adenine is not paired with a thymine, or when a cytosine is not paired with a guanine.\nDuring this process, the enzymes find and remove any incorrect bases. Then, the enzymes add the correct bases to the DNA.\nEndonuclease repair: This mechanism repairs large tears in the DNA.\nIf the DNA backbone is broken, the enzymes will remove the damaged part of the DNA and add new nucleotides to the broken ends. The cell will then use the undamaged DNA as a template to rebuild the missing part of the DNA.\nDNA polymerase I and DNA polymerase III: DNA polymerase is the enzyme that adds new nucleotides to the DNA. DNA polymerase I and DNA polymerase III are two types of enzymes that can unite to form a complex that repairs mistakes.\nIf DNA polymerase notes a mistake during replication, it can remove the incorrect base and start over. This is called proofreading.\nIf an incorrect base has been inserted into the DNA, but not bonded to its correct base, the base can be removed by the DNA polymerase.\nEndonuclease repair and mismatch repair mechanism are the two main ways to repair mistakes. Which method is used depends on the type of mistake that is made.\nSOLUTION: Mistakes are coded into the leading strand about once every 100,000/1 million copies.
