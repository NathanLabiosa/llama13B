This difference in neutron count leads to an atom with a different atomic mass. For example, carbon 13 and carbon 14 are stable isotopes of carbon.\nCarbon 13 is common in nature, and carbon 14 is created by cosmic rays. Living organisms cannot tell the difference between carbon 13 and carbon 14, so carbon 14 is a useful tool for studying how matter is cycled through ecosystems.\nWhen a substance is labeled with a stable isotope, the isotope is bonded to the substance. For example, when water is labeled with deuterium, the deuterium becomes a part of that water.\nThe ratio of a stable isotope to a naturally occurring isotope in a substance is called the isotopic ratio. This ratio can be used to track the movement of the substance through an ecosystem.\nSOLUTION: Carbon 13 is the stable isotope that is commonly given for the measurement of total body water.\nWhen your body takes in carbon 13, your body also takes in carbon 12. The carbon 13 and carbon 12 mix in your body. So, the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 in your body is the same as the ratio in the environment.\nYour body does not change the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 as it moves through your body. This means that the isotopic ratio in your body's carbon 13 can be used to calculate the ratio in your body's water."}

Some of these changes are a normal part of aging, while others can be caused by diseases.\nOne of the changes that occurs with increasing age is a reduction in lean body mass. Lean body mass is the body's tissue and organs. After the age of 30, adults lose about 0.5 to 1 percent of their lean body mass each year. This can affect a person's strength and muscle mass.\nA reduction in bone density can also occur with age. Bone density is the measure of how dense your bones are. Bone density decreases with age, and in women, this decrease can lead to osteoporosis. In men, bone density tends to stay the same or increase.\nAn increased appetite is not a normal part of aging.\nImpaired immune function can occur with age.

When considering whether there is a relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels in humans, it is important to examine the possible reasons why the evidence is inconclusive.\nThe mechanism regulating the absorption of cholesterol and its export in lipoproteins is complex. This complexity makes it difficult to determine how much cholesterol is absorbed by the body from the diet.\nThe mechanism controlling the clearance of intestinally derived lipoproteins by the liver is also complex. This complexity makes it difficult to determine how much cholesterol is removed by the liver.\nThe multiple intrahepatic responses to increased cellular cholesterol may also contribute to the inconclusive evidence. Intrahepatic responses are what the liver does to cholesterol it has absorbed.

This process is called digestion.\nThe digestive system is a series of organs and muscles that work together to break down food. As food moves through your digestive system, it is mashed, pierced, and broken apart by the accessory organs. These organs work with the small intestine to absorb the nutrients from the food.\nThe liver helps digest food by producing bile, a fluid that breaks down fats. The bile and the fats are absorbed into the blood by the small intestine.\nThe small intestine is the site of nutrient absorption. The small intestine is lined with millions of microvilli, which are tiny, finger-like projections. The microvilli increase the surface area of the small intestine, giving more absorptive cells more access to food molecules.\nThe accessory organs and the small intestine work together to digest food.\nPancreas: The pancreas is a gland that produces digestive enzymes. The enzymes are released into the small intestine, where they break down nutrients.\nThe pancreas produces enzymes called proteases, which break down proteins from food. The pancreas also produces lipases, which break down fats from food.\nLack of pancreatic amylase: The pancreas also produces amylase, an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates from food. If the pancreas does not produce enough amylase, carbohydrates cannot be digested.\nLack of small intestinal lactase: Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down lactose, a sugar in milk. Most adults have lactase in their small intestine. But some people, including some African Americans and people of Jewish descent, have a genetic condition called lactose intolerance. In lactose intolerance, the small intestine does not produce enough lactase. So, lactose passes through the small intestine and into the large intestine, where it is fermented by bacteria. This fermentation can cause cramping, bloating, gas, and diarrhea.\nLack of small intestinal sucrase-isomaltase: Sucrase and sucrase-isomaltase are enzymes that break down sugars in food. A lack of these enzymes can cause disaccharide intolerance, which can lead to symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea."}
{"question": "Which of the following is the main nitrogenous compound in urine?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Uric acid"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ammonia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Urea"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Creatinine"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: One of the main functions of the kidneys is to remove waste products from your blood. Each day, your kidneys filter about 150 quarts of blood. They also produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine.\nOne of the main nitrogenous waste products in your blood is urea. Urea is formed when your liver processes ammonia, a waste product of metabolism. Your kidneys then filter urea from your blood and remove it from your body in your urine.\nAnother nitrogenous waste product in your blood is uric acid. Uric acid is formed from the breakdown of purines, which are nitrogen-rich compounds that are found in many foods.\nYour kidneys also filter uric acid from your blood and remove it from your body in your urine.\nBut urea and uric acid are too large to be filtered from your blood directly into your urine. Instead, these nitrogenous waste products are combined with other compounds to form urea nitrogen and uric acid, which are smaller and can be filtered out of your blood.\nUrea nitrogen is made by combining urea with ammonia. Urea nitrogen is then excreted from your body in your urine.\nUric acid is made by combining uric acid with a substance called ammonia. This combination, called allantoin, is then excreted from your body in your urine.\nSOLUTION: The main nitrogenous compound in urine is urea. Urea is made by combining urea with ammonia. Urea is then excreted from your body in your urine."}

It is used for individuals who have obesity and are considerably overweight. Bariatric surgery can help a person lose weight by making the stomach smaller or by bypassing part of the intestine.\nThere are several types of bariatric surgery. The three most common types are:\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass: This is the most common type of bariatric surgery. The procedure creates a small pouch from the stomach and connects it to a part of the intestine farther down the digestive tract. This smaller pouch holds less food than the original stomach, so the person feels full sooner. The Roux-en-Y also bypasses a part of the intestine, which means the body absorbs fewer calories from the food.\nAdjustable gastric banding: In this procedure, a band is placed around the stomach to create a small pouch. The band can be adjusted to control how much food the pouch can hold.\nSleeve gastrectomy: This surgery removes a large part of the stomach. The remaining stomach is a sleeve-shaped pouch that is smaller than the original stomach.\nBariatric surgery can help improve many obesity-related health problems, including type 2 diabetes. Some studies have shown that bariatric surgery can lead to a reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. However, the surgery does not always result in complete remission of diabetes."}

One way it does this is by making adjustments to the basal metabolic rate (BMR). The BMR is the rate at which the body uses energy when it is at rest.\nThe BMR is affected by factors such as the body's size and muscle mass. It is also affected by factors such as age, gender, and nutritional state. (A nutritional state is a description of the types and amounts of food a person is consuming.)\nA person's BMR increases with age until they are about 30 years old.

Vitamins are required for many processes in your body, but they do not provide energy. Most vitamins are not used as cofactors in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. But some vitamins are required to attach to enzymes to make them work. The vitamin-enzyme complexes called cofactors are needed by enzymes to catalyze reactions.\nHydroxylation reactions require a cofactor called a hydroxylase. Hydroxylase is an enzyme that uses a hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl group is a molecule that has one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms.\nThree vitamins provide the hydroxylase cofactor:\n1. Niacin: Niacin is vitamin B3. It can be used as a hydroxylase cofactor.\n2. Pantothenic acid: Pantothenic acid is vitamin B5. It can be used as a hydroxylase cofactor.\n3. Vitamin B6: Vitamin B6 is also called pyridoxine. It can be used as a hydroxylase cofactor.\nRiboflavin is a vitamin that is not a hydroxylase cofactor.\nVitamin C is a vitamin that is not a hydroxylase cofactor.\nBiotin is a vitamin that is not a hydroxylase cofactor."}

The type of fuel used during exercise depends on the duration of the exercise.\nDuring short bouts of exercise, muscle glycogen is the primary fuel source. As exercise continues, the body begins to use fat as a fuel source. The amount of fat used depends on the amount of glycogen available in the muscle.\nGlycogen storage is limited, so athletes need to consume carbohydrates to increase their glycogen levels. The liver can store a limited amount of glycogen, and this storage is increased by consuming carbohydrates.\nIntramuscular lipid storage is also limited. Athletes can increase their intramuscular lipid storage by consuming foods high in unsaturated fats, such as fish and nuts.\nSOLUTION: Endurance type exercise training increases muscle glycogen use during exercise. As athletes train, their muscles learn to use glycogen more efficiently."}

One way your body uses nutrients is to convert them into glucose, or sugar.\nWhen you eat, the carbohydrates in your food are broken down into glucose. Glucose is a source of energy for your body. Your cells can use glucose for energy, or they can store glucose for later use.\nYour body can also use fat for energy. When your body breaks down fat, it converts the fat into smaller molecules called fatty acids. Your body can use these fatty acids for energy, just like it can use glucose.\nWhen your body breaks down nutrients from food, some waste products are also formed. One type of waste product is called a ketone body. Your body can use ketone bodies for energy, but it prefers to use glucose.\nSo, the concentration of ketone bodies in your blood can increase if you do not have enough glucose in your body. This can happen if you do not eat enough, or if you have a medical condition that affects your body's ability to use glucose.\nAlanine and non-esterified (free) fatty acids are not as important to the breakdown of nutrients from food as are glucose, ketone bodies, and fatty acids."}

Myelination, the process of covering nerve cells with myelin, a fatty substance that helps nerve cells communicate with each other, is mostly complete by the end of adolescence. Myelin helps nerve cells communicate with each other more efficiently. This process leads to improvements in brain function, including enhanced cognitive function, better coordination of thoughts and behaviors, and more sophisticated problem-solving abilities.\nPeak bone mass occurs before the growth spurt ends. During adolescence, bones increase in density and mineral content. By the end of adolescence, peak bone mass has usually been reached. Peak bone mass is determined by both genetics and environmental factors, including diet and exercise. Children who reach their peak bone mass early and have a high peak bone mass tend to have strong bones as adults.\nGirls physiologically increase their percentage body fat. In adolescence, girls' bodies begin to change in preparation for potential pregnancy. Girls' bodies gain weight, and their hips widen. The percentage of body fat increases. These changes are driven by hormones such as estrogen.\nType 2 obesity-related diabetes remains a very rare problem. In the past, most children with type 2 diabetes were overweight. But in recent years, many children with type 2 diabetes are not overweight. This has happened as more children are developing type 2 diabetes, a condition that may be related to the rise in obesity and the lack of physical activity."}

Today, many people live in cities. As people's incomes rise, they buy more food. The types of food people buy often depend on their cultural background and the foods they have access to.\nSome foods, such as grains and vegetables, are now being produced on a massive scale. This is because they can be transported over long distances and do not spoil quickly. Other foods, such as fruits and vegetables, do not keep well and are usually eaten soon after they are harvested.\nMany people believe that they should eat more fruits and vegetables, but these foods are often more expensive than other foods. In fact, many people in the world do not have access to a wide variety of foods.\nSOLUTION: On a global scale, trends are suggesting that with rising incomes and urbanization, people are eating more meat and dairy products. These foods are good sources of protein and calcium. But they are also high in fat and can be dangerous for people to eat in excess."}

Proteins are used to build and repair tissues, and they also help to maintain growth and immunity.\nThe quality of the protein in a food determines how well it can be used by the body. Protein quality is evaluated by assessing the ratio of usable protein to total protein in a food.\nOne method of evaluating protein quality is the protein efficiency ratio (PER). In the PER assay, rats are fed a diet that contains a mixture of two proteins. One of the proteins is a high-quality protein, and the other is a low-quality protein. The rats' growth and nitrogen use are measured after they are fed the diet for several weeks.\nThe PER is calculated by dividing the animal's weight gain on the high-quality protein by its weight gain on the low-quality protein. The PER is a measure of the animal's ability to use the high-quality protein compared to the low-quality protein.\nAnother method of evaluating protein quality is the net protein utilisation (NPU) assay. In the NPU assay, the rats' nitrogen balance is measured after they are fed a diet that contains a mixture of two proteins. One of the proteins is a high-quality protein, and the other is a low-quality protein. The NPU is a measure of the animal's ability to use the high-quality protein compared to the low-quality protein.\nThe NPU assay is considered the best method for evaluating protein quality in human nutrition.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nAnimal growth assays, such as the PER assay, can underestimate the quality of dietary proteins for human nutrition.

This release of triglycerides into the bloodstream is important for supplying the body's cells with energy.\nSome of the triglycerides are eventually delivered to cells, where they are broken down and used for energy.\nThe rest of the triglycerides are returned to the liver, where they are cleared from the body.\nCholesterol in chylomicrons is also returned to the liver. The liver removes cholesterol from the chylomicrons and uses it to build new chylomicrons.\nSome of the cholesterol in the new chylomicrons is released into the bloodstream. This release of cholesterol into the bloodstream is important for maintaining the body's cholesterol balance.\nExcess cholesterol in the bloodstream is cleared from the body by removing it from the circulation. This removal is important to avoid the buildup of cholesterol in the blood vessels."}

This transfer is enabled by an enzyme called a DNA methyltransferase. There are three main types of DNA methyltransferases: DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b.\nMethylation is the addition of a methyl group to DNA. Methyl groups can be added to DNA by a process called methylation. This process is called DNA methylation.\nMethylation can alter the behavior of a gene. For example, methylation can cause a gene to be turned off. This can be useful because it allows cells to temporarily silence a gene when it is not needed.\nMethylation can also be passed down through families. DNA methylation patterns can be changed in cells, but this does not usually happen in body cells. Instead, these patterns are passed down through families. This form of methylation does not require an enzyme.\nSOLUTION: DNMT1 is responsible for copying methylation marks from the parental to the daughter strand of DNA during replication.\nDNMT1 is the most common DNA methyltransferase in mammalian cells. It is involved in maintaining methylation patterns as cells divide."}

Cells do not have a power source of their own. Instead, they get their energy from enzymes. Enzymes are protein molecules that can perform chemical reactions without being used up.\nCells use enzymes to change food into energy. This process is called cellular respiration. Cellular respiration provides the energy that a cell needs to function.\nCellular respiration involves many different reactions. One of the first steps in cellular respiration is glycolysis. Glycolysis is a reaction that breaks down sugar into a simpler sugar.\nThe breakdown of sugar in glycolysis releases energy that is used by the cell. The release of energy unlocks the energy that is stored in sugar. This energy can be used by the cell to perform work.\nAnother part of cellular respiration is the citric acid cycle, or Krebs cycle. The citric acid cycle breaks down the simple sugar produced in glycolysis. This process releases energy that is used by the cell.\nThe citric acid cycle produces a number of different chemicals. One of these chemicals is called acetyl-CoA.\nAcetyl-CoA is a key chemical in cellular respiration. It moves through a series of reactions called the electron transport chain. The electron transport chain is in the membranes of the mitochondria and the chloroplasts.\nThe electron transport chain transfers energy to a molecule called ATP. ATP is a type of chemical energy. ATP is called an energy currency because it is used to power many cellular processes.\nWhen acetyl-CoA reaches the end of the electron transport chain, it has a large amount of energy.

Which of the following is correct?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Consumption of a meal leads to suppression of lipase activity within adipose tissue leading to a decrease in plasma NEFA concentrations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin and therefore is most active following meal consumption"}, {"label": "C", "text": "During the postprandial period the VLDL synthesis pathway is suppressed in favour of hydrolysis of chylomicrons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All options given are correct"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The digestive system breaks food down into smaller molecules of nutrients that can be absorbed and used for energy. The body absorbs many of these nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, by using the bloodstream. The digestive system absorbs many nutrients, but some nutrients, such as fat, need to be broken down into smaller molecules before they can be absorbed.\nFat digestion and absorption occur in the small intestine. The small intestine absorbs fat into the bloodstream as chylomicrons, which are large, triglyceride-rich particles.\nInsulin is a hormone that helps regulate the body's use of fat and sugar. When the pancreas, a gland near the stomach, releases insulin into the bloodstream, it causes the body's cells to take in sugar from the bloodstream. Insulin also signals the liver to convert unused sugar and stored fat into sugar.\nAfter a meal, the concentration of circulating NEFA (triglycerides) in the blood decreases. This decrease is due to a combination of reabsorption by the liver and utilization by muscle and other tissues. The liver receives about 75% of the postprandial NEFA via the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the intestine to the liver."}

But as the world population has increased, more and more people have moved to cities. Unlike rural residents, city dwellers do not grow their own food. They must buy it.\nBecause they have no farm to grow their own food, city people are more vulnerable to food price increases. When food prices go up, poor city people may not be able to afford to buy enough food. This can lead to malnutrition and even starvation.\nSOLUTION: Poor city people are more vulnerable to food price increases than poor rural people. So, urbanisation will make it more difficult to eradicate hunger and malnutrition."}

In catabolic reactions, glucose is broken down into smaller molecules such as pyruvate.\nGlycolysis breaks down glucose and releases energy. This process can occur in all cells.\nGluconeogenesis is the opposite of glycolysis. It is the process by which cells make glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. Gluconeogenesis can occur in the liver and in other cells.\nAerobic metabolism is a process that uses oxygen to metabolise glucose. Aerobic metabolism can produce more energy than anaerobic metabolism. The breakdown of glucose by aerobic metabolism produces carbon dioxide and water.\nAnaerobic metabolism is a process that does not use oxygen to metabolise glucose. Anaerobic metabolism can produce energy, but it does not produce as much energy as aerobic metabolism. The breakdown of glucose by anaerobic metabolism produces carbon dioxide, water, and an acid called lactic acid."}

Here are some of the effects:\nFood is now produced in one part of the world and consumed in another. This global distribution of food means that food security is now a global issue. For example, if food prices go up in one part of the world, that affects food security throughout the world.\nNew food production techniques and new crop types have been developed in recent years. These techniques and crop types have increased the amount of food that can be grown. But they have also changed the types of food that are available. This change can affect food security, as people may not want to eat foods that are new to them.\nThe movement of people from farms to cities has changed the way food is produced and distributed. More food is now produced on a smaller number of larger farms. And most food is now transported long distances to market. These changes have affected food security by changing the way food is grown, distributed, and priced.\nThe increase in world trade has made food available from all over the world. But trade barriers and subsidies have also influenced the prices and availability of food. Trade barriers can make it difficult for farmers in developing countries to sell their products to consumers in other countries. And subsidies can make it difficult for farmers in developing countries to compete with farmers in wealthier countries.\nAdapted from material provided by the World Bank.\nSOLUTION: Wealthy countries subsidies and trade barriers make it difficult for developing countries to take advantage of the potential of globalisation for advancing food security.\nDeveloping countries need to create publicly-owned food reserves in order to realise the potential benefits."}

Each method has its own limitations, but bioelectrical impedance is the most convenient and accessible.\nBioelectrical impedance measures how well electricity flows through your body. Impedance increases when cells contain more water. So, the body's impedance can be used to estimate body composition.\nBecause muscle contains more water than fat and muscle weighs less than fat, an electrical current will travel farther and faster through muscle than through fat.\nSOLUTION: Muscle contains less water than fat, so muscle has a lower impedance than fat. An electrical current will travel faster through muscle than through fat."}

{"question": "Which of the following will provide the main fuel for muscle contraction during short-term intense activity such as sprinting?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Muscle triacylglycerol"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Plasma free fatty acids"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Plasma triacylglycerol in VLDL"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Muscle glycogen"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Muscle cells can use both triacylglycerols and glycogen as fuels. But when you need energy for short-term, intense physical activity, your muscle cells can produce more energy from plasma free fatty acids and muscle triacylglycerols than from muscle glycogen.\nThis happens because plasma free fatty acids and muscle triacylglycerols can be broken down quickly into usable energy. Muscle glycogen is stored in the muscles with water. When your muscle cells need energy, they must break down muscle glycogen and use it to produce energy. This process requires water, which is why your muscles can also produce a lot of energy from muscle glycogen during short-term, intense physical activity.\nSOLUTION: Your muscle cells will use plasma free fatty acids as the main fuel for muscle contraction during short-term intense activity. This fuel is produced from the breakdown of triacylglycerols in your body's fat cells."}

In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. As a result, people with type 1 diabetes are no longer able to produce insulin.\nType 2 diabetes is also an autoimmune disorder. However, type 2 diabetes usually occurs in adults and is more common in people who are overweight. In type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to insulin. This means that the body needs more insulin to keep blood sugar levels normal. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes may not be able to produce enough insulin to keep their blood sugar levels normal.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nAutoimmune factors are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 but not type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. In type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to insulin.\nPersons with type 1 diabetes rapidly develop chronic complications. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes involve the same metabolic pathways and share many of the same complications.\nPersons with type 1 diabetes can increase endogenous insulin production by taking oral hypoglycemic agents.

The enzymes and juices mix with food that is in the stomach. The digestive enzymes and juices break down the food into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules can be absorbed by the body.\nThe stomach releases enzymes and juices called pepsinogen and gastric lipase into the lumen of the stomach. The lumen is the space within the stomach. Pepsinogen and gastric lipase mix with food in the lumen. In the presence of stomach acid, pepsinogen is converted to pepsin. Pepsin breaks down proteins from the food. Gastric lipase breaks down fats from the food.\nThe stomach has two main types of cells. One type of cell is called a parietal cell. Parietal cells secrete stomach acid and a digestive enzyme called pepsin. The other type of cell is called a chief cell. Chief cells secrete a hormone called gastrin. Gastrin stimulates parietal cells to produce stomach acid and pepsin.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nThe vagus nerve is a cranial nerve. It is involved in many body functions, including digestion. One function of the vagus nerve is to inhibit acid secretion by the stomach after a meal has been consumed.

In a nitrogen balance study, the subject consumes a diet containing a specific amount of protein. The study measures the subject's nitrogen intake and loss and uses this information to determine the subject's protein requirement.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is B.\nAdaptation is fully accounted for in the design of nitrogen balance studies.\nThe adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of N-balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization.\nThe adaptive metabolic demand refers to the body's ability to adapt to changes in protein intake. This adaptation can affect the results of nitrogen balance studies. But the design of these studies takes adaptation into account. So, the slope of N-balance studies is an accurate measure of the efficiency of protein utilization.\nVariable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD.\nThe safe individual protein requirement is the protein requirement, as determined by nitrogen balance studies. This requirement takes into account the adaptive metabolic demand and the individual's needs.\nAdaptation should not influence the interpretation of N-balance studies.\nAdaptation does not affect the design of nitrogen balance studies. So, it does not affect the interpretation of these studies."}

De novo fatty acid synthesis is the process by which acetyl-CoA is cleaved into two parts: coenzyme A and a fatty acid. These parts are then used to make other molecules, such as phospholipids and triglycerides.\nDe novo fatty acid synthesis is usually initiated by an excess of fat intake, an excess of energy yielding substrates, or prolonged fasting. When you eat more fat than you need, or when your body uses more energy-yielding substances than it needs, the excess is converted into acetyl-CoA, which is then converted into fatty acids. This can also happen when you do not eat for a while."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nTranscription is the process by which an organism's genes are turned into mRNA. During transcription, the cell uses the template provided by a gene to create an mRNA molecule. The mRNA molecule obtains its information from the gene that was transcribed.\nAn mRNA molecule is formed when the two strands of a DNA molecule are used to create a single strand of mRNA. This single strand of mRNA contains the information that will be used to build the parts of an organism.\nIn some cases, the mRNA molecule must be further processed before it can be used to build parts of an organism. RNA splicing is a type of further processing. During splicing, the cell removes introns\u2014sections of the mRNA molecule that do not contain information for building parts of an organism. The cell then combines the remaining exons\u2014sections of the mRNA molecule that do contain information\u2014to form a mature mRNA molecule.\nSOLUTION: The correct statement about protein synthesis is:\nB. The mRNA formed by transcription of a region of DNA only contains information for the protein to be synthesised."}
