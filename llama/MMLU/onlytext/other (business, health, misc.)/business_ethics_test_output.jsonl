The model is based on the idea that a company should act in its own best interest, but that its own interest can be served by contributing to the welfare of society.\nThere are several reasons why an organization may choose to act in an socially responsible way:\nA company may be able to get away with unethical behavior, but it is not necessarily in its own best interest to do so. For example, a company that damages the environment may save money in the short term, but it may face higher costs in the long term if the damage affects the company's reputation or leads to environmental legislation.\nSocially responsible behavior can help a company build a positive reputation. This can help attract and retain customers, partners, and employees who are willing to take part in the company's social and environmental initiatives.\nA company that is seen as a good corporate citizen is likely to have an easier time complying with legislation and avoiding lawsuits."}

These rules are called ethical norms. Ethical norms can differ greatly from one culture to another.\nAccording to the text, individuals from low-power-distance cultures view the distribution of power in organizations as more equal than do individuals from high-power-distance cultures. People from low-power-distance cultures expect and prefer that decisions be shared among equals. In high-power-distance cultures, however, power is distributed in a more hierarchical pattern. People from high-power-distance cultures expect and prefer that decisions be made by those in positions of authority.\nSOLUTION: The text argues that individuals engage in moral reasoning in three levels: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional.\nThe preconventional level is based on the idea that the ends justify the means.

This includes the greatest amount of happiness or the greatest amount of good of any kind.\nThe classic example of utilitarianism in action is a medical procedure called the \"greatest good for the greatest number.\" Imagine that there is a limited supply of a vital medical resource, and that there are three people who need it. One of the people is a famous and important person, and the other two are ordinary people.\nAccording to utilitarianism, the supply should be given to the most people, which means that the two ordinary people should each receive a portion of the supply. The famous and important person will survive without the resource, so the greatest good for the greatest number of people is served by letting that person die.\nSOLUTION: The last paragraph of the passage describes utilitarianism. An action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. The greatest amount of happiness is one way to promote the greatest good."}

Sometimes, how a decision or action is described can make it seem better or worse than it really is. This is known as framing.\nFraming can be a form of spin. Spin is a one-sided presentation of an issue that is intended to influence public opinion. George Orwell's book, 1984, introduced the term \"doublethink\" to describe the act of holding two completely opposing thoughts in your mind at the same time. When one of the thoughts is explicitly identified, the other thought is implicitly accepted.\nThe tobacco industry has been known to use spin to create a positive image of tobacco use. For example, instead of saying that smoking is dangerous, they use framing to argue that smoking is a personal choice.\nSOLUTION: Ethical window dressing is the use of language to mask or try to make an action or decision appear better than it really is.\nThe hospital wants to discharge patients as quickly as possible. They call it \"concierge\" service, but it's really just a way to get patients out faster.\nThis is an example of ethical window dressing. The hospital is using a positive term to describe a decision that is not really about giving patients a personal concierge.\nMoral framing is the use of language to describe an action or decision in terms of morality.\nThe CEO of a company decided to lay off many employees to increase the company's profits. But the CEO knew that many of the employees who were laid off had children to support. This is a case of moral framing. The CEO is framing the decision in terms of right and wrong.\nEthical splicing is the use of language to describe an action or decision in terms of ethics.\nA geneticist is deciding whether to use genetic testing to identify people who have a higher risk of a heart condition. This is a case of ethical splicing. The geneticist is framing the decision in terms of what is ethical.\nMoral splicing is the use of language to describe an action or decision in terms of morality.\nA clothing store is selling a line of clothes made by workers who are paid very low wages. The store could argue that it is not its problem, but it is trying to change the world. This is a case of moral splicing. The store is framing its decision in terms of right and wrong."}

Ethics is a field of philosophy that seeks to understand the sources of moral values and the criteria for making ethical decisions.\nMoral theories provide a framework for understanding what is right and wrong. The major moral theories are consequentialism, duty ethics, and virtue ethics.\nConsequentialism: Right and wrong depend on the consequences of an action. The purpose of moral decision making is to find the action that has the best consequences.\nImagine that a person is considering donating money to a charity. This person has two options: donate to a local homeless shelter or donate to a cancer research center. A consequentialist might choose to donate to the cancer research center. This person believes that donating to a cancer research center is more likely to have the best consequences.\nDuty Ethics: Duty ethics is a theory that focuses on the moral rules and obligations that people have. The duty ethics theorist focuses on the rights and wrongs of specific actions, not on the consequences of those actions.\nImagine that the same person is considering whether to keep a promise to a friend. A duty ethics theorist would consider whether the person has an obligation to keep the promise. This theorist would not consider the consequences of keeping the promise.\nVirtue Ethics: Virtue ethics is a theory that focuses on the character of a person. A virtuous person has certain good traits, such as honesty, generosity, and courage. Right and wrong depend on the character of the person.\nImagine that the same person is considering whether to tell a lie to a jealous friend. A virtue ethics theorist would consider whether the lie is a virtuous action. A virtuous person is honest, so a lie is not a virtuous action."}

The concept of CSR suggests that businesses should embrace their responsibilities to society by taking actions that go beyond the law.\nMany businesses choose to adopt CSR as a business strategy because it can help them be more socially and environmentally responsible. In doing so, businesses can improve their reputation, reduce their environmental impact, and improve their relationship with their employees, customers, and communities.\nThere are many ways in which businesses can demonstrate corporate social responsibility. Some businesses choose to adopt sustainable or ethical business practices. Others focus on reducing their negative impact on the environment. Still, others contribute to community development or support philanthropic causes.\nBusiness malpractice, on the other hand, is when a business acts in a way that is illegal, unethical, or otherwise considered wrong.

To understand ethical decision making, it is helpful to divide the factors that impact ethical decision making into two categories: individual factors and situational factors.\nIndividual factors are related to the unique characteristics of a person. These factors can include a person's values, ethics, and personality traits. For example, a person's values may dictate what they believe is right or wrong. A person's ethics, or their understanding of what is acceptable behavior, may also impact their ethical decision making. Personality traits, such as how much a person weighs their own needs against the needs of others, can also impact ethical decision making.\nSituational factors are features of the person's environment or the particular issue they are facing. These factors can include the specific rules and expectations of an organization, the social and cultural context, and the potential outcomes of a decision. For example, the specific rules and expectations of an organization can impact ethical decision making. The social and cultural context can also have an impact. For example, behaviors that are ethical in one culture may not be ethical in another. The potential outcomes of a decision can also impact ethical decision making. A person is likely to weigh the potential outcomes of a decision to determine whether it is ethical.\nSOLUTION: Ethical decision making is impacted by both individual factors and situational factors. Individual factors, such as a person's values, ethics, and personality traits, can impact ethical decision making. Situational factors, such as the specific rules and expectations of an organization, the social and cultural context, and the potential outcomes of a decision, can also impact ethical decision making."}

Virtue ethics says that the best way to live is to develop these traits.\nEthical egoism is the theory that the best action is the one that benefits you the most. This theory is sometimes called selfish. But ethical egoism does not mean that you should always do what you want.

These decisions can be complicated, and there are many ways to approach them.\nOne way to decide is to compare the costs of a decision to its benefits. This is called cost-benefit analysis, and it can be quite complex. For example, a business might want to introduce a new product, but it will take a long time to develop the product and cost a lot of money. The cost-benefit analysis would weigh the expected costs against the expected benefits, such as the amount of money the business expects to make from the new product.\nAnother way to decide is to consider the ethical implications of a decision. For example, a business might want to make a product that is designed to last only a year, but this decision might lead to environmental problems. A consequentialist would consider the potential effects of the decision on other people and the environment. This business might decide to make a product with a longer lifespan, to reduce its environmental impact.\nA third way to decide is to look at the facts and figures of a decision. A business might want to build a factory in an area where the air is already polluted. A rationalized decision would be to build the factory anyway. A business that wants to build the factory might argue that the area already has pollution problems, so adding to them won't make a difference."}
