Unlike other viruses, retroviruses have RNA instead of DNA for their genetic material. They also have an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. This enzyme converts the viral RNA into DNA, which the virus can then integrate into a host's genome.\nThe integration of the viral DNA into the host's genome can have long-term effects on the host. The viral DNA can become part of the host's genes, which can then be passed on to the host's offspring. This is how retroviruses cause diseases like leukaemia in some animals.\nRetroviruses were first discovered in the 1950s. In 1960, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase determined that the poliovirus was an RNA virus. This was the first demonstration that RNA viruses can infect animals.\nIn 1970, Howard Temin proposed the idea that retroviruses can incorporate their RNA into a host's genome. This idea was later proven with the discovery of retroviruses in animals.\nIn the 1980s, scientists discovered many different types of retroviruses. These include human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLVs), which cause T-cell leukemia in humans, and the viruses that cause AIDS.\nSOLUTION: In chickens as Rous sarcoma, chickens with the disease were found to have a retrovirus.

Viruses use the cells of their host organisms to reproduce.\nA virus consists of two parts: a genetic material and a protective protein coat. The genetic material contains the virus's genes, which are passed from parent viruses to progeny viruses. The protective protein coat surrounds the genetic material.\nA virus can have different ways of infecting host cells. A virus may enter a host cell by inserting its proteins into the cell's membrane. This is called a tumor virus. Some viruses may use a virus-specific receptor on the host cell's surface to bind to the cell. This is called a enveloped virus.\nThe genetic material of a virus can be of two types: DNA or RNA. Some viruses have RNA genetic material, and some have DNA genetic material.\nViruses that have RNA genetic material are called RNA viruses. RNA viruses have an RNA polymerase enzyme that can copy the viral RNA into DNA. The DNA copy of the RNA can then be amplified and integrated into the host cell's genome.\nViruses that have DNA genetic material are called DNA viruses. DNA viruses have a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme that can copy the viral DNA into RNA. The RNA copy of the DNA is then translated into proteins that form a new virus particle.\nSOLUTION: Picornavirus replication is typical of RNA viruses. The virion RNA acts as mRNA, and the virion RNA is translated into a single large polyprotein. This polyprotein is later processed into separate polypeptides by viral and cellular proteases."}

{"question": "A case-control study is conducted to assess the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer patients with lung cancer and 100 controls are asked about their past alcohol consumption. According to the study results, alcohol consumption is strongly associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.5). The researchers then divide the study subjects into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Subsequent statistical analysis does not reveal any association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group.

They also choose a group of people without the disease (controls) and look back to see if any factors are associated with the disease.\nIf there is an association with a certain factor, such as smoking and lung cancer, then that factor is said to be statistically associated with the disease. This is shown in studies by calculating an odds ratio (OR) or another statistical measure.\nThe odds ratio (OR) is a measure used in case-control studies to show the association between a disease and a possible risk factor. The OR tells you the odds of having the disease if you have the risk factor, compared with the odds of having the disease if you do not have the risk factor.\nAn OR of 1 means that the risk factor is not associated with the disease. An OR greater than 1 means that the risk factor is associated with the disease. An OR less than 1 means that the risk factor is protective with respect to the disease.\nSOLUTION: The study found an association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer. But when the study subjects were divided into two groups, those who smoked and those who did not smoke, the association was not found in either group.\nThis shows that the smoking status is a confounding factor. A confounding factor is an unmeasured or poorly measured variable that is associated with both the disease and the risk factor. In this case, smoking status is a confounding factor because people who smoke are more likely to drink alcohol and also more likely to get lung cancer.\nThe scenario described is an example of confounding."}

A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the cells of an organism. A virus can only grow and replicate inside a host cell.\nWhen a virus enters a host cell, it can use the cell's machinery to replicate itself. The replicated viruses then leave the host cell and go on to infect other cells.\nViruses have a simple genetic material called nucleic acid. They can exist as a particle, or a virion. The nucleic acid, whether DNA or RNA, carries the genetic information that a virus needs to reproduce.\nMany viruses are spread by contact with an infected person or object. For example, a virus may spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus may land on a nearby surface, and then it can be released into the air when someone else comes into contact with the surface.\nSome viruses are spread by contact with an animal host. For example, a virus may spread after a person comes into contact with an infected animal's feces.\nMany viruses are spread by contact with contaminated food or water."}

Unfortunately, many women living with HIV give birth in countries where the health care systems are weak. This can make it difficult to prevent mother-to-child transmission.\nIn 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 290,000 new cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This was a significant decrease from the 530,000 cases estimated in 2005.\nThe risk of mother-to-child transmission is highest during the time of birth and breastfeeding. Some countries have made efforts to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. For example, these countries provide drugs to pregnant women to help prevent the transmission of HIV to their fetuses. They also provide drugs to breastfeeding women to help prevent the transmission of HIV to their infants.\nSOLUTION: The risk of HIV transmission from an infected mother to her fetus/infant was highest in Africa.\nIn 2013, the highest number of new cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV were in Africa. Many African countries have weak health care systems. This makes it difficult to prevent mother-to-child transmission."}

The replication of a virus begins when the virus enters a host cell.\nViruses do not have all the parts that cells have. Instead, viruses are made of a few proteins and a piece of genetic material. The genetic material contains information that the virus uses to replicate itself.\nViruses have different ways of replicating their genetic material. Some viruses, such as the influenza virus, have a negative strand RNA genetic material. Other viruses, such as the herpes virus, have a positive strand RNA genetic material.\nSome viruses, such as retroviruses, have RNA genetic material that acts like DNA. This means that the RNA acts as a template to produce a DNA copy of the genetic material. The DNA copy can then enter the host cell's nucleus and be replicated by the host cell.\nThe calcivirus family is a group of viruses that have a positive strand RNA genetic material.\nSOLUTION: The calcivirus family replicates as positive strand RNA viruses.\nA positive strand RNA virus has a positive sense RNA genetic material. This means that the genetic material acts as a template to produce a protein.\nWhen a positive strand RNA virus replicates, it uses its genetic material to produce two copies of the genetic material. These two copies are copies of the positive sense RNA.\nThe calcivirus family uses genetic reassortment to replicate. Genetic reassortment is a process by which two or more strands of genetic material swap pieces with each other. This process can produce offspring viruses that have a mixture of genetic material from their parents."}

A virus can cause many different diseases, including the common cold, influenza, and HIV.\nA virus's reproductive number tells you how many copies of the virus are produced by one infected person. If the reproductive number is greater than 1, the virus will spread.\nSOLUTION: The reproductive number tells you how many people will become infected from one case of a virus. If the reproductive number is greater than 1, the virus will spread.\nFor example, if a virus's reproductive number is 2, then 2 cases of the virus will appear from each initial case.\nIf a virus's reproductive number is less than 1, the virus will die out.\nFor example, if a virus's reproductive number is 0.5, then only 0.5 cases of the virus will appear from each initial case.\nThe incubation period is the time it takes for an infected person to start showing symptoms of a disease. This period can be different for each disease."}

If the number of values is even, the median is calculated by averaging the two middle values.\nMode is a measure of central tendency that is calculated by finding the value that occurs most frequently in a distribution.\nStandard deviation is a measure of dispersion that describes how spread out the values in a distribution are. A distribution with a high standard deviation has more spread out values than a distribution with a low standard deviation.\nSOLUTION: The median is the most likely to be the least biased estimator of central tendency for this distribution of biochemistry test scores. This is because the median is less affected by outliers than the mean.\nOutliers are values that are much higher or lower than the other values in a distribution. The mean is easily affected by outliers. For example, in the distribution of scores shown below, the mean is the average of the two highest and two lowest scores. These scores are outliers, and the mean is greatly affected by them.\nThe median is not affected by outliers. For example, in the distribution of scores shown below, the median is the score that is in the middle. This score is 67.\nMode is also affected by outliers. A score that is much higher or lower than the other scores will make the mode the highest or lowest score in the distribution.\nStandard deviation is a measure of dispersion that describes how spread out the values in a distribution are. A distribution with a high standard deviation has more spread out values than a distribution with a low standard deviation. This distribution of biochemistry test scores has a high standard deviation. So, the mode is a less appropriate measure of central tendency than the median."}

In a clinical trial, randomization is used to counterbalance possible differences among groups.\nRandomization is especially helpful for controlling for the following:\nEffect modification: Randomization helps to ensure that each group of subjects has an equal chance of including individuals who are more likely to benefit from the treatment. This is called effect modification.\nInteraction is the term used to describe the effect of one factor on the relationship between another factor and the outcome. For example, the relationship between a woman's level of education and her wages depends on her age. This age-education interaction shows how one factor may affect the relationship between another factor and the outcome.\nRecall bias: Randomization can also help to eliminate or reduce the effect of recall bias. Recall bias occurs when subjects in one group of a clinical trial remember more information about their illness than subjects in another group. This can lead to differences in how sick the groups seem to be.\nNon-compliance: Randomization can also help to eliminate or reduce the effect of non-compliance. Non-compliance occurs when some subjects in a clinical trial do not take their medicine as directed. This can lead to differences in how well the groups do.\nPlacebo effect: Randomization does not help to control for the placebo effect. The placebo effect occurs when subjects who take a pill with no medicine in it get better. Since the subjects do not know which pills contain medicine, they do not know who will get better. This makes it impossible to control for the placebo effect using randomization.\nSOLUTION: Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for effect modification."}

So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The genetic structure of rotavirus is ds RNA virus in segments. The virus has a double-stranded RNA genome made of multiple segments."}

{"question": "It is unlikely that a 'cure' of HIV is possible with current drugs because:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Even in combination current drugs do not completely block viral replication"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They do not penetrate to cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They cannot block viral transcription from integrated viral DNA"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They cannot penetrate to the CNS"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Drug development is a complex process that requires many years and a great deal of funding. While there are many drugs available to treat HIV, a 'cure' has not yet been developed. This is because HIV is a difficult virus to fight. It can hide inside cells and make copies of itself.\nThere are several reasons why a cure for HIV has not been developed:\nCurrent drugs do not completely block viral replication. Some drugs used to treat HIV inhibit the virus's replication. But the virus can also become resistant to these drugs. This means that the virus can continue to replicate even when it is being treated with drugs.\nThey do not penetrate to cells. HIV is a small virus. Its particles are only about 1/10,000th of a centimeter in size. Antibodies can help fight the virus, but they cannot penetrate cells. This makes it difficult for antibodies to stop the virus from entering and infecting cells.\nThey cannot block viral transcription from integrated viral DNA. HIV has a genetic material called DNA. The virus's genes contain the information that the virus needs to replicate. After the virus enters a cell, its genes are transcribed into RNA. The RNA carries the genetic information from the virus's genes. The RNA then uses the host cell's machinery to make new viral proteins and genes. Some of these proteins and genes are needed to make new virus particles. Antiretroviral drugs do not completely block viral transcription.\nThey cannot penetrate to the CNS. HIV can also infect cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Antiretroviral drugs do not easily reach these cells. This is one reason why people with HIV have a higher risk of HIV-related illnesses of the brain and nervous system."}

A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the cells of an organism. Virologists study the structure, behavior, and genetics of viruses.\nViruses have different types of genes. These genes contain the information that a virus needs to reproduce. Viral genes can be separated into three groups: core, nonstructural, and structural genes.\nCore genes are the few genes that are necessary for a virus to reproduce. All viruses have core genes.\nNonstructural genes help the virus reproduce. These genes may be further divided into essential and nonessential genes. Essential genes are needed for the virus to reproduce, while nonessential genes are not.\nStructural genes tell the virus how to build its parts. The structural genes specify the proteins that make up a virus. The proteins assemble to form the virus's outer coat, its inner genetic material, and any other parts of the virus.\nSOLUTION: To determine which viruses appear to be hypermutable, consider which viral genes are involved in mutation. Hypermutation is a change in a virus's genes that occurs during replication.\nA virus with a high rate of hypermutation has an increased number of nonstructural and structural mutations. These mutations can make the virus more resistant to drugs or change its ability to spread.\nThe diagram below shows which viral genes are involved in mutation.\nThe core genes do not have any genes that are involved in mutation. So, a virus cannot reproduce without its core genes.\nThe nonstructural genes have some genes that are involved in mutation. But a virus can reproduce with only its essential nonstructural genes.\nThe structural genes have genes that are involved in mutation. A virus needs all of its structural genes to reproduce. So, a virus cannot reproduce without its structural genes."}

For example, herpes viruses are spread by touching an infected person's skin."}
