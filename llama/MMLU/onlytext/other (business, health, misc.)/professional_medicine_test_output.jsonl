These nerves can be injured by direct trauma, such as from a hard hit or a cut. The injuries can cause pain, numbness, or a \"pins and needles\" feeling.\nSome common causes of nerve injury are:\nDirect trauma: A direct blow to the hand can cause a nerve to be injured. This can occur from a fall, a hit, or a cut.\nRepetitive motion: Certain movements can cause a nerve to be injured over time. This is because the movement damages or compresses the nerve.\nPressure: Pressure on a nerve can cause a nerve to be injured. This can occur from carrying heavy bags with the shoulder or placing the hand in a funny position for a long time.\nSOLUTION: The most likely cause of the numbness in the right hand is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist. This can occur from a hard hit, a cut, or from carrying heavy bags with the shoulder.\nThe median nerve at the wrist passes through a small space called the carpal tunnel. This space is formed by the bones in the wrist. The median nerve gives sensation to the palm and to the fingers except the pinky. It also moves the muscles in the thumb.\nIf the median nerve is squeezed in the carpal tunnel, the nerve cannot do its job. This can cause numbness, tingling, or pain in the hand. The symptoms may be worse at night."}

This occurs because insulin inhibits the use of fatty acids as fuel and promotes the use of glucose. Insulin also stimulates the synthesis of carbohydrates and fats.\nThe increased malonyl-CoA inhibits fatty acid oxidation. This is because malonyl-CoA is an intermediate in the synthesis of fatty acids. When malonyl-CoA concentrations are high, the synthesis of fatty acids is rerouted, and fatty acid oxidation is inhibited.\nThe increased malonyl-CoA does not directly inhibit glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, or fatty acid synthesis."}

The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "P-selectin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stromelysin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vascular endothelial growth factor"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Wound healing is a complex process that involves many cells, molecules, and signaling pathways. When a wound occurs, the body starts to repair the wound immediately. Cells in the wound area begin to divide and migrate to close the wound. Blood vessels in the area also start to grow, supplying the wound with oxygen and nutrients.\nThe four stages of wound healing are:\n1. Hematoma: The wound begins to fill with blood, which helps to clean the wound and starts the healing process.\n2. Inflammatory: White blood cells, called neutrophils, rush to the wound to fight infection. Inflammatory cells called macrophages also help to fight infection.\n3. Proliferative: As the wound heals, cells grow to close the wound. Blood vessels grow to provide nutrients for the healing cells.\n4. Maturation: The wound is fully healed when the skin is repaired and the scar tissue is strong. The scar tissue may not be as strong as the original tissue, but it is enough to prevent the wound from reopening.\nThe formation of granulation tissue (the soft, pink, and edematous tissue in the patient's wound) is part of the proliferative stage of wound healing. Increased activity of stromelysin is necessary for the formation of granulation tissue. Stromelysin is an enzyme that breaks down the extracellular matrix, a group of molecules that surround cells. When stromelysin activity increases, the extracellular matrix is broken down, and the wound begins to fill with blood vessels and inflammatory cells."}
{"question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22\u2013 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The patient has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder that affects muscle strength and development. DMD is caused by a lack of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact.\nDMD is caused by mutations, or changes, in the dystrophin gene. The dystrophin gene is passed down through families.\nA person with DMD has a mutation in one of his or her dystrophin genes. Some people are affected by the mutation in their gene, while others are carriers of the mutation.\nCarriers of the DMD gene have one normal gene and one mutated gene. Carriers do not have the classic symptoms of DMD, but they can pass the mutated gene to their children.\nA person with two mutated dystrophin genes has DMD. A person with two normal dystrophin genes does not have DMD. A person with one normal gene and one mutated gene is a carrier of DMD.\nSOLUTION: The patient's family history of DMD and her elevated serum muscle creatine kinase concentration suggest that she is a carrier of the disease. The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L, which is twice the normal concentration. This indicates that the mother is also a carrier of the disease.\nThe patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation. Approximately 50% of normal females and 90% of females with DMD have a pattern of inactivation of one X chromosome. This pattern of inactivation is established in each cell of a female's body before birth.\nRandom X inactivation is thought to occur in about 10% of normal females. Random inactivation does not follow a pattern. Some cells in these females will inactivate one X chromosome, while other cells will inactivate the other X chromosome."}

This can lead to problems such as incontinence, urinary tract infections, and kidney damage.\nThere are four main types of neurogenic bladders. Each type can be caused by a different problem.\nAutonomic neurogenic bladder. This type of bladder is caused by damage to the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that affects the body's involuntary functions. Damage to this system can cause problems with the bladder's ability to contract and empty.\nMotor paralytic bladder. This type of bladder is caused by damage to the nerves that control the bladder's muscles. As a result, the bladder can't contract or empty fully.\nReflex neurogenic bladder. This type of bladder is caused by a problem with the nerves that affect the bladder's muscles. In a reflex neurogenic bladder, the nerves may be too sensitive, causing spasms or other problems.\nUninhibited neurogenic bladder. This type of bladder is caused by damage to the nerves that inhibit, or slow down, the bladder's contractions. Without these inhibitory neurons, the bladder's contractions are too frequent and normal.\nSOLUTION: The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that the most likely diagnosis is autonomic neurogenic bladder. This type of bladder is caused by damage to the autonomic nervous system. The patient's history of a stroke and aphasia, or difficulty speaking, suggests that the patient may have had a stroke. Strokes can damage the autonomic nervous system and cause a neurogenic bladder."}

Each nephron has a glomerulus, a renal tubule, and a collecting duct.\nThe glomerulus is a blood-filtering device. It has a central filter, the glomerular filter, which allows small molecules, such as water and ions, to pass through and a loop, the Bowman's capsule, that surrounds the filter. The renal tubule is the pathway for the filtered molecules to enter the blood or be reabsorbed into the blood.\nThe pressure of the liquid in the glomerular filter is called the filtration coefficient, or Kf. The filtration coefficient is determined by the difference in hydrostatic pressure between the glomerulus and the filtration chamber. The hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by the liquid.\nWhen the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus increases, the filtration coefficient, or Kf, also increases. When the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus decreases, the filtration coefficient, or Kf, decreases.\nThe oncotic pressure is the pressure exerted by the water in the liquid. The oncotic pressure is due to the concentration of proteins in the water.\nThe oncotic pressure in the filtration chamber is called the effective oncotic pressure. The effective oncotic pressure is determined by the difference in protein concentration between the plasma and the filtrate.\nWhen the protein concentration in the plasma decreases, the effective oncotic pressure also decreases. When the protein concentration in the plasma increases, the effective oncotic pressure also increases.\nThe colloid osmotic pressure is the pressure exerted by larger molecules in the water. The colloid osmotic pressure is due to the concentration of proteins and other large molecules in the water.\nThe colloid osmotic pressure in the plasma is called the colloid osmotic pressure. The colloid osmotic pressure is determined by the difference in colloid osmotic pressure between the plasma and the filtrate.\nWhen the colloid osmotic pressure in the plasma decreases, the colloid osmotic pressure in the filtrate also decreases. When the colloid osmotic pressure in the plasma increases, the colloid osmotic pressure in the filtrate also increases.\nSOLUTION: A vascular clamp is a device that can be used to stop or slow the flow of blood through a blood vessel. When a clamp is placed on an efferent arteriole, the pressure of the blood in the arteriole increases. This increase in pressure causes the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus to increase.\nSince the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus increases, the filtration coefficient, or Kf, is likely to decrease."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSOLUTION: The patient's uncle has cognitive disabilities, and the patient is at the 90th percentile for head circumference. These traits are associated with a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DJ-1 gene. This type of mutation is called a trinucleotide repeat expansion.\nA trinucleotide repeat is a sequence of three nucleotides. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA. In a trinucleotide repeat, the three nucleotides can each be one of four types. These types are called adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine.\nSome trinucleotide repeats occur in genes. When a trinucleotide repeat occurs in a gene, the number of nucleotides in the repeat can be different from the normal number for that gene. When this difference is large, it is called a trinucleotide repeat expansion.\nTrinucleotide repeat expansions can cause diseases. The most common disease associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions is Huntington disease. Huntington disease is a disorder of the brain that causes movement, mood, and cognition problems.\nThe patient's expansions are in the DJ-1 gene. This gene has been associated with autism, a disorder that affects communication and behavior."}

The types of circulation shock are:\nCardiogenic. This type of shock is caused by a problem with the heart. The heart is not pumping blood properly, which causes blood pressure to drop and organ function to decrease.\nDistributive. This type of shock is caused by a problem with the blood vessels. The blood vessels become stiff and narrowed, which causes blood pressure to drop and organ function to decrease.\nHypovolemic. This type of shock is caused by a loss of blood or other fluid. The body has not enough volume, which causes blood pressure to drop and organ function to decrease.\nObstructive. This type of shock is caused by a blockage in the veins. The blockage prevents blood from flowing back to the heart, which causes blood pressure to drop and organ function to decrease.\nSOLUTION: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are most consistent with hypovolemic shock.

This process is called bone turnover. The process of bone breakdown releases molecules called cytokines into the blood. One cytokine, called RANKL, tells osteoclasts to break down bone.\nOsteoclasts are cells that break down bone. Osteoprotegerin is a molecule that acts on osteoclasts. It tells them to stop breaking down bone.\nThe balance of RANKL and osteoprotegerin in the blood tells you how much bone is being broken down. This balance is important because bone is broken down and replaced by new bone throughout life. If the balance is disturbed, bone may be broken down too quickly or too slowly.\nBisphosphonates are drugs that keep RANKL from telling osteoclasts to break down bone. This slows the breakdown of bone.\nDrugs that are called bisphosphonates are used to treat and prevent osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a condition in which bone is broken down too quickly. This can happen as part of the aging process. It can also happen if you have too little exposure to sunlight, if you are a postmenopausal woman, or if you have certain medical conditions."}

{"question": "A 38-year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of increasing lethargy for the past several hours. The patient is noncommunicative and you are unable to obtain an initial history of his present illness or a past medical history. You do not know if he takes any medications. Vital signs are temperature 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. On physical examination the patient is awake but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses clear lungs; cardiac examination discloses a systolic click. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone. Serum electrolyte concentrations are normal. Complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm3 with 23% band neutrophils. The patient's caregiver, who is also the patient's guardian, cannot be located and staff at the group home where the patient resides cannot be reached by telephone.

In an emergency, it may be difficult to obtain the patient's medical history. In this case, it is important to try to find out what medications the patient takes. Medications that the patient takes may be listed on the patient's medical identification bracelet. If the patient does not have a bracelet, the caregiver may know which medications the patient takes.\nSOLUTION: The patient's vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory results do not suggest a serious infection. The patient is not in pain, and there is no evidence of a neurological insult. The patient's decreased muscle tone and normal electrolyte levels suggest that the patient's lethargy may be caused by a metabolic problem. The patient's normal serum electrolyte concentrations and normal urinalysis results rule out an electrolyte imbalance. The systolic click heard on cardiac examination is a common finding in patients with Down syndrome and is not cause for concern. The patient's guardian cannot be located, and the patient's caregiver at the group home is not available. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to obtain an echocardiogram to evaluate the patient's heart function."}
