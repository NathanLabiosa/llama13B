These procedures should include reviewing the subsequent events log and obtaining written assessments from management, if applicable.\nSubsequent events are events that occur between the date of the balance sheet and the issuance of the auditor's report. An entity's accounting treatment for subsequent events is determined by the nature of the event and the amount of time between the event and the issuance of the auditor's report.\nAn auditor should consider the following in evaluating management's assessments of subsequent events:\n- The timing of the subsequent events in relation to the issuance of the auditor's report.\n- The nature of the subsequent events.\n- The assessment of the entity's management.\n- The possible effects of the subsequent events on the financial statements.\nSubsequent events are significant and require adjustment to the financial statements if they occur before the issuance of the auditor's report and:\n- The financial statements are misleading.\n- The subsequent event would have been material to the reader of the financial statements.\n- The entity's management did not identify the subsequent event in response to an inquiry from the auditor.\nAfter identifying the subsequent events, the auditor should determine whether the financial statements are misleading in need of an adjustment. This determination is made in the context of the financial statements taken as a whole.\nThe auditor should also obtain written assessments from management regarding subsequent events that were not reported in the financial statements. The auditor should include these assessments in the audit file.\nSOLUTION: The auditor should compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.

This is because the money you get five years from now is worth less than money you get today.\nThe amount of money that $500 is worth less than today is called the discount rate. The discount rate tells you the cost of waiting to get money.\nIf the discount rate is 10%, then $500 in five years is worth $300 today. So, the profit for year five is $200.\nThe profit for year ten is $500.\nThe total profits are $200 + $500 = $700.\nThe cost of the investment is $500.\nThe NPV is $700 - $500 = $200."}

The carry amount equals the bond's issue price plus accretion.\nThe bond's issue price is the amount of the bond that the company originally issued. The bond's issue price is a premium if the bond was issued for more than its face value. The bond's issue price is a discount if the bond was issued for less than its face value.\nThe accretion is the amount by which the bond's carry amount is increased each period. The amount of accretion is equal to the premium (if any) divided by the number of periods in one period.\nFor example, if a bond is issued at a premium of $1,000 and has no accretion, the carry amount of the bond is $1,000.\nIf the bond has accretion of $100, the carry amount of the bond is increased by $100. The bond's carry amount is now $1,100.\nThe effective interest method of amortization uses the bond's carry amount instead of the bond's face amount when calculating interest expense. This means that the effective interest method takes the bond's premium or discount into account when it calculates the bond's interest expense.\nThe straight-line method of amortization uses the bond's face amount instead of the bond's carry amount when calculating interest expense. This means that the straight-line method does not take the bond's premium or discount into account when it calculates the bond's interest expense.\nIf a bond is issued at a premium, the straight-line method will overestimate the bond's interest expense in the early years and underestimate the bond's interest expense in the later years.\nIf a bond is issued at a discount, the straight-line method will underestimate the bond's interest expense in the early years and overestimate the bond's interest expense in the later years.\nSOLUTION: The error caused the bond's carrying amount to be overstated. The error also caused the bond's amortized cost to be overstated. The error did not affect the bond's earnings."}

Depreciation is a method of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. The useful life is the period over which an asset is expected to be used by a company.\nDepreciation expense is included in the company's income statement. It is an increase to the asset's book value, which is its value on the company's balance sheet. The book value of an asset is determined by adding its original cost to the sum of its accumulated depreciation.\nA company may sell an asset in which it has invested. If the asset is sold for more than its book value, the company will record a gain on sale. If the asset is sold for less than its book value, the company will record a loss on sale.\nSOLUTION: A company that expects to sell an asset in less than one year should classify the asset as a current asset. The old building will be reclassified as a current asset.\nThe old building will no longer be depreciated. A company stops depreciating an asset when it is sold or replaced.\nThe old building will be valued at historical cost.

The gain or loss is determined by subtracting the partnership's adjusted basis in the property from the amount it was sold for. The adjusted basis is determined by adding any original basis in the property to any costs the partnership incurred to improve the property.\nThe partnership's basis in the property is determined the same way for tax purposes as it is for accounting purposes. The partnership's basis is its investment in the property. The partnership's basis is increased by the effects of inflation.\nIf the partnership has more basis in the property than one person's share of the partnership, the partnership's basis is equal to that person's share of the partnership.\nSOLUTION: The AQR partnership agreement specifies that each partner will share equally in the partnership\u2019s profits and losses. This means that each partner's share of the partnership's basis in the land is equal to each partner's share of the partnership. Each partner's share of the partnership is one-third.\nTherefore, each partner's adjusted basis for the land is one-third of the partnership's total adjusted basis in the land. The partnership's total adjusted basis in the land is $80,000, which is the partnership's cost basis of $60,000 plus the $20,000 that AQR contributed to the partnership.\nSo, each partner's share of the gain from the sale is $100,000 x 1/3 = $33,333.\nEach partner reports a capital gain of $33,333."}

An auditor's main concern is identifying any material misstatements that might occur. A misstatement is considered material if it is large enough to affect an investor's decision about whether to buy, hold, or sell the entity's securities.\nAn auditor uses various techniques to assess the risk that a material misstatement may exist. These techniques may include reviewing the entity's internal controls, obtaining an understanding of the entity and its industry, and observing the financial statement audit procedures of the previous year.\nOnce an auditor has assessed the risk of material misstatement, the auditor decides how to conduct the audit. The auditor may increase audit procedures for high-risk areas and decrease them for low-risk areas.\nIf an auditor identifies a material misstatement while conducting the audit, the auditor will need to determine whether the material misstatement was caused by error or fraud.\nAn error is an unintentional misstatement. Errors can be caused by mistakes or oversights.\nFraud is a intentional misstatement. Fraud can be caused by deceit or dishonesty.\nAn auditor's main concern is identifying fraud because fraud can be a major threat to the financial statements' integrity.\nSOLUTION: The circumstances most likely to cause an auditor to suspect that there are material misstatements in an entity's financial statements are:\nThere are unusual discrepancies between the entity's records and confirmation replies.\nUnusual discrepancies may indicate that there are errors or fraud in the financial statements.\nManagement enforces strict budgetary controls over the entity's departmental supervisors.\nStrict budgetary controls may cause errors or fraud in the financial statements. For instance, departmental supervisors may use shortcuts in recording financial transactions to avoid exceeding their budgets.\nThe monthly bank reconciliation ordinarily includes several large outstanding checks.\nOutstanding checks may be evidence of fraud."}

A company or government issues a bond to raise money. An investor who buys the bond is lending money to the issuer. The issuer agrees to pay interest to the investor and to repay the principal amount of the bond at the end of the bond's life.\nBond prices rise when interest rates fall, and bond prices fall when interest rates rise. This is because bond prices are equal to the present value of the bond's coupon payments and principal payment. When interest rates fall, the present value of the bond's payments increases, and the bond price rises. When interest rates rise, the present value of the bond's payments decreases, and the bond price falls.\nSOLUTION: The bond has an interest payment date of April 1. The bond is issued on June 1. So, the bond is less than a year old on April 1.\nBecause the bond is less than a year old on April 1, it has not paid interest for a full year.

The suppliers must be able to deliver products and materials on time, in the exact quantities needed, and in the correct sequence.\nJIT can be more efficient than traditional inventory systems. With a JIT system, inventory costs are lower, and productivity is higher. There is less waste from overproduction, and there is less time and money spent on inventory management.\nSOLUTION: The JIT approach uses a push-through system while traditional approaches use a pull-through system.\nIn a push-through system, production starts whenever there is an order to fill. This means that the production process is not delayed by waiting for materials or customer orders.\nIn a pull-through system, production starts whenever materials or customer orders are available. This means that the production process is delayed by the time it takes to have materials or orders brought to the factory."}

These costs include the costs of laboratory equipment, materials, and personnel who perform research and development activities.\nThe accounting for research and development costs depends on the purpose of the costs and the expected future benefits.\nIf the costs are associated with the development of a new product or improvement of an existing product, the costs should be capitalized.\nIf the costs are associated with general research, the costs should be expensed.\nCapitalized costs:\nCosts are capitalized as a component of research or development assets when they are incurred during the development of a new product or improvement of an existing product. The capitalized costs are then charged to expense when the product is sold.\nFor example, a company capitalized the costs of developing a new product. When the product was sold, the company charged the capitalized costs to expense.\nExpensed costs:\nCosts are expensed when they are incurred during general research. General research is research that is not focused on the development of a specific product or improvement of an existing product.\nFor example, a company expensed the costs of researching new methods of manufacturing an existing product.\nAccounting for research and development costs with no alternative future use:\nThe costs of research and development that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred."}

Transfer pricing is the process of setting prices for products and services that are transferred between two parts of a company that are in different countries.\nWhen a company has operations in multiple countries, it can use transfer pricing to allocate the company's global profit among the different countries. This type of pricing can help a company reduce its tax burden.\nFor example, if a company in the United States sells a product to a subsidiary in another country, the price of the product is a transfer price. The subsidiary in the other country pays the price, and the subsidiary's profit is subject to the tax laws of that country.\nThe price at which the subsidiary purchases the product from the U.S. parent is also a transfer price. The parent company in the United States pays the price, and the parent's profit is subject to the tax laws of the United States.\nThe key to successful transfer pricing is to set prices for products and services transferred between the different parts of a company in a way that takes advantage of the differences in tax laws among countries.\nSOLUTION: Predatory pricing is the pricing policy that results in a price to external customers that is lower than the competitive price for a given industry.\nA monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve. The monopolist will set its price equal to the competitive price when it is earning maximum profit.\nIf the monopolist sets its price below the competitive price, it will lose money on every sale. But it can use the strategic sale to put competitors out of business.\nA monopolist cannot use predatory pricing if competitors can easily enter the market."}

Derivatives can be used to hedge risk, speculate on the future price of the underlying asset, or to arbitrage.\nDerivatives can be divided into two broad categories: exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC).\nAn exchange-traded derivative is a contract that is traded on a public exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Exchange-traded derivatives have standardized terms and are bought and sold through a broker.\nAn over-the-counter (OTC) derivative is a contract that is customized for an individual or small group of investors. OTC derivatives are negotiated directly with a broker or dealer, and their terms are specific to the needs of the investors.\nA money market fund is a type of mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities, such as Treasury bills and commercial paper. A money market fund is considered a low-risk investment because the securities in the fund are short-term and are rated high for safety.\nA bank certificate of deposit is a savings instrument that guarantees a specific interest rate for a fixed period of time. When you buy a certificate of deposit, you are lending money to the bank for a set period of time. In return, the bank promises to pay you a specific interest rate.\nAn option contract is a derivative that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a specific date.\nA municipal bond is a debt security that is issued by a state or local government. An investor who buys a municipal bond lends money to the state or local government in exchange for a promise to pay back the loan with interest."}

An accountant can use this understanding to identify potential material misstatements in the financial statements.\nInternal control is the process a company uses to protect its assets, produce accurate financial statements, and operate effectively and efficiently. An accountant reviewing financial statements should observe whether the company's internal control procedures are working as intended.\nWhen conducting a review engagement, an accountant is not required to perform tests of the internal control over financial reporting. Instead, the accountant may identify key controls and determine whether the company has documented its controls. If the company has not documented its controls, the accountant may need to discuss the documentation with the company.\nSOLUTION: An accountant is most likely to review the relationships of financial statement elements expected to conform to predictable patterns. These patterns are called financial statement ratios.\nFinancial statement ratios are used to compare the financial statements of a company to other companies or to industry standards.

The legal life of a copyright is measured in terms of the life of the author plus a set number of years. For example, the legal life of a copyright owned by an author is the life of the author plus 50 years.\nSOLUTION: A copyright is an intangible asset that is initially recorded at its purchase price. The copyright will be amortized, or allocated, to the income statement as an expense over its legal life.\nThe amortization expense is calculated as the copyright's purchase price, minus its salvage value, divided by its legal life. The salvage value is the amount that the copyright will be worth at the end of its legal life.\nFor a copyright, the salvage value is usually zero, so the amortization expense is equal to the copyright's purchase price divided by its legal life.\nThe following steps can be used to determine the amortization expense:\n1. Determine the expected economic life of the copyright. The expected economic life is the number of years that the copyright is expected to generate revenue for the company. In this case, the expected economic life is five years.\n2.

Instead, an audit aims to increase the cost of committing a material misstatement, so that any misstatements that do occur are small.\nThe following factors can heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of fraudulent financial reporting:"}

One way to measure quality is to track internal failure costs. Internal failure costs are the costs incurred when a product or service is not of acceptable quality. As the quality of products or services improves, the internal failure costs should decrease.\nThe techniques described below are effective ways to measure improvements in product quality as a result of internal failure costs:\nInspection of in-process goods: This technique involves reviewing products at various stages of production to identify quality problems. By examining products before they become finished goods, you can identify and correct problems earlier, which can reduce internal failure costs.\nTracking the number of products reworked: Reworking involves correcting a product that has not met quality standards. Tracking the number of products reworked can indicate whether improvements to product quality have been effective. If the number of products reworked decreases, that may be a sign that internal failure costs are declining.\nTracking warranty expenses over time: Warranty expenses are costs incurred to repair products that have failed. Tracking warranty expenses over time can indicate whether product quality has improved. If warranty expenses decrease, that may be a sign that internal failure costs are down.\nRecording the number of products returned over time: Recording the number of products returned by customers can indicate whether product quality has improved. If the number of products returned decreases, that may be a sign that internal failure costs are declining."}
{"question": "A CPA prepares a client\u2019s tax return containing business travel expenses without inquiring about the existence of documentation for the expenses.

If a preparer is negligent in preparing a tax return, the return may be deemed to be fraudulent.\nNegligence occurs when a preparer does not exercise the level of care that a reasonable preparer would exercise in similar circumstances.\nIf a preparer is negligent in preparing a return, the return may be deemed fraudulent. If a fraudulent return is filed, the preparer may be charged with a crime.\nIn addition, a taxpayer who files a fraudulent return is subject to an understatement penalty, as well as other penalties, if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines that the taxpayer has an understatement on the return. An understatement occurs when an item on the return is reported inaccurately.\nAn understatement can occur even if the return is not fraudulent. For example, an understatement can occur if the preparer does not claim a deduction that the taxpayer is entitled to claim.\nIf a tax return preparer is liable for a penalty, the preparer may be assessed the penalty. If the preparer is a tax professional, the preparer's penalty may be reported to the tax professional's licensing board.\nSOLUTION: The CPA may be assessed a tax return preparer penalty.\nThe CPA did not inquire about the existence of documentation for the expenses. This is a lack of due diligence."}

The parent company's consolidated financial statements must include the subsidiaries' assets, liabilities, and results of operations.\nThe parent company's consolidated financial statements should reflect the elimination of the subsidiaries' investments in other subsidiaries. This is done by adjusting the subsidiaries' financial statements so that the subsidiaries are not shown to be investing in other subsidiaries.\nFor example, if Subsidiary A owns 60% of Subsidiary B's outstanding common stock, the financial statements of Subsidiary A should reflect the elimination of Subsidiary B's investment in Subsidiary A. This adjustment is made by reducing Subsidiary B's assets and increasing Subsidiary A's liabilities by the amount of Subsidiary B's investment in Subsidiary A.\nThe consolidated financial statements should also reflect the subsidiaries' investment in their parent company. This investment is shown as a liability on the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.\nFor example, if Subsidiary A owns 40% of the parent company's outstanding common stock, the parent company's financial statements should include a $40 million liability to Subsidiary A. This liability is included in the parent company's total liabilities.\nSOLUTION: To determine the amount of total liabilities that should be reported in the consolidated financial statements, you need to combine the total liabilities of King and Simmon.\nThe consolidated total liabilities should also include the $100,000 note payable from Simmon to King. This note payable is included in Simmon's liabilities, but it is also a liability of King. So, the consolidated total liabilities should include the $100,000 note payable twice: once in Simmon's liabilities and once in King's liabilities."}

For example, you can record the cash you expect to receive in the future, but have not yet received, as an accrued receivable. You can also record the cash you expect to pay in the future, but have not yet paid, as an accrued expense.\nDeferrals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments.

With this method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods.\nThe FIFO method stands for first-in, first-out. With this method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods.\nWhether the LIFO method or the FIFO method is used, the same goods are always treated as being sold first. But the opposite methods ensure that the taxpayer will match income to the oldest costs when using the FIFO method and to the newest costs when using the LIFO method.\nSOLUTION: A corporate taxpayer can use the LIFO method for tax purposes even if the FIFO method is used for financial statement purposes. This is because the IRS allows taxpayers to use different methods to figure taxable income than they use to figure financial income.\nThe LIFO method can result in a lower cost of sales and higher taxable income when prices are rising. This is because the older, lower-cost inventory is added to the cost of sales when using the LIFO method. This higher cost of sales means that the taxable income is higher than it would be if the FIFO method were used.\nThe taxpayer is not required to receive permission each year from the Internal Revenue Service to continue using the LIFO method. The LIFO method is allowed indefinitely, unless the taxpayer chooses to switch to the FIFO method."}

The cost of equity may include the risk-free rate of return, the expected inflation rate, and a risk premium. The risk premium is the extra return that investors demand for investing in a stock rather than a risk-free asset, such as a U.S. Treasury security.\nThe following factors can affect the risk premium for a particular stock:\n1. Market risk: Investors may require a higher risk premium for a stock that is more volatile or risky.\n2. Company-specific risk: Investors may require a higher risk premium for a stock that is more likely to fail or underperform.\nSOLUTION: The expected dividend growth rate is 3% and the inflation rate is expected to fall from 5% per year to 3% per year. So, the real dividend will grow by the inflation rate. As a result, the cost of equity will likely remain stable."}

Investments in debt securities are accounted for by preparing an amortized cost basis. The amortized cost basis includes the purchase price of the security and the accumulated amortization of the security. The accumulated amortization is the amount by which the security's market value has been lowered to its amortized cost basis.\nThe market value of a debt security is based on the security's market price. The market price of a debt security is the price that the security would sell for in the market. The market price can be based on the security's interest rate, credit quality, and other factors.\nA company may also hold investments in equity securities, which are financial instruments that represent an ownership interest in a corporation or a government. Investments in equity securities are accounted for by preparing a cost basis. The cost basis is the amount that the security was purchased for.\nA company may recognize a gain or a loss on an investment in a debt or equity security. A gain occurs when the security's market value is higher than its amortized cost basis or cost basis. A loss occurs when the security's market value is lower than its amortized cost basis or cost basis.\nSOLUTION: To recognize a debt or equity security, determine the security's market value and its amortized cost basis. Then, compare the market value and the amortized cost basis.\nThe security's market value was $30,000, and the security's amortized cost basis was $24,000. The security's market value was higher than its amortized cost basis. So, the security had a gain.\nTo calculate the gain, subtract the amortized cost basis from the market value.\n$30,000 market value - $24,000 amortized cost basis = $6,000 gain."}

Two useful metrics for making this decision are net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR).\nThe NPV tells you how much the investment is worth today. If the NPV is positive, it means that the investment is worth more than the cost. If the NPV is negative, it means that the investment is worth less than the cost.\nThe IRR is the interest rate at which the investment begins to break even. The IRR tells you when an investment will make you whole, or will start to make you whole. If the IRR is greater than the cost of the investment, then the investment is worth more than the cost.\nYou can use the following rules to compare investment projects based on their NPV and IRR:\n1. If one project has a higher NPV than another project, then the first project is the better investment.\n2. If one project has a higher IRR than another project, then the first project is the better investment.\n3. If the IRR is the same for both projects, then the project with the higher NPV is the better investment.\nSOLUTION: Look at the IRR.\nThe IRR will never rank a project with an IRR less than the required rate as acceptable. So, if the required rate of return is greater than the IRR of a project, then that project is not the best investment.\nThe IRR will always rank a project with an IRR greater than the required rate as acceptable. So, if the required rate of return is greater than the IRR of a project, then that project is not the best investment.\nIf the IRR is equal to the required rate of return, then the project with the higher NPV is the better investment."}

The following steps will help you determine the proper accounting method:\n1. Identify the type of cost.\nSome costs are directly attributable to the acquisition of a business, and they are accounted for separately from the costs of the business. These costs are called acquisition costs.\nOther costs are directly attributable to the operation of the business, and they are accounted for within the business.\n2. Determine the nature of the acquisition.\nThe accounting method for the acquisition costs depends on the nature of the acquisition.\nIf the acquisition does not meet the criteria to be accounted for as a business combination, the costs are expensed.\nIf the acquisition is an asset purchase, the acquisition costs are capitalized as part of the cost of the assets acquired. The acquisition costs are not expensed.\nIf the acquisition is a stock purchase, the acquisition costs are capitalized as part of the cost of the net assets acquired. The acquisition costs are not expensed.\n3. Capitalize the costs as part of goodwill.\nIf the acquisition costs are capitalized, they are initially recorded as part of goodwill. Goodwill is an asset that represents the excess of the cost of the net assets acquired over the fair market value of the net assets.\nThe initial recording of goodwill is followed by an annual impairment test. The impairment test compares the current fair market value of the business to its carrying value (the total of the net assets plus goodwill). If the carrying value exceeds the current fair market value, goodwill is impaired. The impairment is subtracted from goodwill to decrease its value.\n4. Allocate the costs to the nonmonetary assets acquired.\nIf the acquisition costs can be directly assigned to the value of specific nonmonetary assets, the costs are allocated to the value of those assets. The allocated costs are part of the cost of the assets and are not added to goodwill.\n5. Capitalize the costs as an other asset.\nIf the acquisition costs cannot be directly assigned to the value of specific nonmonetary assets, the costs are capitalized as an other asset. The other asset is amortized over a period of up to 10 years."}

One of the key responsibilities of auditors is to identify situations that may increase the risk of material misstatements due to fraud. Material misstatements are those that could affect decisions made by users of the financial statements.\nThere are many ways that the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting can be heightened. Some of the more common situations that may increase this risk include:\nA significant disregard for regulatory authorities.\nA lack of turnover of employees in the accounting department.\nAn absence of direct observation of the inventory count.\nA significant increase in sales to related parties.\nA significant increase in the use of complex transactions.\nAn auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting is often heightened when there is a lack of turnover of employees in the accounting department. This is because it is easier to perpetuate a fraud when there is a lack of turnover in the employees who are responsible for the accounting records."}

Such spending is called a capital expenditure if it is for an asset, and an operating expense if it is for goods or services that are used up or consumed.\nA company can also borrow money or receive investment. This is called a financing activity.\nA company can also sell assets it owns or receive investment from other companies. This is called an investing activity.\nWhen a company prepares its financial statements, it must decide when to record the transactions that took place during the year. The company uses an accounting calendar that is different from the calendar-year end.\nThe accounting calendar has a specific beginning and end.

The company expensed the $90,000 cash payment in October, year 1, to its services expense general ledger account. But the services were not performed until November, year 1.\nSo, the $90,000 cash payment was made in October, but the services were received in November.

Estimates may change as new information becomes available. When an accounting estimate is changed, the change can be made either prospectively or retrospectively.\nProspective change: The effect of a prospective change in an accounting estimate is included in the current period.\nFor example, if an entity decides to increase its estimate of the useful life of a plant asset, the increase is made for all future periods. The effect is included in the current period by increasing the estimate of the plant asset's value.\nRetrospective change: The effect of a retrospective change in an accounting estimate is included in all prior periods.\nFor example, if an entity discovers that it has been using an inappropriate accounting estimate for an asset, the estimate is changed for all prior periods. The effect is included in all prior periods by showing the asset's value and costs of goods sold for all prior periods on a retroactive basis.\nIn general, a change in an accounting principle is a change in the accounting rules that govern the assignment of costs or the allocation of resources. Principles are different from estimates in that principles always apply.\nA change in an accounting principle is made on a prospective basis. The effect of a prospective change in an accounting principle is included in the current period.\nFor example, if an entity changes from the accrual to the cash basis of accounting, the effect of the change is included in the current period. Revenues are recognized when cash is received, and expenses are recognized when cash is paid.\nA change in an accounting principle is made on a retroactive basis. The effect of a retroactive change in an accounting principle is included in all prior periods.\nFor example, if an entity changes from the FIFO to the LIFO inventory valuation method, the effect of the change is included in all prior periods. Income is increased and expenses are decreased for all prior periods.\nIf an entity is unsure whether a change is a change in an accounting estimate or a change in an accounting principle, the change is made using the following guidelines:\nIf the change is a result of changing circumstances or the entity's behavior, the change is an accounting estimate. For example, if an entity decides to use a different depreciation method for a plant asset, the change is an accounting estimate.\nIf the change is a result of a change in an accounting principle, the change is a change in accounting principle. For example, if a government requirement changes, the change is a change in accounting principle.\nIt is easier to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a correction of an error than it is to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a change in accounting principle.\nA correction of an error is a change that accounts for an error that was overlooked in a prior period. The effect of a correction of an error is included in the period in which the error is discovered.\nFor example, if an entity discovers that it reported an incorrect amount for the salary expense of its employees, the expense is increased by the amount of the error for the period in which the error is discovered."}

Intraperiod income tax allocation does not affect the overall income tax expense for the year.\nA company may need to allocate income tax expense to different periods within the same year. This may happen if the company has an NPB (net tax effect of unusual items) or if the company needs to allocate tax expense to different periods for the purpose of determining its current tax liability.\nThe tax effect of unusual items is the difference between the tax expense with the unusual items included and the tax expense with the unusual items excluded. The tax effect is called an NPB (net tax effect of unusual items).\nIf a company has an NPB for the year, the company must allocate the NPB to each period within the year. The company must determine the amount of the NPB that relates to each period.\nExtraordinary gains and losses are gains and losses that are unusual or infrequent. Intraperiod income tax allocation does not apply to extraordinary gains and losses.\nDiscontinued operations are operations that have been discontinued. Intraperiod income tax allocation does not apply to income from discontinued operations.\nOperating income is income from the company's ongoing operations. Income from continuing operations is operating income. Intraperiod income tax allocation does not apply to extraordinary gains and losses or to income from discontinued operations. It applies to income from continuing operations."}

Standard cost is the expected cost of making or buying a product.\nWhen actual cost is higher than standard cost, there is a favorable variance. This means that the product was sold for more than expected. The company can use the extra money to improve its profit.\nWhen actual cost is lower than standard cost, there is an unfavorable variance. This means that the product was sold for less than expected. The company may need to raise prices or cut costs to improve its profit.\nSOLUTION: Allocating the variances to work in process and finished goods means that the costs of those products are increased. This reflects the fact that the products were more or less expensive to make than expected.\nAllocating the variances to cost of goods sold means that the costs of those products are reduced. This reflects the fact that the company sold the products for more than they cost to make.\nBecause both variances were unfavorable, writing them off directly to cost of goods sold had the effect of increasing cost of goods sold and decreasing net income.\nAllocating the variances to work in process and finished goods would have had the opposite effects: it would have decreased cost of goods sold and increased net income."}
