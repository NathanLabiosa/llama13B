This is how the translocation happens: one of the chromosomes breaks off at a point near the centromere. The broken piece and the intact piece then trade places. The chromosome will have two centromeres after the translocation.\nThese two centromeres will form a ring around the chromosome. This ring can cause problems. When cells divide, the ring of centromeres can pull the chromosome apart. As a result, cells may end up with too many or too few chromosomes.\nSOLUTION: In a Robertsonian translocation, fusion occurs at the centromeres.

The mRNA molecule contains the information from the DNA molecule that is needed to build a protein.\nZinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are involved in the control of transcription.\nZinc finger proteins have the ability to bind to specific regions of DNA. They can do this because they have the right shape and chemical properties to recognize and bind DNA.\nHelix-turn-helix proteins have a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain. The HTH domain has the ability to bind to DNA. When a helix-turn-helix protein binds to a stretch of DNA, it can either activate or inhibit the expression of the genes in that stretch of DNA."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter.

Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is autosomal dominant. This means that the gene for the trait is located on an autosome (a non-sex chromosome) and that a dominant allele causes the organism's version of the trait to appear.\nAn organism with at least one dominant allele for the malignant hyperthermia gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. A pea plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait.

It is necessary for a female to have two X chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. Because females have two X chromosomes, one X chromosome must be turned off during embryonic development so that both X chromosomes are not active in the same cells. This process is called X-chromosome inactivation.\nIn each cell of a female, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated during embryonic development. For most cells, the inactivation choice is random, but some cells have a preference for inactivating the X chromosome inherited from the mother or the father. As a result of X-chromosome inactivation, some cells have a paternal X chromosome and some cells have a maternal X chromosome.\nThis process helps to ensure that a female has a normal balance of X-chromosome genes. For example, if both X chromosomes are active in a cell, one of the X chromosomes' genes will be turned off. This is called X-chromosome gene silencing. If a cell turns off the X chromosome inherited from the mother, the daughter will have a maternal X chromosome. If a cell turns off the X chromosome inherited from the father, the daughter will have a paternal X chromosome.\nSOLUTION: X-chromosome inactivation occurs in humans. This process is necessary for a female to have a normal balance of X-chromosome genes. X-chromosome inactivation is not the cause of the Y chromosome being genetically inactive. The Y chromosome contains fewer genes than the X chromosome. Some of the genes on the Y chromosome are involved in male sex determination.\nFruit flies have a different sex determination system. Males are not affected by X-chromosome inactivation."}

An organism's genes, which are passed from parents to offspring, contain the instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

These disorders are called inherited disorders.\nInherited disorders can be caused by genes, which are pieces of hereditary material that are passed down through families. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: If both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder, then each parent has at least one recessive allele for the gene that causes the disorder. Each parent will pass one allele to each child.\nAn organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait.\nSo, each child of affected parents will have a mix of alleles, with at least one dominant allele.

For example, the genotype frequency for an allele is equal to 1 if all organisms have that allele and equal to 0 if all organisms do not have that allele.\nThe genotype frequency for each genotype at a gene is the sum of the products of the genotype frequency for each allele at the gene. For example, the genotype frequency for organisms with two alleles at a gene is equal to the product of the genotype frequency for each allele at the gene.\nThe expected frequency for each allele at a gene is calculated from the genotype frequencies and the number of alleles in the population. The expected frequency for an allele is calculated as the sum of the product of the genotype frequency for the allele and the number of alleles in the population.\nSOLUTION: To determine the genotype frequency of heterozygotes, calculate the expected frequency for the heterozygous genotype.\nThe expected frequency for the heterozygous genotype is the sum of the product of the genotype frequency for each allele and the number of alleles in the population.\nFor this gene, the genotype frequency for the heterozygous genotype is 0.6 \u00d7 0.4 = 0.24.\nSo, the genotype frequency of heterozygotes is 0.24."}

Because females have two copies of the X chromosome, they have a backup copy of the gene if one copy is affected. This means that females can be carriers of X-linked genes but can still have normal health.\nMales have one X chromosome, inherited from their mother. If the only copy of a gene on the X chromosome is affected, males will have the inherited version of the gene. This can cause disease.\nSOLUTION: X-linked dominant inheritance is a type of X-linked inheritance in which a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome can cause the disease. The mutation can cause a different version of the gene to be active than the usual version.\nIf a male has at least one normal copy of the gene, he will be unaffected by the disease. In this case, the disease is not passed down to male offspring.\nIf a female has only one normal copy of the gene, she will be unaffected by the disease. In this case, the disease is not passed down to female offspring.\nIf a female has two copies of the gene, one normal and one with the mutation, the normal copy of the gene will be used.

So, the number of fragments into which the bacteriophage genome is cut depends on the recognition site for the enzyme within the genome.\nIf the recognition site is cut more times than any other site, that site is the most common site. The bacteriophage genome is cut into the most number of fragments at this site.\nIf two or more recognition sites are cut the same number of times, the shorter of those sites is the next most common site.

The operon is controlled by a regulatory protein called the lac repressor.\nThe lac repressor can bind to the operator region of the lac operon. When the repressor is bound to the operator, it keeps the genes of the lac operon from being transcribed.\nLactose is converted to allolactose.

Many microsatellites have the simple repeats shown above. For example, the first microsatellite in the Drosophila melanogaster species has a repeat of the sequence TA.\nMicrosatellite instability is the result of mistakes that occur during DNA replication. In microsatellite instability, the length of the microsatellite repeats is altered. For example, the repeat in the Drosophila microsatellite might become TA instead of the normal TAG.\nMicrosatellite instability can be caused by tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes are involved in controlling cell growth. When a cell has a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, the cell may grow and divide without control. This can lead to the development of a tumor.\nInherited (familial) types of cancer can be caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes. For example, familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene APC. This genetic mutation leads to the development of polyps in the colon. Polyps are abnormal growths that can turn into cancer.\nSome types of cancer are caused by microsatellite instability. These cancers are called microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers. MSI-H cancers are often found in people who have a tumor suppressor gene mutation.\nSOLUTION: Marked microsatellite instability is a feature of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). HNPCC is also called Lynch syndrome.\nIn HNPCC, microsatellite instability is caused by mutations in the BRAF, MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 genes. These genes are involved in maintaining the correct sequence of DNA. When these genes are mutated, microsatellite instability can occur."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Achondroplasia is a trait in humans. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele A is for normal trait value, and the allele a is for reduced trait value.\nMutations that cause achondroplasia are changes to the A allele. These mutations make the allele a. The allele a is for the reduced trait value.\nSo, mutations that cause achondroplasia exert an effect which can be classified as gain-of-function. A gain-of-function mutation increases the effect of an allele. The A allele, with the mutation, has a greater effect than the normal A allele. As a result, the organism's phenotype is the reduced trait value."}

Consanguinity can indicate whether an organism's genotype for a gene is the same for two people.\nBecause consanguinity shows how closely related two people are, consanguinity is a good predictor of an organism's inheritance pattern. An organism's inheritance pattern can be autosomal, X-linked, or Y-linked.\nAn organism's inheritance pattern can affect whether an organism's alleles are dominant or recessive. Here are some ways inheritance patterns can affect alleles:\nAn autosomal inheritance pattern may have alleles that are dominant or recessive.\nA X-linked inheritance pattern has a dominant allele and a recessive allele. The dominant allele is called X and the recessive allele is called y. An organism with at least one X allele will have the X allele's version of the trait. An organism with only y alleles will have the y allele's version of the trait.\nA Y-linked inheritance pattern has a dominant allele and a recessive allele. The dominant allele is called Y and the recessive allele is called y. An organism with at least one Y allele will have the Y allele's version of the trait. An organism with only y alleles will have the y allele's version of the trait.\nConsanguinity can tell you how closely related two people are. This information can help predict an organism's inheritance pattern.\nAn organism with parents who are consanguineous has parents with at least one matching allele. An organism with parents who are consanguineous is autosomal or X-linked.\nAn organism with parents who are non-consanguineous has parents with no matching alleles. An organism with parents who are non-consanguineous is Y-linked."}
