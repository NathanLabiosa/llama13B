The average price level may rise because prices have gone up, or because the money supply has increased.\nWhen the average price level rises, each unit of currency is worth less than it was before. This decrease in the value of money is called inflation. Inflation will happen if the supply of money increases more quickly than the supply of goods and services.\nThere are many things that can cause the supply of money to increase more quickly than the supply of goods and services. For example, the government can increase the money supply by printing more money. Or, banks can create new money by making more loans.\nThe link between money supply and inflation is not always direct. For example, the price level rose sharply during the 1970s, but the money supply did not increase dramatically until the 1980s. In the 1970s, the money supply increased at a steady rate, but the price level continued to rise. This unusual linkage was caused by other factors, such as the oil crisis of the 1970s.\nThe price level and the rate of inflation change over time. For example, the price level may rise during times of war, and it may fall during times of peace. The rate of inflation is affected by many short-term and long-term factors, such as the amount of money in circulation, the growth of the economy, and the prices of important goods and services.\nSOLUTION: To control for inflation and PPP-adjustment, the GDP per capita is divided by the price index. The price index measures the average price level. By dividing GDP per capita by the price index, you can compare the real GDP per capita to the average price level.\nThe price index is measured in terms of a base year. The base year is the year that has an index value of 100. For example, if the base year price index is 100, then the price of a good or service in that year is equal to 1.\nThe following graph shows how the real GDP per capita in Japan changed from 1950 to 2016. The GDP per capita is raised to the 15th power. This means that a country with a GDP per capita of 100 in 1950 would have a GDP per capita of 10,000 in 2016."}

For example, if the GDP per capita is higher in Country A than in Country B, then people in Country A are, on average, richer than people in Country B.\nSOLUTION: To adjust for inflation and PPP, you need to calculate how much the GDP per capita in 1950 would be worth in 2011.\nThe table below shows how the GDP per capita in the United States changed between 1950 and 2011.\nYear | GDP per capita in 2011 dollars\n1950 | 8,000\n1960 | 11,000\n1990 | 20,000\n2000 | 32,000\n2011 | 50,000\nYou can see that the GDP per capita in the United States increased by about 50% from 1950 to 2011.

{"question": "Public spending on education in the world is about what percentage of global GDP as of 2017?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "1%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8%"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In many countries, public spending on education is one of the largest items of government expenditure. In some countries, it is the largest item.\nThe government of a country decides how much money to spend on education. Some of the factors that can influence this decision include:\nThe size of the country. The amount of public spending on education in a country is often proportional to the size of the country. A larger country will usually spend more on education.\nThe number of people in the country. The amount of public spending on education in a country is also often based on the number of people in the country. A country with more people will usually spend more on education.\nThe government's budget. If a country has a large budget surplus (the government has more money coming in than it needs to pay for expenditures), it is likely to spend more on education. If a country has a budget deficit (the government has more money going out than it takes in), it is likely to spend less on education.\nSOLUTION: To find the percentage of global GDP spent on education in 2017, follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total amount of global GDP in 2017.\n2. Calculate the total amount of public spending on education in the world in 2017.\n3. Divide the amount of public spending on education by the total amount of global GDP.\n4. Multiply the result by 100 to find the percentage of global GDP spent on education in 2017."}
