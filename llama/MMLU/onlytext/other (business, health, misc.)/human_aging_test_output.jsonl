Some differences between age groups are due to cohort, or the year in which a person was born. Other differences are due to age.\nCohort refers to the year in which a person was born. People who were born in the same year share a common cohort.\nAge refers to how old a person is. Every year, people who are born later will be younger in age than people who were born earlier.\nSOLUTION: One difference that seems to be mostly cohort rather than age is the difference in coping strategies for different age groups.\nDuring their lifetimes, people born in different decades may have developed different coping strategies. For example, people born in the 1940 s and 1950 s may have different coping strategies because they grew up in different times.\nBut age can also affect coping strategies. For example, older people may have developed more effective coping strategies over their lifetimes."}

A gene is a piece of hereditary material that contains the instructions that affect inherited traits. Genes may have different forms, or alleles, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have types of alleles, or versions, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, the gene for flower color in pea plants has two possible alleles.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSOLUTION: Activation of a class of genes called sirtuins may help to increase memory and intelligence. This passage suggests that sirtuins can help to prevent some diseases and ward off dementias."}

Some cohort effects are due to the environment, but many are due to changes in lifestyle and behavior that are passed from parents to their children.\nFor example, the incidence of heart disease has increased over the past century. One of the reasons for this increase is the cohort effect. People born in the 1920s and 1930s, when heart disease was rare, had different lifestyles and eating habits than people born in the 1950s and 1960s, when heart disease was more common.\nSOLUTION: Depression, alcoholism, and suicide are not cohort effects. These conditions are not affected by the time period in which a person was born.\nDementia is a possible cohort effect. The incidence of dementia increases with age. However, the effect is due to the aging of the population, not to changes in lifestyle or the environment that occurred during a person's lifetime."}

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling.

For example, as people age, they lose muscle and gain fat. This change is called sarcopenia and adiposity.\nSome discontinuous changes are caused by the environment. For example, smoking is a discontinuous change that can happen when a person begins smoking. Smoking is a behavior that is caused by the environment."}

But many physical changes are not avoidable.\nPhysical changes can occur for everyone. For example, walking on hard surfaces can cause the bones to lose calcium and get weaker. But walking on soft surfaces can help maintain bone strength.\nSome physical changes occur more for some people than for others. For example, riding a bicycle a lot can make some people's legs stronger.\nMany physical changes occur for very old people in the same way they occur for younger people. For example, heart problems may occur more often for very old people than for younger people, but spending too much time in the sun can cause problems for both very old and younger people.\nMany physical changes can be totally avoided. For example, chopping wood can cause splinters. But if you avoid chopping wood, you will avoid getting splinters.\nSOLUTION: This change occurs for everyone."}

This pattern is controlled by an internal \"clock\" in the brain.\nWhen you sleep, your body's internal clock tells your brain to release hormones that make you feel sleepy. Your body also uses the hormones to help you relax and fall asleep.\nIf you are exposed to bright light in the morning, your brain will start to release these hormones earlier. This can help you feel more awake and alert.\nIf you are exposed to bright light in the evening, your brain will start to release these hormones later. This can help you feel drowsier and more ready for sleep.\nSOLUTION: Bright light during the later parts of the day can increase insomnia.\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder. It can make it hard to fall asleep, stay asleep, or both.\nBright light can make it harder to fall asleep. This is because the light can change the natural production of the sleep hormone melatonin in the body.\nMelatonin helps control your body's sleep-wake cycle. When it gets dark, your brain starts to release melatonin. This tells your body that it is time to sleep."}

This increase is due to medical breakthroughs, advances in technology, and better health habits. But life expectancy at a specified age has not increased as much. For example, a 60-year-old man in 1900 could expect to live about 12 more years, but a 60-year-old man today can expect to live about 20 more years.\nSOLUTION: The Baby Boom generation refers to the children born in the United States after World War II, from 1946 to 1964. This generation is a major reason for the increase in numbers of older adults.\nThe steadily increasing birth rate means that more babies were born during a specific period. This increase in the number of babies born will affect the number of older adults in the future.\nIncreases in life expectancy at birth and at a specified age are major reasons for the increase in numbers of older adults. As life expectancy at birth and at a specified age have increased, the number of older adults has also increased."}

For example, an organism's genes may have different effects on its survival and reproduction. These opposite effects are called antagonistic pleiotropy.\nAn organism's genes may have antagonistic pleiotropy when the genes that help the organism survive and reproduce in the short term have negative effects in the long term. This contradiction can cause a conflict within an organism.\nAn organism's genes may have pleiotropy when the genes have multiple effects. Some of these effects may be helpful and others harmful.\nSOLUTION: One line of evidence against antagonistic pleiotropy is that some animals show little or no senescence. Senescence is the decline in an organism's survival and reproduction with age. If antagonistic pleiotropy were true, then we would expect to see senescence in all animals."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, discovered the rules for inheritance in the 1860 s. Mendel's work was forgotten for many years, but it was later found and is now considered the foundation of genetics.\nMendel's rules for inheritance are as follows:\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nOffspring receive their genes, and therefore inherit their observable traits, from their parents.\nAn organism's genes may have different forms, or alleles. These alleles can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSOLUTION: An organism's telomere length is determined by its parents. Telomere length is a trait in people. It is affected by both genetic and environmental factors.\nTelomere length is not determined by climate or the time of year a person is born. It is not determined by a person's diet or exercise."}

In the front of the eye is a clear covering called the cornea. In the back of the cornea is the lens. The lens focuses light on the retina, a layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. The retina sends signals about the light it detects to the brain, which interprets them as images.\nWhen the pressure inside the eye is too high, it can damage the delicate nerve fibers in the retina. These nerve fibers carry signals about what you are seeing to the brain. With glaucoma, the brain receives garbled signals, and your vision becomes slowly worse.\nGlaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But with early detection and treatment, you can often protect your vision.\nSOLUTION: The pressure in the eye increases when the flow of fluid out of the eye is slowed. This increased pressure can damage the nerve fibers in the retina. So, fluid pressure in the eye is above normal."}

These negative beliefs may be influenced by negative stereotypes about older memory.\nNegative stereotypes about older memory: Older adults may be exposed to negative stereotypes about memory as they age. These stereotypes may seem to justify older adults' concerns about their memories and may make their memory problems seem more severe than they actually are.\nTime of day and weather conditions: Time of day and weather conditions can affect anyone's memory. Older adults may be more affected by these factors. For example, older adults may have more difficulty remembering things in the evening or on rainy days. But these factors do not seem to be the main reason older adults have negative beliefs about their memories.\nWho they are speaking with: People often have trouble remembering things when they are speaking with someone they do not know well. This social pressure may be more difficult for older adults to handle than for younger adults. But older adults' negative beliefs about their memories do not seem to be affected by who they are speaking with.\nTheir slower processing speed: Older adults' negative beliefs about their memories are related to their slower processing speed. Processing speed is the time it takes for the brain to do its basic functions. As people age, their processing speed tends to slow down. This slowing may make it seem like older adults are having more memory problems than they actually are."}

This damage can cause instructions to be sent to cells that lead to aging and disease.\nThe DNA damage can come from many sources. Some sources of DNA damage are:\nFree radicals and sunlight: Free radicals are highly reactive chemicals that are produced during cellular metabolism. Free radicals can damage DNA. Sunlight can cause free radicals to react with DNA.\nMetabolic processes: Many metabolic processes can damage DNA. For example, when cells break down sugar, they produce a chemical called methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal can damage DNA.\nTelomerase: Telomerase is an enzyme that can repair and rebuild telomeres. Telomeres are the repetitive sequences of DNA at the ends of chromosomes. As cells age, their telomeres shorten. When telomeres get too short, the cell can no longer divide. Telomerase can help to rebuild telomeres. But if telomerase is overactive, it can lead to cancer.\nRadiation from antioxidants: Antioxidants are chemicals that can neutralize free radicals.

While it is true that memory can change as people age, for most people, memory does not have to decline. Normal aging does not mean that people have to get Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia.\n2. Learn techniques to improve memory. There are many ways to improve memory. For example, you can use mnemonic strategies to help you remember things. Mnemonic strategies are techniques that use words, images, or associations to help you remember information. Another strategy is to make sure you have a good sleep routine. SOLUTION: Older adults can improve their memories and reduce their anxiety about declining memory when they learn about memory and aging and learn some techniques."}

It is used for thinking, learning, and reasoning.\nWorking memory is often called the mind's \"workspace.\" It allows you to hold and use information that is needed for complex tasks. For example, working memory is used to keep track of numbers and facts during mental arithmetic.\nResearchers believe that working memory is made up of a limited number of independent units. When these units are full, they can't hold any more information. This idea is shown in the diagram below.\nThe amount of information that can be held in each unit is limited. So, the number of items that can be held in working memory is limited."}

Each of these perspectives is a set of beliefs about how people develop. Some perspectives emphasize the role of heredity (nature) in human development, while others emphasize the role of the environment (nurture).\nOrganismic perspective: People develop as organisms. This means that heredity and the environment interact to affect human development.\nNurture perspective: People develop as mammals. As mammals, people have both inherited and learned traits. The environment influences how people inherit and learn traits.\nContinuity perspective: People develop as organisms. Human beings continue to be organisms. This means that people's behavior changes as they grow. But, the type of person who a person is does not change.\nMechanistic perspective: People are like machines. This perspective assumes that people are made up of parts. These parts can be studied and understood separately. If one part of a machine is damaged, the machine will not function properly.
