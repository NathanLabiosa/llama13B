One of the earliest and most influential theories is mass society theory.\nMass society theory argues that mass communication and the spread of mass media have altered the way society functions. In a mass society, the range of social issues and the number of people involved in addressing them have increased. This has led to a decline in traditional social institutions and a corresponding increase in the power of mass-media institutions.\nAccording to mass society theory, the content of the media is determined by market forces, and audiences are passive and vulnerable to the manipulations of media executives. However, this theory does not acknowledge the active and creative ways that people interpret media messages.\nAnother problem with the mass society theory is that it assumes a homogenous audience. In reality, people have different backgrounds, experiences, and interpretations. As a result, people do not all interpret media messages in the same way.\nSOLUTION: The mass society theory does not provide an accurate description of the way media function. The content of the media is not determined by market forces alone. The subordinate classes are not simply dominated by the ideology of the ruling class. Audiences do not passively accept media messages. And audiences are not all the same.\nInstead, the media reflect and serve the interests of the dominant groups in society. People use the media to access information and to learn about the social world. But people also use media to escape from reality. And people interpret media messages in different ways, depending on their personal experiences and cultural backgrounds."}

These norms are called flexible norms.\nFlexible norms are broken when it is convenient or when they can be enforced. For example, driving 5 miles per hour above the speed limit is illegal, but it is a norm that is frequently broken. Drivers may exceed the speed limit when they are running late or when they are driving on an empty road.\nA deviant act becomes normalized when it is performed so often that it is no longer seen as a problem.\nA deviant act may be seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character when it is still being perceived as a problem, but it is not yet considered normal. For example, many people believe that smoking should be restricted in public places. While many people still smoke in public places, most people consider smoking to be a deviant act. But it is still a deviant act that is performed frequently. So, it is not yet normal.\nA deviant career is a series of deviant acts that are performed with such frequency that they become a person's 'career.' A person who breaks into houses for a living is engaging in a deviant career.\nA deviant act is attributed to a person's genetic or anatomical make up when it is considered to be a result of that person's nature. Most people do not consider a deviant act to be a result of their nature. Instead, they see a deviant act as a result of their environment. For example, people do not consider a person's homosexuality to be a deviant act.\nSOLUTION: A deviant act is recognized as breaking an important norm of behavior when it is no longer seen as a problem. The first step in establishing a deviant career is the third step in normalizing a deviant act. To establish a deviant career, a person must perform a deviant act so frequently that it becomes a career.\nA deviant act is attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical make up when it is considered to be a result of that person's nature. But a deviant act is never a result of a person's genetic or anatomical make up."}

This approach is based on the assumption that the old left-right dichotomy is no longer a useful way to understand the choices facing society.\nThe third way seeks to balance the free-market, market-oriented approach of the right with the concern for equal opportunities and equal access to resources that has been a hallmark of the traditional left. This balanced approach is based on the following principles:\n1. A commitment to social-market capitalism, which is a blend of free-market principles and government intervention.\n2. A focus on social investment, which involves creating the conditions for economic growth and social development.\n3. A commitment to civil society, which is the realm of voluntary associations and institutions that are separate from the government and the market.\nThe third way does not seek to return to the old, state-dominated economy of the past. Instead, it seeks to use the tools of the market to promote social welfare.\nSOLUTION: Giddens (1998) defines the following terms of New Labour's 'third way':\nPositive welfare: 'a hand up, not a hand-out'.\nThe democratization of the family.\nThe strengthening of civil society.\nPutting an end to privatization is not defined by Giddens (1998)."}

It is characterized by a belief in what is right and a concern for what is good.\n3. Affective: This type of action is based on emotions. It is characterized by a concern for a feeling.\n4. Instrumental: This type of action is based on a desire to achieve a goal.

A word may start out with one meaning, but if people begin using it in a different way, then the word's meaning may change.\nWhen a word's meaning changes, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\nSOLUTION: Assistant: In the 1800 s, the term assimilation was used to describe the process of absorbing immigrants into American society. So, when policy makers talked about assimilation after slavery was abolished, they meant that former slaves would be absorbed into American society. This assimilation would involve former slaves becoming indistinguishable from other Americans."}

Other social facts, such as ways of thinking and believing, can be studied sociologically.\nDurkheim believed that sociologists could use their knowledge of social facts to improve society. For example, by studying how the rich and poor live, Durkheim sought to explain how social facts related to class affect ways of thinking and believing."}

It is a social science that explores the ways in which social norms and rules are created, maintained, and changed.\nAuguste Comte is known for his work in founding the field of sociology. He believed that social behavior was subject to the same laws and patterns of change as natural phenomena.\nIn the early 1800s, Comte began to develop a systematic approach to studying human social behavior. He created the term \"sociology\" to describe this new field of study.\nComte's ideas had a significant influence on the development of sociology as a discipline. However, other theorists have added to our understanding of sociology.\nRobert K. Merton is known for his work in the area of sociological theory. Merton developed a series of concepts to help explain how societies and individuals behave.\nMerton's work helped to advance our understanding of social norms and the factors that can affect the behavior of individuals and groups.\nKarl Marx is known for his work in the area of sociological theory. Marx developed a theory of historical materialism, which explores the ways in which economic conditions shape society.\nMarx believed that the way that people earn a living influences the types of social institutions that develop in a society.\nEmile Durkheim is known for his work in the area of sociological theory. Durkheim was one of the first scholars to study how social institutions affect individual behavior.\nDurkheim believed that social institutions, such as governments and churches, can have a powerful influence on individual actions."}

These changes have affected the ways in which families live and interact.\nAnthropologists use the terms traditional and modern to describe ways of life. A traditional society is one in which many people live a rural, agricultural lifestyle. Traditional societies may be organized by clan or tribe, and social roles are often determined by birth. A modern society is one in which many people live in cities and work in industrial or service jobs. Modern societies often have more social classes than traditional societies, and individuals are responsible for achieving their own success.\nThe ways in which people live have changed in different ways in different societies. Therefore, there is no absolute line between traditional and modern. Instead, there are many types of societies, including:\nTraditional societies: Most people live in rural areas and work in agriculture.\nTransitional societies: Some people live in cities and work in industrial or service jobs, but many people still live in rural areas and work in agriculture.\nModern societies: Most people live in cities and work in industrial or service jobs.\nPostmodern societies: Many people work in service jobs, and the economy is focused on services rather than on industry."}

It was the result of a combination of economic, social, and political factors. One of the key factors was the development of new religious movements that challenged the traditional social and economic order.\nMany early religious reformers believed that the Church should not own the means of production. They argued that this was incompatible with the teachings of Jesus and the Gospels. As a result, many of these reformers ended up embracing labor as a spiritual vocation. By doing so, they rejected the idea that work was a form of punishment for sin. This rejection helped to create a spirit of capitalism, which valued hard work, thrift, and individual effort.\nSOLUTION: Weber believed that the spirit of capitalism could be traced back to inspirational Protestant groups who revived religious ideas. These groups rejected the authority of the Catholic Church and sought to create a direct relationship with God. This emphasis on individual conscience and experience prepared the way for the social and economic changes that accompanied the rise of capitalism."}

Over the past few decades, environmental movements have become increasingly global. This means that people from around the world work together to address environmental issues.\nEnvironmental movements have globalized in three ways:\n1. Awareness of global risks: Environmental movements have helped to increase awareness of environmental risks that affect the whole planet. For example, global warming is a major concern for environmentalists. They have generated publicity and support for policies to address global warming, which is a universal risk that affects the entire world.\n2. Appeal to universal values and human rights: Environmental movements appeal to universal values and human rights. Many people believe that humans have a right to live in an environment that is safe and sustainable. Environmental movements appeal to this belief, using it to promote change.\n3. Use of global media: Environmental movements use global media to generate publicity for their cause. For example, a group of activists might stage a protest that is covered by news media outlets around the world. This publicity helps to increase awareness of the cause and to put pressure on decision-makers to address the issue."}

Gender roles are the behaviors and activities that society thinks are appropriate for men and women. Some gender roles, such as cooking and cleaning, are strongly associated with either men or women. Other roles, such as being a nurse or a construction worker, are associated more with men or women, but these associations are not as strong.\nHow do societies differ in their gender socialization?\nSome societies socialize men and women to be quite equal in their roles and activities. In these societies, men and women are encouraged to develop skills and interests in any area.\nOther societies have very clear expectations about how men and women should behave. In these societies, men are often expected to be financially responsible and decision-makers, while women are often expected to be nurturing and supportive."}

In the United States, for example, the educational landscape has changed over the past century from a rural, one-room schoolhouse to a urban, centralized high school.\nThe 20th-century trend in schools has been toward larger schools and higher schooling. The number of high schools increased from 17,000 in 1900 to 30,000 in 1950 to 55,000 in 1990. The size of the average high school increased from 450 students in 1920 to 800 students in 1950 to 1,400 students in 1990.\nThe trend toward larger schools has been accompanied by a trend toward more tracking, grouping, and ability grouping. In 1988, 58% of 12th graders in the United States attended schools that tracked students by ability, up from 33% in 1978.\nSOLUTION: In the 1960s, comprehensive schools did not eradicate class inequalities in education because:\nthey tended to recruit pupils from the inner cities and traditionally working class areas,\nselective schools could still 'cream off' the most able pupils, while the comprehensives put children into ability streams,\nteachers in comprehensive schools used the restricted code in the classroom, whereas working class pupils used elaborated codes of speech,\nnational testing and league tables made the new schools highly competitive and selective."}

By doing so, you can tell whether the part that is different or unexpected is responsible for the experiment's results.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what to test?\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that is different or unexpected. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, make sure that the part of the experiment that is the same for each test is also the same. In order to do this, you need to plant each type of soil with the same type of plant.\nIf you have different types of soil and can plant the same type of plant in each type of soil, you are ready to do an experiment!\nYou can use the experiment to answer your question.

Some theories may be tested by observing what happens in a social situation and comparing these observations to the details of the theory.\nThink about a social phenomenon and how it might be explained by a theory. For example, look at the table below and think about how it might be explained by each of the following theories.\nTheory | Key parts | Explanation\nValues-added | social norms, expectations | People have certain expectations for how others will behave. When these expectations are met, people often continue to follow social norms.\nConvergence | social norms, personal interests | People often come to share social norms when they interact with others over time. Coming to share norms can help people work together to achieve common goals.\nEmergent-norm | social norms, repeated behaviors | New social norms can emerge when people spontaneously start behaving in a new way that is personally or socially rewarding.\nRole-diffusion | social norms, roles | People often learn about the social expectations for their role in society.

Today, for the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. This trend is called urbanization.\nUrbanization can bring many benefits. For example, cities can offer better jobs and opportunities than rural areas. The goods and services in cities are also often cheaper. Because so many people live in cities, they can be centers of culture and education.\nBut urbanization can also have negative effects. Many cities in the world are overcrowded. Overcrowding can make it difficult to find a job and have a good standard of living. Cities can also be polluted.

The culture industry was a system in which companies created cultural products, such as movies, records, and advertisements, for mass consumption. These companies sold their products to the general public in order to make a profit.\nThe culture industry played a role in the society of the 1960s. The industry produced mass culture that was designed to appeal to the masses. The industry also controlled the means of production for cultural products, which allowed it to decide what products were produced and what ideas were expressed in the products. This control made it difficult for subcultures and countercultures to emerge, since these groups could not easily produce their own cultural products.\nHowever, the development of new technologies, such as the Internet, has changed the way in which cultural products are produced and distributed. The globalization of culture through new technologies has led to the creation of a global market for cultural products. This has allowed subcultures and countercultures to use the Internet to produce and distribute their own cultural products."}

But in the late 1800s and early 1900s, many of these programs became secular, or not specifically linked to a religion.\nSecular institutions are based on the idea that the secular world itself is sacred. They are not affiliated with any particular religion, but they may have a religious aspect. For example, a hospital may not be affiliated with a particular religion, but it may have a chapel.\nSecular institutions are voluntary.

People use the distinctions of gender to make social and cultural sense of the world. These distinctions are not based on any inherent or essential differences between men and women. Rather, they are created by social and cultural norms. As a result, gender is performed and re-performed constantly across countless social and cultural situations.\nJudith Butler's book Gender Trouble (1990) was a turning point in the study of gender. She argued that gender is a performance. It is a set of roles and behaviors that are expected of people based on their perceived gender. This performance is not based on any inherent or essential differences. Instead, it is based on social and cultural norms.\nSocial norms for gender are created and maintained by the actions of individuals and groups. These norms can change over time. For example, conventional gender roles and expectations have changed significantly over the past few decades.\nSOLUTION: The 'two-sex' model replaced the 'one-sex' model in the eighteenth century.\nThe 'one-sex' model held that all people are essentially the same in terms of their sex. This model was replaced by the 'two-sex' model, which recognized that there are two sexes, male and female."}

Many people have come to see these justifications as unacceptable. We examine some of the ways in which people have tried to justify their discrimination against others in the past.\n'Civilized' and 'uncivilized'\nIn the past, many people believed in a sort of \"civilization\" hierarchy. They believed that some people were more civilized than others. They said that people who were not as civilized were not as good.\nThis way of thinking was used to justify discrimination against many groups of people. But what made someone \"civilized\"?\nMany people believed that civilized people acted like those from northern Europe. They believed that people from other parts of the world were not as civilized. So, people from Africa, Asia, and the Americas were often considered inferior.\n'Scientific' racism\nIn the 1800s, some people tried to make their discrimination seem more scientific. They tried to show that some groups of people were biologically inferior to others.\nOne scientist, Samuel Morton, studied the skulls of people from many different groups. Morton believed that the shape of a person's skull revealed their intelligence. He ranked different groups of people according to their skull shapes. Morton believed that some groups of people were smarter than others.\nBut Morton's ideas were not true. Experiments have shown that people of all skull shapes can be intelligent.\n'The underclass'\nIn the 1900s, some people used the term \"underclass\" to describe poor people. They believed that some people were morally inferior and wouldfully remained poor.\nThis way of thinking is not true. Poor people are not inherently morally inferior. But they may have fewer choices and fewer resources.\nSOLUTION: The underclass was a term used to describe poor people. But the underclass is not a race. So, the choice is incorrect.\nMany people received welfare benefits. But receiving welfare benefits does not mean that someone is morally inferior. So, the choice is incorrect.\nLiving morally unsound lives of crime and squalor did not describe the underclass. So, the choice is incorrect."}

When designing a study, you need to figure out what will be measured and what will be counted as data. These decisions are important because they affect the study's results.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what to measure and what to count as data in this study?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the study that will be measured and tested. This is called the independent variable. In order to do this, you need to decide what will be different or changed in the study. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the study that will be observed and recorded. This is called the dependent variable. In order to do this, you need to decide what will be counted or measured after the independent variable is set up. In this case, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you can have different types of soil and observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you are ready to do the study!\nSOLUTION: The results based on the returned questionnaires are most likely contaminated by response rate bias.\nResponse rate bias occurs when the people who answer a questionnaire are not a random part of the group being studied. This bias can affect survey results."}

They argue that many of our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors are based on assumptions that cannot be supported by careful analysis. These assumptions are known as \"grand narratives.\" Postmodernists say that grand narratives are illusions because they do not stand up to careful analysis.\nFor example, one grand narrative is that humans have a fixed nature. This idea is often used to justify the status quo and to discriminate against those who are different. But if we examine the evidence, we can see that humans are flexible and that our abilities and behaviors change depending on the situation.\nPostmodernists also argue that grand narratives are used to maintain the power of those in power. For example, the grand narrative of the American Dream claims that anyone can be successful if they work hard enough. This narrative tries to justify inequality and social immobility by placing the blame on individuals who have not achieved success."}

The mode of production can change, and when it does, the entire superstructure changes.\nFor example, in a capitalist society, the mode of production is capitalism. In a capitalist society, individuals or companies own the resources that are used to produce goods and services. Individuals or companies compete with each other to make products and sell them. Winners in this competition can earn large profits.\nIn a socialist society, the mode of production is socialism.

Functionalism: This perspective views society as a system of interdependent and coordinated parts. It sees social institutions as being made up of interrelated parts that work together to keep the system functioning. Functionalism focuses on how parts of society contribute to maintaining equilibrium and solidarity.\n2. Conflict theory: This perspective views society as being in a state of perpetual conflict and change. It sees social life as a zero-sum game in which one group's gain is another group's loss. Conflict theory focuses on how parts of society are in conflict with each other and how these conflicts produce change.\n3. Symbolic interactionism: This perspective views society as a product of the interactions that people have with each other. It sees individuals as acting within situations and as creating their own meanings. Symbolic interactionism focuses on how people interact and how the meanings they create affect their actions.\n4. Role theory: This perspective views society as being made up of social roles and expectations. It sees individuals as acting in ways that are expected for their social positions. Role theory focuses on the social roles that people play and on how these roles affect their behavior.\n5. Feminist theory: This perspective views society as being characterized by systems of power and dominance. It focuses on how those systems of power and dominance affect women and how they can be changed.

They examine social institutions, or the structures that form the basis of society, and they investigate the norms, or unwritten rules, that guide behaviour in social situations.\nSociologists have a few different theories about why anorexia is more prevalent in some countries than in others. One theory is that anorexia is a result of the social construction of mental illness. In the past, people did not consider severe dieting to be a mental disorder. But as societies have learned to consider disorders such as depression and anxiety as mental illnesses, behaviours such as disordered eating have come to be seen as symptoms of mental illness.\nAnother theory is that anorexia is a result of the social construction of femininity. In many societies, women are expected to be thin, feminine, and attractive. These cultural norms may lead some women to try to embody the ideal of slim, attractive women.\nA third theory is that anorexia is a result of the changing expectations of women in society. In many countries, women are now expected to be highly achieving and self-assured. These new norms may be more difficult to achieve than the traditional expectations for women. As some women struggle to meet these new expectations, they may be more likely to develop anorexia."}

The self is a social self, composed of the I and the me. The I is the self that we are aware of as an individual, and the me is the self that we are aware of as an object in the minds of others.\nMead proposed that humans develop an understanding of the self through their interactions with others. As we interact with others, we learn to identify ourselves as objects in the minds of others. This self-awareness of the self as an object leads to what Mead called the generalized other. The generalized other is an imaginary figure that represents the expectations of the wider society. As we interact with others and learn to identify ourselves as objects in their minds, the generalized other becomes more real to us. We become aware of the generalized other when we are children, and we learn the values and norms of our society by imagining how the generalized other would act."}

This can make workers feel like parts of a machine, rather than self-realizing humans.\n2. The product they were making: Capitalists are motivated by the need to make a profit, which can lead to workers being treated as expendable resources.

Most working-class people worked in manufacturing industries, and they shared common experiences that formed the basis of their identity. For example, they all did manual labor, and they all worked for wages. They also had jobs that were interchangeable with those of their colleagues, which gave them a sense of equality with one another.\nSOLUTION: Traditional working-class identity was not based on shared leisure pursuits, collective aspirations to move into the middle class, or local communities and extended kinship networks.\nMost working-class people lived in urban areas, and their communities were not as tightly knit as those in rural areas.

Advanced industrial technology strengthens the power of totalitarian regimes by allowing them to control their economies and societies. But totalitarian regimes are incompatible with the requirements of modern technology.\nCommunist societies disperse power between various political parties. This dispersal of power can make it difficult for a communist society to gather the resources and make the decisions needed to pursue a space program.\nDemocratic governments serve the interests of a ruling elite. In some countries, a powerful ruling elite has more influence on government decisions than does the general population. But democratic governments, in which people have a say in government decisions, can better serve the needs of the people.\nThe case of the former Soviet Union supports Kerr et al.'s claim that totalitarian regimes are incompatible with the requirements of advanced industrial technology. The Soviet Union had a totalitarian government when it launched its first man into space in 1961. But the Soviet Union's space program was not as successful as those of democratic countries such as the United States."}

This is called the theory of development.\nThere are many theories of development, but they can be grouped into four main theories.\nModernization theory suggests that as a society becomes more modern, its economy becomes more industrialized, and its population grows. This theory sees modernization as a linear process, with each society progressing through the stages at its own speed.\nWesternization theory suggests that the modernization process is triggered by the adoption of Western (i.e., European) models of economic, political, and social organization. This theory sees modernization as a one-way street, with societies following the same path of development.\nDependency theory argues that modernization is impossible in many societies because they are trapped in a cycle of dependency. According to this theory, the wealthy countries of the world have maintained their power by keeping the less powerful countries in a state of dependency.\nWorld-systems theory sees the modernized societies of the world as being organized into a single world system, with less powerful societies being relegated to the role of peripheral countries.

Today, the United States is dominated by the service sector, which is made up of jobs in retail, finance, education, and health care.\nThe service sector has become dominant because of several major trends. One is that manufacturing jobs have been outsourced to other countries, where labor is cheaper. Another trend is that service sector jobs have grown to become a larger part of the economy. In addition, many new companies and start-ups are in the service sector.\nSOLUTION: The shift towards a service economy, based on knowledge and information, is the key difference between the 'industrial society' Bell identified and the 'post-industrial society.'

Unions wanted to be part of the decision-making process for laws and regulations that affected workers.\nSecond, incorporation meant creating links between the state and corporate organizations. Union leaders tried to persuade government officials to regulate businesses. They wanted the government to set standards for wages, hours, and working conditions.\nThird, incorporation meant including working class organizations in political bargaining and representation. Unions wanted to bargain with employers over wages, hours, and working conditions. They also wanted to elect candidates who supported their interests to public office."}

It is made up of both the people who produce goods and services and the people who buy them. This system is centered on the capitalist mode of production, which is a way of organizing economic activity.\nIn a capitalist system, private individuals or companies own themeans of production. The means of production include the tools, machines, and other equipment needed to produce goods and services. Under a capitalist system, private individuals or companies also control themeans of distribution and sale.\nThe world system has been criticized for its unequal distribution of wealth and power. On one side of the world system, there are rich countries and rich people. On the other side, there are poor countries and poor people.\nSOLUTION: The capitalist world economy is a world system. It is a system with a division of labor that extends across ethnic and cultural groups.\nThe capitalist world economy has four components:\nLabor: people who work and earn a living.\nCapital: tools, machines, and other equipment used to produce goods and services.\nProductive resources: land, labor, and capital.\nProduction: the use of productive resources to create goods and services.\nIn a world system, some parts of the world have an advantage in one or more of these components. As a result, they can use them to produce goods and services more efficiently. This efficiency allows them to sell goods and services at lower prices than other parts of the world can.\nFor example, China has an advantage in labor. China has a large population. This means that China can have many workers produce goods and services at a lower cost than some other countries. So, many companies move part of their production to China in order to reduce their costs."}

Ethnic identity is not created by an objective criteria but is rather a subjective experience. For this reason, the choice \"the fragmented and pluralistic nature of ethnicity\" is incorrect.\nEthnic identity is not the imposition of a racial label on a minority by a powerful majority. Ethnicity is not the same as race, although race and ethnicity can both be used as categories of analysis.\nEthnic identity is not the objective categories of ethnicity used in the census.

In order to qualify for these benefits, individuals must meet certain income criteria. Means-tested benefits are not tied to a person's employment, so they are not considered welfare.\nA universalist system of welfare provides benefits to all citizens, regardless of income.

Many jobs that were common in the past are no longer common today.\nIn the 1800 s, most jobs were in agriculture or industry. Agriculture is the work of farming. Industry is the work of manufacturing, or making things. Many jobs were also in the armed services.\nIn the 1900 s, many jobs changed as a result of the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution was a period of change from 1750 to 1850 when manufacturing became the primary way countries made goods. The Industrial Revolution brought new jobs and changed the types of jobs people had.\nToday, many jobs are in the service sector. This term refers to the jobs that help people get the products and services they need. Some service-sector jobs are in retail businesses, where people sell goods to customers. Other service-sector jobs are in hospitals, schools, and government agencies.\nSOLUTION: Goldthorpe identified the 'professional class' as those in non-manual occupations, exercising authority on behalf of the state.\nGoldthorpe described the professional class as having high levels of education and authority. Members of the professional class work in non-manual jobs. They also exercise authority on behalf of the state.\nThe other groups Goldthorpe identified are the managerial class, the technical class, and the traditionally working class."}

These changes included the following:\n1. Industrialization: New technologies and ideas spurred economic growth and helped to build strong military machines.\n2. Nationalism: People began to think of themselves as citizens of their own nations, often with a sense of pride and loyalty. This made it easier for nation states to go to war with one another.\n3. Administrative and political changes: The rise of democratic governments and the decline of monarchies often made it easier for nations to take up arms.\n4. Economic competition: The desire to dominate global trade and markets could lead nations to war.\nSOLUTION: The world was divided into several rival overseas empires. This geographical competition made war more possible, as competing empires fought for land and resources.\nThe other choices are not fully correct.\nIndustrialization provided better transport, technology, and administration. But these changes did not directly cause war between nation states.\nThere was intense economic, political, and military competition. This competition helped make war between nation states more possible."}

This means that you need to become a part of the culture and learn its norms and values.\nAs a participant observer, you have a unique opportunity to learn about a culture. You can learn the norms and values by observing how people behave in different situations. You can also learn the values and norms by participating in the culture and talking with its members.\nParticipant observation can be a powerful research tool. But, like all research tools, it has its ethical limitations.\nOne of the ethical problems with covert participant observation is deceiving the respondents as to the reason for your presence. Covert participant observation is when you observe a culture without its members knowing that you are observing them. This technique can lead to misunderstandings and can make it difficult to write comprehensive fieldnotes or record conversations.\nSOLUTION: The best way to conduct participant observation is to be open with the people in the culture you are observing. They have a right to know that you are observing them. They may even want to help you observe them."}

Bell argued that the white-collar employees are being 'bourgeoisified' and that the white-collar workers are adopting the values and ways of life of the capitalists. This means that the white-collar workers are becoming more like capitalists in the ways that they think and live.\nThe embourgeoisement thesis helps to explain why the middle class is expanding. As the white-collar workers are 'bourgeoisified', they have more money to spend. This creates a demand for goods and services that are sold by the capitalists. As a result of this expansion of the middle class, the demand for goods and services increases. The capitalists then have more money to invest. In this way, the embourgeoisement thesis helps to explain the expansion of the middle class in terms of the workings of the capitalist market."}

The public sphere is where important decisions about politics, economics, and society are made. In the past, women were not allowed to participate in the public sphere, and women's activities were restricted to the private sphere.\nThe information below explains some of the reasons why women have been excluded from the public sphere.\nIndustrial capitalism separated the middle class home from the workplace.\nIn the past, women were excluded from the public sphere, where important decisions were made. This exclusion occurred during a time when women's roles were changing. Many women began to work outside the home in factories and other industries. But they were paid much less than men, and their work was considered to be in the lower rungs of the economic ladder.\nAs many women began working outside the home, they were no longer restricted to the private sphere. But they were still expected to perform most of the domestic duties. So, women were caught in the middle, without a clear place in the public sphere or the private sphere.\nThose who enter paid employment outside the home have been 'sidelined' into particular fields.\nMany women have had to take jobs outside the home because they had to earn money. But women have often been restricted to certain fields, such as teaching, nursing, or secretarial work. These fields are considered women's work, and they have lower pay and fewer opportunities for advancement than do other fields.\nIt is difficult to succeed in 'malestream' politics without compromising their femininity.\nPolitics has been a male-dominated field, and men have created the rules and expectations for this field. To be successful in politics, a woman has to follow these rules and expectations. But many of these rules and expectations are based on traditional ideas about femininity and masculinity. So, a woman who wants to succeed in politics has to compromise her femininity."}

Some of the decisions are about how to govern the country. These decisions are called political decisions.\nOther decisions are about how to use the country's resources. These decisions are called economic decisions.\nSome decisions involve both politics and economics. For example, deciding how to allocate money for scientific research is both a political and an economic decision.\nDomhoff identified four processes of decision-making in the United States.\nThe candidate-selection process is how the United States chooses its political candidates. To become a candidate, an individual often must be a registered member of a political party. The party will then hold primary elections to determine which candidate will run for office.\nThe exploitation process is how resources are taken from the environment. In the United States, this process often involves oil, gas, and coal. It can also involve logging, mining, and farming.\nThe policy-formation process is how the government forms its policies. Policies are plans for how to run the country. To form a policy, the government must decide on a course of action. This decision-making process can involve the president, Congress, and the courts.\nThe ideology process is the set of beliefs and values that Americans hold. These beliefs and values can affect how Americans vote and how they think the country should be governed.\nSOLUTION: Domhoff did not identify the ideology process as a decision-making process in the USA."}
