The supply of a good or service is determined by the cost of producing and selling it. The demand for a good or service is determined by its price and the quantity demanded.\nWhen the price of a good or service changes, the quantity demanded will change as well. If the price goes down, the quantity demanded will usually go up. If the price goes up, the quantity demanded will usually go down.\nThe marginal product of a good or service is the additional output produced when one more unit of a variable input is used. The marginal product of labor is the additional output produced when one more unit of labor is used. The marginal product of capital is the additional output produced when one more unit of capital is used.\nA firm will increase the input for which the marginal product is higher. For example, if the marginal product of labor is higher than the marginal product of capital, the firm will increase labor and decrease capital.\nSOLUTION: Look at the marginal products. The marginal product of labor is 200, and the marginal product of capital is 50. The marginal product of labor is higher. So, the firm should decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of labor rises and the marginal product of capital falls."}

When externalities exist, the market will not allocate resources to their most efficient use.\nAn externality affects social welfare. When externalities are present, the actual outcome will not be optimal for society as a whole.\nSOLUTION: An externality causes the equilibrium price to be artificially high.\nThe externality causes the equilibrium quantity to be less than the level that maximizes total benefit to society. This outcome is due to the fact that the equilibrium price is higher than it should be. At the higher price, consumers buy less of the good or service than they would if the price were lower. At the same time, the higher price leads to a lower quantity supplied than would be supplied if the price were lower."}

Firms may collude to set prices, reduce competition, or make other business decisions that limit the choices of consumers.\nSOLUTION: One reason why the government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry is that collusive output levels tend to decrease, driving the price down to competitive levels.\nWhen firms collude, they may choose to produce and sell less output at a lower price. This may result in a price that is below the competitive level. The competitive level is the price that a single firm could charge in the absence of other firms.\nIf the price is driven down to this level, the quantity demanded is also the competitive quantity. The sum of the quantities demanded by each firm in a colluding group is the collusive quantity. This quantity is less than the competitive quantity, and the total price at which it is sold is also lower.\nThe collusive arrangement can be expected to increase the firms' profits in the short run. However, in the long run, the firms will earn less because the price is below the competitive level. The competitive level is the price that maximizes the firms' profit."}

Oligopolistic firms make their decisions about production, pricing, and advertising in a strategic interdependence, which means that each firm must consider how its decisions will affect the decisions of other firms.\nFirms in an oligopoly face a demand curve that is highly elastic or highly inelastic. A highly elastic demand curve means that a small change in price will result in a larger-than-normal change in quantity demanded. A highly inelastic demand curve means that a small change in price will result in a smaller-than-normal change in quantity demanded.\nA oligopolist's demand curve is affected by the prices charged by rival firms. If rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase, the oligopolist's demand curve will consist of two discontinuous segments. The left segment has a relatively elastic demand curve, and the right segment has a relatively inelastic demand curve. This situation is known as a \"step\" in the demand curve.\nSOLUTION: A perfectly horizontal demand curve is not possible for a oligopolist. This is because a horizontal demand curve would mean that the oligopolist's price is constant across all levels of quantity demanded.

The supply curve for a good shows the relationship between the price of the good and the quantity supplied.\nIf the demand curve shifts, the price and quantity demanded will change. If the supply curve shifts, the price and quantity supplied will change.\nIf a substitute good becomes relatively less expensive, the demand for the good will decrease. If a complementary good becomes relatively more expensive, the demand for the good will decrease.\nSOLUTION: The equilibrium price and quantity of apples are affected by the changes in the apple market.\nThe use of more pesticides will increase the quantity of apples produced. As a result of increased production, the supply of apples will increase. The higher the supply of a good, the lower its price. So, the price of apples will fall.\nThe price of pears, a substitute for apples, is rising. As the price of pears rises, the quantity of pears demanded will decrease.

The schedules labeled (a) and (b) show two possible patterns for these curves.\nThe ATC curve is upward-sloping, which means that as the quantity produced increases, so does the average cost. This is because the firm must pay for the increased use of variable resources.\nThe AVC curve is upward-sloping, which means that as the quantity produced increases, so does the average cost. This is because the firm must pay for the increased use of variable resources.\nThe marginal cost (MC) curve is a step function. It has a different value at each level of output. For example, the marginal cost of producing one unit is different from the marginal cost of producing two units.\nSOLUTION: Look at the shapes of the curves.

The market is homogenous, and there are a large number of sellers. The products are also perfectly substitutable, meaning that one seller's product is as good as another seller's product.\nIn a monopolistically competitive market, sellers offer slightly differentiated products. The market is still homogenous, but sellers offer slight differences in their products. Because of these differences, each seller has some market power.\nAs a market goes from perfect competition to monopolistic competition, the barriers to entry increase. This increase in market power allows firms in monopolistically competitive markets to earn some short-run profits.\nBut in the long run, the number of firms in a monopolistically competitive market will increase. As the number of firms increases, the industry becomes more competitive. Eventually, the industry will become a perfectly competitive market. At that point, the industry will be homogenous, and there will be many sellers.\nSOLUTION: Both perfect competition and monopolistic competition are homogenous products. In a homogenous product market, the products sold by different firms are identical. As a result, consumers can switch between different firms' products at no additional cost.\nBoth perfect competition and monopolistic competition are also many-seller markets. In a many-seller market, there are many sellers in the market. This means that each seller has a small share of the market.\nIn the long run, the positive profits that a monopolistically competitive firm earns will attract new sellers to the market. The increase in the number of sellers will make the market more competitive. Eventually, the long-run profits will disappear, and the market will be a perfect competition."}

These costs are social costs. When the price of a good or service is set, it does not take into account the costs that are external to the people who are buying and selling it.\nAs a result of this market failure, the quantity of the good or service that is produced and sold could be too much. This can happen when the social cost is subsidized, or when the social cost is taxed.\nA subsidy is a payment made by the government to a person or company. When a subsidy is given to a person or company that is producing or selling a good or service, the subsidy will increase the supply of that good or service. This can drive the price of the good or service down to a level below the social cost.\nA tax is a payment made by a person or company to the government. When a tax is placed on a person or company that is producing or selling a good or service, the tax will decrease the supply of that good or service. This can drive the price of the good or service up to a level above the social cost.\nA. The free market will not take into account the external costs of a good or service. In the case of a negative externality, the free market will produce too much of the good or service.\nB. Placing limits on the quantity that can be produced will help to reduce the quantity of the good or service that is produced and sold. This will decrease the amount of the external cost that is created.\nC. Government purchases of the good will increase the demand for the good. This will drive the price of the good up. The increase in price will help to reduce the quantity of the good that is produced and sold. This will decrease the amount of the external cost that is created.\nD. Setting a minimum on the quantity that can be produced will not help to reduce the quantity of the good or service that is produced and sold. This is because the minimum price will be set below the social cost. The free market will not be able to respond to the minimum price, so the quantity of the good or service that is produced and sold will not decrease."}

For a profit maximizer, the quantity sold is determined by the intersection of the firm's demand curve and the market demand curve.\nThe market demand curve is perpendicular to the market price and has quantity demanded as the vertical axis. The demand curve for a firm is a horizontal line at the level of the market price. The point where the market demand curve and the firm's demand curve intersect is the quantity that will be sold at that price. This quantity is the profit-maximizing quantity.\nThe total cost of a profit maximizer is determined by the price at which a good or service is sold and the quantity sold. For a profit maximizer, the quantity sold is determined by the intersection of the firm's demand curve and the market demand curve.\nThe total cost of a profit maximizer is the sum of its total variable cost and total fixed cost. The total variable cost is determined by the quantity sold. The total fixed cost is determined by the price at which a good or service is sold.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether Jason should shut down in the short run, compare his total costs and total revenue.\nJason's total variable cost is $80. His total fixed cost is $20. So, Jason's total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.\nJason's total revenue is $10 per pool. So, Jason's total revenue is $10 per pool \u00d7 9 pools per day = $90 per day.\nJason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $20."}

Each consumer and producer wants to make choices that will make them as happy as possible. These choices involve giving up other things that they want or need. This process is called making trade-offs.\nMaking trade-offs can be difficult. Imagine that you are very thirsty. You want to drink. But if you drink too much, you will get sick. In this case, you have to make a trade-off. You can choose to drink more, or you can choose to drink less. There is no \"right\" amount of water to drink. The amount of water you choose to drink will affect how happy you are. But the amount of water you choose will also affect how healthy you are.\nMany resources are used to produce goods and services. These resources can be used to produce other goods and services. For example, land can be used to produce crops or to build homes. Labor can be used to produce goods and services, or it can be used to produce leisure time. Capital can be used to produce goods and services, or it can be used to provide investment income.\nProducers make trade-offs when they choose which resources to use. For example, a farmer must decide how much land to use for crops and how much land to use for pasture. Too much land will be used to produce crops, and not enough land will be used to produce food for the farmer's family.\nConsumers make trade-offs when they choose which goods and services to buy. For example, a consumer must decide which goods and services to buy with their money. The consumer cannot buy all of the goods and services they want.\nIn a competitive market, consumers and producers make trade-offs that lead to an outcome that is relatively good. This outcome is not the \"best\" that consumers and producers can do. But it is the best that consumers and producers can do on their own. In a competitive market, consumers and producers make trade-offs that increase consumer surplus and producer surplus.\nConsumer surplus is the difference between the maximum amount that a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price that the consumer pays.\nProducer surplus is the difference between the minimum amount that a producer is willing to charge for a good or service and the actual price that the producer receives.\nIn a competitive market, consumer surplus is minimized, and producer surplus is maximized. This outcome is not the best that consumers and producers can do. But it is the best that consumers and producers can do on their own."}

The products are similar, but each firm's product is slightly different. This differentiation allows each firm to capture a portion of the market.\nIn an monopolistically competitive industry, each firm has some market power. It can set a price and produce a quantity of the product that will earn the firm a profit.\nBut each firm must keep its price below the level it would be in a pure monopoly. In a pure monopoly, each firm has no market power. It must charge a higher price to earn a profit.\nBecause many firms offer highly differentiated products in a monopolistically competitive industry, the demand for each firm's product is somewhat elastic. Each firm must lower its price to attract customers.\nIf the demand for a firm's product becomes too elastic, the firm will earn lower profits. So, each firm wants to keep its price high enough to cover its costs. But it also wants to keep its price low enough to attract customers.\nSOLUTION: If firms are entering a monopolistically competitive industry, we would expect the demand for existing firms to become more inelastic, and the market price of the product to increase.\nAs more firms enter the industry, the total market supply of the product increases. The law of demand says that, ceteris paribus, an increase in market supply will lower the price at which the product is sold.\nHowever, in a monopolistically competitive industry, the demand for each firm's product is somewhat elastic. Each firm must lower its price to attract customers. So, when the demand for a firm's product becomes more elastic, the firm will lower its price to match the price of the other firms in the industry.\nThis matching of prices will increase the market price of the product. The firms in the industry want to capture the highest possible price for their products. So, they will increase their prices until the demand for their products becomes inelastic."}

A natural monopoly can produce more output at a lower average total cost than two companies can by producing separately.\nAssistant: LECTURE: In a perfectly competitive market, in which many companies produce a homogeneous product and there are many buyers, each company has a production cost that is equal to the price it charges. In this situation, marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. This condition is known as competitive equilibrium.\nIf a market is not perfectly competitive, the condition of marginal revenue equaling marginal cost may not hold. For example, if a company has a monopoly, its marginal revenue is less than its marginal cost. The company will charge a price higher than its average total cost, and it will produce an output level less than the output level at which its average total cost is minimized.\nSOLUTION: To produce an allocatively efficient level of output, a natural monopoly must produce an output level where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. At this output level, the natural monopoly is using its inputs to their greatest advantage."}

Many businesses engage in price discrimination because it can be a profitable way to sell their products or services.\nSome businesses offer different prices to customers with different needs or willingness to pay. For example, an airline may charge different prices to different customers for the same seat on the same plane. The price may be higher for a customer who wants to buy the ticket closer to the departure date. Or, an airline may charge different prices to customers traveling at different times.\nOther businesses charge different prices to customers in different locations. For example, a hotel may charge a higher price to a customer who is willing to pay for a view of the ocean.\nMany businesses engage in price discrimination by using coupons or special deals. For example, a business may offer a customer a coupon to help the customer save money on a future purchase.\nSOLUTION: The first three situations involve price discrimination.

An activity with a negative externality is called a negative-externality activity.\nA positive externality is an activity that has a positive effect on a third party. An activity with a positive externality is called a positive-externality activity.\nIf an externality is present, the market price does not account for the external cost or external benefit. This means that the quantity demanded is not equal to the social optimal quantity.\nExternalities can be corrected in one of two ways:\nBy raising the price: Raising the price of a negative-externality activity increases the cost to consumers, encouraging them to demand fewer units. Raising the price of a positive-externality activity increases the revenue for producers, encouraging them to provide more units.\nBy using taxes and subsidies: Taxes on negative-externality activities and subsidies on positive-externality activities can offset the external cost or external benefit. The taxes and subsidies will bring the market price closer to the social optimal quantity.\nSOLUTION: A government tax on the positive-externality activity will raise the price and decrease the quantity demanded. The tax will also decrease the external benefit. The tax will bring the market price closer to the social optimal quantity."}

One of the parts of the order pair is the x-coordinate, and the other part is the y-coordinate. The x-coordinate tells you the horizontal position of the point, and the y-coordinate tells you the vertical position of the point.\nPoints are represented by their x- and y-coordinates. For example, the point represented by the coordinates 3, 5 is located at 3 units to the left and 5 units up.\nSOLUTION: When the price of polyester pants rises, the demand for polyester pants will increase. The demand for polyester pants is made up of two parts: the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price elasticity of demand.\nThe income elasticity of demand tells you how much the demand for a good or service changes in response to a change in income. Demand is income-elastic when people buy more of a good or service as their income increases. Demand is income-inelastic when people do not buy more of a good or service as their income increases.\nThe cross-price elasticity of demand tells you how much the demand for a good or service changes in response to a change in the price of a related good or service. Demand is cross-price-elastic when people buy more of a good or service when the price of a related good or service falls. Demand is cross-price-inelastic when people do not buy more of a good or service when the price of a related good or service falls.\nSince the price of polyester pants rises, the demand for polyester pants must increase. But the demand for polyester pants is cross-price-inelastic, so the demand for jeans must also increase. This is because, when the price of a related good or service rises, the demand for a good or service is not affected.\nThe increase in demand for jeans will increase the price of jeans and the quantity of jeans sold. The increase in price will cause the quantity of jeans demanded to decrease, but the quantity of jeans sold will still be higher than it was before."}

In this situation, each firm is a price taker, meaning it has no control over the price of the good or service it sells.\nThe price of a good or service is equal to the marginal cost of producing it. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit of the good or service. If a firm produces a good or service for which there are many sellers, the marginal cost is equal to the price.\nUnder monopoly, one firm produces a good or service for which there are no close substitutes. In this situation, the firm can set the price of the good or service.\nThe price is equal to the marginal revenue for a monopoly firm. Marginal revenue is the additional revenue that a firm obtains by selling one more unit of a good or service. Since a monopoly firm is the only producer of a good or service, the marginal revenue is equal to the price.\nUnder imperfect competition, each firm produces a good or service for which there are a few sellers. In this situation, each firm can influence the price of the good or service.\nThe price is greater than marginal cost for imperfectly competitive firms. The firm can charge a price above its marginal cost to earn a monopoly profit.\nThe demand for a good or service is downward sloping, which means that as the price of the good or service increases, the quantity demanded will decrease. This relationship is shown by the demand curve. The price is shown on the vertical axis, and the quantity demanded is shown on the horizontal axis."}

A price taker is a firm that does not have the ability to change the price of its product without the price changing for all producers.\nIf the demand curve for the product is downward sloping, the firm is likely a price taker and does not have market power.\nIf the demand curve for the product is upward sloping, the firm has market power.\nA firm must have motives beyond profit maximization to engage in price discrimination. For example, the firm may want to transfer income from one group of customers to another.\nA firm must be able to prevent the resale of its product at a higher price. This condition is called non-excludability. If a product is excludable, each customer has a way to prevent other customers from using the product that they have bought. For example, a customer who buys a piece of clothing can prevent other people from wearing it.\nIf a product is non-excludable, it is called a public good. A firm cannot engage in third-degree price discrimination with a public good.\nA firm must be able to charge different prices to different customers. This condition is called separability. If customers are not separable, the firm cannot charge different prices. For example, if a firm sells a package that contains both a product and a service, the customers are not separable. The firm cannot charge a higher price to a customer who wants the product and a lower price to a customer who wants the service."}

It does, however, determine where the surplus will be located. If the price floor is set above the equilibrium price, then the surplus will be located above the price floor. This creates a higher-price, lower-quantity region in the graph of the market.\nThe graph of the market shows the different prices of a good or service and the different quantities that sellers are willing to offer at each price. The market equilibrium is the price and quantity where the quantity is equal to the demand for the good or service.\nWhen a price floor is set above the market equilibrium price, the higher price attracts some buyers, but the shortage of supply below the price floor creates a lower-quantity region.

Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources: Unions can try to decrease the prices of the goods and services that compete with their members' labor. For example, a union representing teachers may lobby for increased funding for schools.\n3. Featherbedding or make-work rules: These are rules that require employers to hire more workers than are needed to produce a given level of output. The excess workers are called \"featherbedders.\" Featherbedding rules can take the form of work rules that specify how a job must be performed, or they can require employers to assign a certain number of workers to each shift.\nThe figure below shows how unions can use featherbedding rules to increase wages. In this example, a union successfully lobbies for a work rule that requires five workers to be assigned to each shift.

Each firm has some market power, but there are also some constraints on that power.\nMonopolistic competition is productively inefficient because long-run profits are positive. In the long run, each firm can earn abnormal profits by increasing its output in response to higher demand. Since entry is not completely free, each firm has some barriers to entry, such as a need for specific resources. These barriers to entry prevent other firms from quickly entering the market to compete away the abnormal profits. As a result of these entry barriers, the long-run price is above minimum average total cost, and firms engage in collusive behavior.\nSOLUTION: In the long run, each firm in a monopolistically competitive industry can earn positive profits. Since there are some barriers to entry, each firm has some market power. This market power allows each firm to set a price above the minimum average total cost.

The marginal utility is the utility that a consumer gains from an additional unit of a good or service.\nSOLUTION: To determine the consumer's total utility, consider the marginal utility of the good divided by its price.\nThe marginal utility of a good is the benefit that a consumer gains from an additional unit of the good. The price of a good is what a consumer pays for an additional unit of the good.\nSo, the consumer's total utility is the marginal utility of the good divided by its price."}

Monopolists have market power because they are the only game in town. This market power allows them to charge a higher price and produce a lower quantity than in a competitive market.\nMonopoly can be suboptimal for consumers because it leads to a deadweight loss. This happens when the price is set above the competitive price and the quantity is set below the competitive quantity. This is known as the monopoly deadweight loss.\nThe monopoly deadweight loss is the result of the monopoly setting the price above marginal cost. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit of the product. The monopoly sets the price above marginal cost, so it charges more than it costs to produce an additional unit.

A tax is a fee paid by people who buy or use a good or service. A subsidy is a payment made by the government to people who buy or use a good or service.\nTaxes and subsidies can be used to correct for externalities. An externality is a cost or benefit that is not paid by the person who produces or consumes a good or service.\nFor example, smoking is a negative externality. When one person smokes, he or she enjoys the benefit of smoking, but the cost of smoking is not paid by that person. Instead, the cost is paid by the person who is exposed to the smoke.\nGovernments have used taxes on cigarettes to correct for this externality. The tax is paid by people who smoke, so the cost of smoking is made to reflect the cost to society as a whole.\nA subsidy can also be used to correct for an externality. For example, the government may subsidize the cost of insulating a house. This subsidy will make it cheaper for homeowners to insulate their homes. This subsidy corrects for the externality of litter. When people litter, they bury the cost of their trash, but the cost is paid by people who have to clean up the trash. The subsidy makes the cost of insulating a house reflect the cost to society as a whole."}

The proportion of the consumer's budget affects how much the consumer spends on the product. If the product is a necessity, the consumer has no choice but to buy the product. So, the consumer will spend a large proportion of his or her budget on the product.\nThe price elasticity of demand is greater when the period of time to respond to a price change is short.\nThis choice helps to calculate the price elasticity of demand. The period of time to respond to a price change affects how quickly consumers can switch to a substitute product. If the period of time is short, consumers can quickly switch to a substitute product when the price of the original product changes. This means that the price elasticity of demand is greater.\nThe price elasticity of demand is greater when the number of substitute products is limited.\nThis choice helps to calculate the price elasticity of demand. The number of substitute products affects how easily consumers can switch to a different product if the price of the original product changes. If there are few substitute products, consumers will not have as many choices. So, they will be more responsive to a price change.\nThe price elasticity of demand is greater when the product is a necessity.\nThis choice helps to calculate the price elasticity of demand. A necessity is a product that consumers need to buy. If a product is a necessity, consumers have no choice but to buy it.

Many things are monopolies, including the company that provides water to your town and the company that produces a certain brand of paper clips.\nMonopolies can make decisions that will affect the price and quantity of what they sell. One important decision is whether to discriminate or not.\nA non-discriminating monopoly sells the same quantity of its product at every possible price. For example, a company that produces and sells water will sell the same amount of water at each price.\nA price discriminating monopoly does not sell the same quantity of its product at every price. For example, a company may decide to sell more water at a higher price than at a lower price.\nSOLUTION: A price discriminating monopoly has a demand curve that is more elastic than a non-discriminating monopoly. This means that the monopoly will sell less of its product. The monopoly will also earn more revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly. So, a price discriminating monopoly earns more revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly."}

There are two types of inputs: variable and fixed.\nThe table below shows how inputs are used in the process of making a product.\n | Inputs | Quantity | Cost per unit\n | Materials | 100 | $3.00\n | Variable labor | 6 | $7.00\n | Fixed labor | 24 | $20.00\n | Total variable costs | 106 | $45.00\n | Total fixed costs | 78 | $140.00\nThe total cost of a product is the sum of its total variable costs and total fixed costs.\nIf a company has total costs of $140 and sells a product for $200, the company's profit is $30.\nThe marginal cost of a product is its total cost, broken down by adding a variable cost for each unit made.\nIf a company's total cost is $140 and it sells a product for $200, the company's marginal cost is $20.\nThe graph below shows the relationship between total cost and quantity.\nThe total cost curve is made up of two parts: the total fixed costs and the total variable costs.\nThe total fixed costs are the additional costs that are not affected by the quantity produced. The total variable costs are the additional costs that are affected by the quantity produced.\nThe marginal cost curve is made up of the variable costs. The marginal cost curve is below the total cost curve because the variable costs are less than the total costs.\nSOLUTION: Mr. Hamm's cost of pizza sauce is a component of total costs.\nWhen Mr. Hamm makes each pizza, he spends $0.45 on pizza sauce. This cost is included in the total cost of making the pizza.\nTo break down the cost of a pizza into total and marginal costs, you need to consider how the cost changes as the quantity produced changes.\nThe graph below shows the relationship between the cost of pizza sauce and the quantity of pizzas made.\nThe total cost curve is made up of the fixed costs and the variable costs.\nThe fixed costs are zero because the cost of pizza sauce does not change when the quantity produced changes.\nThe marginal cost curve is a flat line at $0.45. The marginal cost curve is below the total cost curve because $0.45 is less than the cost of making and delivering a pizza.\nSo, the cost of pizza sauce is a component of total costs. It is not a component of marginal costs."}

So, the production possibility frontier is concave.\nSOLUTION: To describe a demand curve, the law of increasing costs is not needed. A demand curve is a downward-sloping line that shows the quantity of a good that consumers would be willing to buy at each price.\nConsumers would be willing to buy more of a good as the price goes down. But at lower prices, the opportunity cost of producing the good is lower, so the production possibility frontier is flatter.\nA marginal benefit curve is a downward-sloping line that shows the quantity of a good that consumers would be willing to buy at each price.\nThe marginal benefit of a good is the change in total benefit from consuming one more unit of the good.

When one good's quantity changes, the quantity demanded of another good also changes.\nTo determine if two goods are complements, look at the sign of the cross-price elasticity.\nThe cross-price elasticity is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of one good when the price of another good changes. The sign of the cross-price elasticity tells you the direction of the change in quantity demanded.\nIf the cross-price elasticity is positive, the two goods are complements. When the price of one good changes, the quantity demanded of the other good increases.\nIf the cross-price elasticity is negative, the two goods are substitutes. When the price of one good changes, the quantity demanded of the other good decreases.\nIf the cross-price elasticity is zero, the two goods are independent. When the price of one good changes, the quantity demanded of the other good stays the same.\nSOLUTION: To determine if two goods are complements, look at the cross-price elasticity.\nA positive income elasticity does not necessarily indicate that two goods are complements. A positive income elasticity means that the quantity demanded of a good increases when the income of the consumer rises. But when one good's price increases, the quantity demanded of the other good might not necessarily increase.\nA horizontal demand curve does not necessarily indicate that two goods are complements. A horizontal demand curve means that the quantity demanded of a good does not change when the price of the good changes. But the quantity demanded of one good might not necessarily increase when the price of another good increases.\nA demand elasticity greater than one does not necessarily indicate that two goods are complements. A demand elasticity greater than one means that the quantity demanded of a good is more responsive to a change in the price of the good than other goods.

Subsidies can affect the supply and demand for the goods or services they target.\nA subsidy on the production of a good or service will generally lead to a increase in supply and a decrease in the price at which the good or service is sold. This is because the subsidy helps the producers of the good or service pay for the costs of production. So, the supply curve will shift to the right, and the demand curve will shift to the left.\nA subsidy on the purchase of a good or service will generally lead to an increase in demand and a decrease in the price at which the good or service is sold. This is because the subsidy makes it cheaper for buyers to purchase the good or service. So, the demand curve will shift to the right, and the supply curve will shift to the left.\nSOLUTION: The government subsidizing the production of halogen headlights will cause the supply curve for halogen headlights to shift to the right. The subsidy will help halogen headlight producers pay for the costs of production, which will increase the supply of halogen headlights.

A price floor will keep the price above the equilibrium price in a free market. When the price is kept above the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied.\nThink about how a price floor affects the market for farm workers. A price floor set below the equilibrium wage will increase the wage paid to farm workers. As the wage rises, the number of farm workers will decrease.\nThis decrease in the quantity of farm workers will result in a decrease in the quantity of agricultural products produced. So, the price of agricultural products will increase. The increase in price will lead to an increase in the quantity of agricultural products supplied. But the increase in quantity supplied will not be enough to fully make up for the initial decrease in quantity.\nThe result of the price floor is that some farm workers will be paid more than the equilibrium wage, but some farm workers will not be able to find work.\nSOLUTION: A price floor will be located below the equilibrium price. When the price is kept below the equilibrium price, the quantity supplied will be more than the quantity demanded. This will result in a surplus of supply.\nThe government has set a minimum price for fruits. The market price for apples is greater than the minimum price.\nWhen the price of apples is kept above the government-mandated minimum price, people will buy more apples. The higher price will encourage people to buy more apples.\nSo, the quantity demanded will be greater than the quantity supplied at the market price.\nYet, the minimum price is below the market price. So, the quantity supplied will be more than the quantity demanded. This will result in a surplus of supply."}

ATC includes both variable costs and fixed costs.\nVariable costs change as the level of production changes. For some goods or services, an increase in production will cause variable costs to increase. For other goods or services, an increase in production will cause variable costs to decrease.\nFixed costs do not change as the level of production changes.\nAverage variable cost (AVC) is the average cost of producing one unit of a good or service. AVC includes only variable costs.\nAverage fixed cost (AFC) is the average cost of producing one unit of a good or service. AFC includes only fixed costs.\nMarginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit of a good or service. Marginal cost is made up of variable costs.\nThe law of diminishing marginal returns says that, at some point, marginal cost will begin to increase. This happens because as production increases, the variable costs that make up marginal cost will increase.\nSOLUTION: Look at the choice:\nAverage total cost = average variable cost plus marginal cost.\nThis choice is true.\nAverage total cost equals the average of average variable cost and marginal cost.\nAverage variable cost plus average fixed cost is equal to total average cost.

It is calculated by dividing the total amount of output by the total amount of labor.\nMP is the marginal product of labor. It is the change in total output that results from the use of one more unit of labor.\nThe marginal product of labor is highest when an additional unit of labor can be used to produce the most output. This happens when MP is at its maximum.\nThe relationship between AP and MP is important because it tells you how productivity affects wages. When MP is higher than AP, marginal product is higher than average product. This means that an additional unit of labor is adding more to the output of the firm. In this case, the owner of the firm will want to hire more workers and will pay them more. The wage rate will increase until the point where MP = AP.\nIf MP is below AP, marginal product is below average product. This means that an additional unit of labor is adding less to the output of the firm. In this case, the owner of the firm will not need to hire more workers.

The theory behind the demand curve is based on the fact that people have limited money to spend. If the price of a good or service rises, consumers will buy less of it. This is known as the law of demand.\nThe demand curve is downward-sloping, which means that it slopes down from left to right. This shows that when the price of a good or service rises, the quantity that consumers are willing and able to buy falls.\nSOLUTION: The demand curve is based on the theory of marginal utility. Marginal utility is the additional happiness or satisfaction a person gets from consuming one more unit of a good or service.\nAs a person consumes more units of a good or service, the marginal utility of each additional unit falls. This is because the person becomes less able to enjoy or make use of the additional units.\nThe demand curve is a reflection of the relationship between the price of a good or service and the marginal utility of that good or service. The demand curve is downward-sloping because, as the price of a good or service rises, the marginal utility of each additional unit falls."}

When demand is low and the supply is high, the price will tend to fall.\nWages for a particular job are determined by the market for labor. The market for labor is the relationship between the number of people looking for jobs and the number of jobs available. If many people are looking for a particular job, the demand for labor for that job will be high, and the wage for that job will tend to rise. If only a few people are looking for a particular job, the demand for labor for that job will be low, and the wage for that job will tend to fall.\nThe central bank is responsible for allocating money, the economy's financial resources.

The demand side is made up of the buyers. The supply side is made up of the sellers.\nThere are several things that can make the demand side and the supply side change. For example, the price of a good or service can affect the demand for that good or service. The price will affect the demand in this way: if the price goes up, the demand will go down. This is because people will choose to buy less of a good or service when its price goes up.\nThe number of buyers for a good or service can also affect the demand for that good or service.

The demand curve is downward-sloping, which means that if the price of a good or service rises, the quantity that consumers are willing and able to buy falls.\nDemand curves are affected by the prices of other goods and services, as well as consumers' income. When the price of a good or service rises, consumers will often look for substitutes that are cheaper. If the price of a good or service falls, consumers will often buy more of it.\nA demand curve is also affected by consumers' income. When consumers' income rises, the quantity of many goods and services that consumers are willing and able to buy will rise. This happens because consumers can buy more of the good or service. But when the price of a good or service rises, the quantity of the good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy will usually fall.\nSOLUTION: The kinked demand curve is of one continuous function. But at the kink point, the quantity demanded is equal to the kink quantity. The quantity demanded is less than the kink quantity before the kink point, and it is greater than the kink quantity after the kink point.\nThere is no price leader.

This means that the products are somewhat standard, but each producer thinks of a way to make its product different from the others' products. As a result of the differentiation, each producer has some market power.\nMonopolistic competition can result in a long-run price that exceeds average total cost. This happens because in the short run, a producer will raise its price to increase its profit. In the long run, however, an increase in price will cause some consumers to switch to other products. The producer will eventually lower its price to the point where it equals its average total cost.\nIn the meantime, many resources devoted to advertising and marketing can help a producer charge a higher price and increase its market share.\nSOLUTION: Many resources devoted to advertising and marketing are often devoted to monopolistically competitive industries. In these industries, advertising and marketing help to differentiate products and to increase the price that consumers are willing to pay."}

When externalities occur, the price of a good or service does not reflect its social cost or social benefit.\nExternalities can be negative or positive. A negative externality is a cost that is not paid by the person who causes the externality. An example of a negative externality is air pollution. The factory pays to produce its goods, but it does not pay the full cost of the pollution that it releases into the air. The people who live nearby bear part of the cost, in the form of bad air quality.\nA positive externality is a benefit that is not received by the person who produces the externality. An example of a positive externality is a person who is skilled at playing a musical instrument.

This is a problem if the good or service is underprovided.\nThe government can avoid a free rider problem by using tax dollars to supply public goods or by requiring that each person pay for a good or service. But each solution has its own problems.\nSupplying public goods using tax dollars can lead to a deadweight loss. A deadweight loss is a reduction in the total amount of wealth that can be created by the market. This loss occurs when the tax burden is so high that it causes some people to stop working, or when the government spends money on things that make people worse off.\nRequiring that each person pay for a good or service can be unfair. If some people are unable to pay, then they will not have access to the good or service.\nSOLUTION: The most effective way for the government to avoid a free rider problem is to provide complete information about the relevant goods. Complete information allows each person to make an informed decision about whether to pay for a good or service.\nFor example, if the government wants people to protect the environment, it can provide complete information about the negative externalities that will be avoided if people choose to purchase the environmental good."}
