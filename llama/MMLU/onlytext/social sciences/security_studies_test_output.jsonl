A liberal perspective on future energy security is one that believes in a free-market approach to energy security, where the market is the primary means of ensuring energy security and governments have a limited role to play.\nSOLUTION: The first statement could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security. It argues that the global economy is interconnected, meaning that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. This interconnectedness makes it unlikely that major powers will compete over energy reserves. The statement also implies that the continued existence of the current economic order depends on maintaining and extending the conditions under which the market operates. This belief in the free market as the primary means of ensuring energy security is a central tenet of liberalism.\nThe second and third statements could be described as conservative perspectives on future energy security. They argue that energy scarcity will lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order' and that energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation, respectively. These statements imply that governments have a larger role to play in ensuring energy security, whether through the creation of a new international energy order or through increased geopolitical confrontation.\nThe fourth statement could be described as a Marxist perspective on future energy security. It argues that energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation, where states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves. This belief in the role of resource scarcity in causing geopolitical conflict is a central tenet of Marxism."}

As a result, earlier works may be more focused and less complex than later works.\nAn example of this evolution can be seen in the work of Donald W. Winnicott, an object relations theorist. Winnicott's early work, such as \"Transitional Objects and Transitional Phenomena\" (1953), focused on the role of security objects in helping individuals manage separation and anxiety. In his later work, such as \"The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment\" (1965), Winnicott discussed how relationships and the environment impact the development of the individual.\nBecause later works in a theorist's oeuvre (complete set of writings) often build on and expand earlier works, it is common to find a range of views within a theory. For example, ego psychology, a later development of psychoanalytic theory, has as its central concern the relationship between the id, ego, and superego. One prominent ego psychologist, Herbert Miles, has written about the importance of the ego for \"mastering the anxieties that arise during early development\" (Miles, 1985, p. 210). Another ego psychologist, Susan Whipp, has explored how ego functions develop in the context of early attachment experiences (Whipp, 1991).\nSOLUTION: The first theory is conventional social constructivism. This view is based on the works of social constructivists who reject positivist methodology.\nThe second theory is critical social constructivism.

This is because states cannot be sure that other states will keep their promises. For example, states may make promises in order to gain an advantage, but then break their promises once they have gained that advantage. This is called the problem of cheating.\nOffensive realism and defensive realism are two variations of realism.\nUnder offensive realism, states seek to achieve security through the acquisition of power. This can be done in one of two ways: by becoming a hegemon, or by becoming a ruthless aggressor. A hegemon is a state that is so powerful that no other state can challenge it. A ruthless aggressor is a state that is willing to use force to achieve its objectives.\nUnder defensive realism, states regard cooperation as the way in which security can be achieved for the state. Defensive realists argue that states cannot trust other states, and that each state must fend for itself in a competitive international system.\nBoth defensive realism and offensive realism regard power and competition as a means by which security can be achieved for the state.\nSOLUTION: Offensive realism defines the international system as an environment in which states seek to achieve security through the acquisition of power.\nDefensive realism regards cooperation as the way in which states can achieve security.\nBoth defensive realism and offensive realism regard power and competition as a means by which security can be achieved for the state."}

Biological sex refers to the physical differences between males and females. Gender roles refer to the expected patterns of behavior that are associated with male and female.\nSOLUTION: The text states that biology determines the female body as weak, ensuring that men continue to dominate state security apparatus in order to protect them. Women are aware of practical biological differences, and by accepting them they allow men to act as their protectors and care-givers. In return, women must act as protectors and care-givers to those less capable than themselves, their children, infants, the elderly, and the infirm.\nThis answer choice suggests that biological differences between men and women affect the roles that men and women must perform.

Biology determines, and woman's intimate choice exerts, that the considerable responsibility of reproducing a state's population becomes the duty of women alone.\nThis answer choice suggests that women are responsible for reproduction, but it is not always the case. Men can also reproduce, and reproduction is not the sole duty of women.\nIndiscriminate warfare is gender neutral and in contemporary conflicts there is no gender difference in levels of risk or duty. Men are just as likely to become victims of mass rape (as in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Balkans conflict) as women, and women are equally likely to be conscripted or coerced into military service.\nThis answer choice states that men and women have equal levels of risk and duty in contemporary warfare.

Weber (1922) argued that modern capitalism was a social order that had emerged from the market, which was a product of the growth of cities and the development of trade. As cities grew, the market became the locus of social interaction, and trade became the dominant form of economic activity. In the market, individuals exchanged goods and services as equals. This was a radical break from the traditional social order, in which lords, knights, and peasants had held specific roles in society.\nWeber also believed that the rise of capitalism had led to the increase of bureaucracy in modern society. Bureaucracies were created to help manage the economy and to conduct the complex transactions that the market required. As bureaucracies grew, they took on a life of their own, becoming more complex and impersonal.\nOther social theorists have built on Weber's work. For example, George Ritzer (2004) has argued that the rise of mega-corporations and globalization has created a form of capitalism called McDonaldization. McDonaldization is characterized by the spread of fast-food restaurants, franchising, and the homogenization of culture.\nScholars have also debated the role of the state in capitalism. On the one hand, some argue that the state plays an important role in creating the conditions for a market to flourish. On the other hand, others argue that the state tends to over-regulate markets, stifling their creativity and innovation.\nAnn Fitz-Gerald (1995) has argued that capitalism has been successful because it is a flexible and dynamic system. Capitalism can adapt to new situations and needs, and it can do so quickly. This flexibility is one of the reasons that capitalism has been able to survive and thrive for so long."}

Theorists see the international system as being constructed through the interactions of individuals and groups, with different constructions leading to different views of the world.\nOne widely articulated criticism of constructivism is that it lacks the ability to empirically prove its theories. Constructivists tend to focus on the ways in which the world is constructed and may overlook the impact of the real world.\nAnother criticism is that the rationalist foundations of constructivism create difficulties in applying its theories within a changing international system. Constructivism shares some roots with rational choice theory, which assumes that actors are rational and make strategic choices. This shared foundation can make it difficult to distinguish between the two theories.\nA related criticism is that, by regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world. In many constructivist theories, the state is the most important actor, and this actor is often defined in nationalist terms. This can make it difficult to theorize about internationalization, or the growing interconnectedness of the world.\nDespite rejecting causality, constructivists simply replace the material trigger of causality with ideas. Some critics claim that constructivism rejects the idea that the world is caused by stable, unchanging factors. Instead, constructivists are said to argue that the world is caused by ideas.

For example, political science includes peace as one of its many subjects, but peace is not the dominant focus of the field.\nThere are many different theories and perspectives within peace research. Some peace researchers examine the structural characteristics of the international system, such as the role of power and wealth in international politics. Other peace researchers study the cultural and social factors that influence international relations, such as national identities and norms. Some peace researchers focus on the role of civil society in affecting the policies of states.\nPeace research is interdisciplinary. Scholars in peace research come from many different fields, including political science, sociology, economics, and psychology."}

It is an extension of the traditional national security focus on military security. Economic security includes the protection of a state's economy from external and internal threats, such as terrorism, economic warfare, and natural disasters.\nEconomic security has several dimensions. One is the economic welfare of the population. A state must ensure that its population has enough food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. If a state cannot provide these necessities, then its people may become vulnerable to alternative economic systems, such as socialism or communism.\nAnother dimension of economic security is the stability of the state's economy. A state must have a stable economy to survive and compete in the world. A stable economy can help a state maintain its military power and provide for the needs of its people.\nA stable economy is based on a country's ability to produce goods and services that it can sell to other countries. The following are the main elements of a stable economy:\nA strong, efficient, and secure business sector.\nA stable, efficient, and secure trade sector.\nA stable, efficient, and secure financial sector.\nA stable, efficient, and secure digital sector.\nMany economic actions can affect a state's economic security. Some of these actions are:\nTrading with other countries.\nInvesting in other countries.\nProviding foreign aid.\nImposing economic sanctions.\nSome of the ways that states can promote economic security are:\nUsing economic intelligence to identify and counter economic threats.\nPromoting economic growth through sound economic policies.\nDiversifying the economy to reduce the risk of economic disruption.\nStrengthening the rule of law to ensure a stable, secure, and predictable environment for business and trade."}

In what follows, we compare some of the major theoretical approaches from the United States and Europe.\nThe United States:\nRealism: The central focus is on the distribution of power and the pursuit of self-help. States are the main actors, and the international system is anarchic. Realists see the international system as a self-help system in which states must make their own security. They focus on military power as the most important source of security.\nLiberalism: The central focus is on the role of international institutions and cooperation. States are the main actors, but international institutions can also be important. The international system is not perfectly anarchic. Liberal theorists see the international system as a cooperative system in which states can choose to cooperate or not. They see trade as a key aspect of cooperation.\nEurope:\nCritical theory: The central focus is on the critique of power and the way that dominant groups can use theory to maintain their power. The international system is not just anarchic but is also a system of hierarchy. Critical theorists see the international system as a system of unequal power in which some states have more power than others.\nConstructivism: The central focus is on the social construction of international politics. States and other actors are not the main actors, but they are important. The international system is not just a system of anarchy or hierarchy but is also a system of multiple, intersecting identities. Constructivists see the international system as a complex, dynamic system in which different identities are constantly constructed and reconstructed.\nSOLUTION: The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.\nIn the United States, theorizing often focuses on the problem-solving tradition. Theorists in this tradition try to identify the best solution to a policy problem. They use rational choice theory and game theory to identify the most effective policy.\nIn Europe, theorizing often focuses on the critical studies tradition.

This belief can be so strong that people are willing to fight and die for it. One way that people preserve their way of life is by instilling their cultural values in the next generation.\nCultural values are ideas that help a society decide what is good and bad, right and wrong, important and unimportant. These values can affect every aspect of a society. For example, cultural values can influence what people believe about the family, what they think is the best way to live, and what things they want to buy.\nTo pass cultural values from one generation to the next, people use institutions. Families, schools, and religious organizations are institutions that can transmit cultural values.\nSecession is a political strategy where a group of people withdraws from a larger group to form a new, smaller group."}

Some technological developments have increased the chances for peace, while others have made conflict more likely. For example, the invention of the printing press increased the spread of information and ideas, which helped to limit the destructiveness of wars. However, the invention of gunpowder and other weapons of mass destruction decreased the chances for peace.\nPeace researchers have identified several ways in which technology can both help and harm peace.\n1. Communication: The spread of information and ideas can help to create common values and reduce misunderstandings among people and nations. Digital media, such as the internet and mobile phones, have greatly increased communication and have the potential to promote peace.\n2. Economic interdependence: The growth of global trade and investment has created a common interest in peace and stability among the international community. This common interest can help to limit the destructiveness of conflicts.\n3. Military technology: The development of deadly weapons and war-fighting technology has increased the destructiveness of wars. For example, the invention of chemical weapons and bombs made from radioactive materials has made wars more deadly and has not been limited to the battlefield.\n4. Political interaction: The growth of international organizations and institutions has increased the opportunities for peaceful resolution of conflicts. For example, the United Nations provides a forum for discussing and resolving conflicts.\nSOLUTION: The second and third choices are both possible implications of recent technological change and development, according to peace studies.\nDigital information, media, and communications technology is likely to inspire greater harmony in the international system as the global population learns more about the world in which they live, and the lives of others around them.\nWith access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution.\nThe first choice is not a valid implication of recent technological change and development, according to peace studies.\nTechnological developments do not affect the majority of the world's population and so the advancement of telecommunications and digital media are not of concern to peace studies.\nThe fourth choice is not a valid implication of recent technological change and development, according to peace studies.\nTechnological change and development is likely to strengthen the power of already dominant international players, and to reinforce the status quo of international relations."}

It is an approach to analysis that focuses on the ways in which social phenomena are created, used, and contested.\nPost-structuralism offers a critique of grand theories and meta-narratives, or global stories that are told about our world. It questions the idea that there is a single, stable reality that can be known or understood from a fixed, God's-eye view. Instead, it emphasizes that the production of knowledge and the use of power are intimately connected.\nPost-structuralist thinkers argue that our understanding of the world is always influenced by the specific social, political, and historical context in which it is produced. They argue that the production of knowledge is always a matter of choosing among many possible combinations of words, ideas, and interpretations.\nPost-structuralism reminds us that the objects of our inquiry, such as security, are not fixed and stable. Rather, these objects are created and re-created over time. It is often the case that the objects of our inquiry are created in such a way as to serve the interests of the powerful.\nA post-structuralist critique of security studies can help to unsettle traditional ways of thinking about security. It can encourage scholars to examine the ways in which their own perspectives and their own lives are implicated in the construction of security.

These perspectives do not represent a single, objective view of security, but rather they help to explain security issues from a particular viewpoint.\nRealism. Realism is one of the dominant perspectives on security. It presumes that states are the most important actors in the international system and that they care primarily about their own security. From this perspective, states are rational and have a strong interest in preventing other states from obtaining weapons of mass destruction.\nInstrumental. The instrumental perspective focuses on how states use force to achieve their goals. This perspective emphasizes that states are not always rational and may use force for irrational or short-sighted reasons. For example, a state may use force to gain territorial or resource benefits, even if it cannot use force to defend itself.\nHuman. The human perspective emphasizes that security is an important need for all people. From this perspective, security is a people's ability to live free from fear. This perspective questions the idea that states are the only actors who care about security.\nPostcolonial. The postcolonial perspective on security focuses on the effects of colonialism on contemporary security issues. This perspective emphasizes that Europe's colonial past has had a lasting impact on the international system. For example, the postcolonial perspective suggests that security is not a European invention, but rather it is a set of practices used by European powers to exercise their dominance over other peoples and parts of the world.\nTraditional. The traditional perspective on security is a narrow view that focuses only on military threats. From this perspective, security is solely a matter of the threats that states pose to each other.\nWomen. The women's perspective on security focuses on the ways that women are affected by and participate in security issues. From this perspective, security is not just a matter of military threats, but also of the threats that women face, such as domestic violence, sexual assault, and other forms of gender-based violence.\nEach of these perspectives on security has a unique focus and a distinctive set of assumptions."}

This lack of government leads to a situation in which states are always potentially in conflict with one another. Realists argue that the following characteristics of the international system increase the likelihood of war:\nThe offence-defence balance in favour of offence: States that can attack their enemies can do so with relative impunity, as their enemies may not be able to attack back effectively.\nA decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack: A state that feels it cannot protect itself from attack will be more motivated to engage in aggressive behavior before it is attacked.\nA multipolar international system: In a system with multiple powerful states, each state has the incentive and opportunity to buckpass, or shift the burden of patrolling and protecting to another state. This can increase the likelihood of war.\nA balance of power that favors offence: In an international system where some states have a mixture of offensive and defensive capabilities, and other states have only defensive capabilities, the latter group will be motivated to arm themselves with offensive capabilities. This can lead to a more competitive environment for states.\nSOLUTION: The first statement is true.\nWhen a state is losing power, it is in a decline in its ability to protect itself from attack. This increase in vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behavior.\nIn a multipolar international system, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass. When one state is trying to attack another state, at least one other state will be motivated to come to the defense of the targeted state. This creates a more competitive environment for states.\nIn a system where the offence-defence balance of the international system favors offence, the offensive powers have more ways to win, and the defensive powers have fewer ways to win. This creates a more competitive environment for states."}

Realists like John Mearshimer argue that international organizations do not make war less likely; they merely give states a veneer of international legitimacy for their aggressive acts.\nLiberalism, or idealism, focuses on the role of international institutions and law in global politics. It sees the world as a system of states that have come together for their mutual benefit. Liberals like Robert Keohane argue that international institutions are the most important determinant of a state's behavior.\nConstructivism focuses on the role of social norms and ideas in international affairs.

However, during the Cold War, the security of states and their military capabilities was called into question. In particular, the possibility of total destruction caused by nuclear weapons raised questions about the usefulness of traditional security approaches.\nHistorians and political scientists began to examine the role of civil society, including women, minorities, and non-state actors, in shaping security. They also analyzed the social, cultural, and political factors that shape the security of states and their citizens. This field of study, which is known as human security, examines the security of individuals and the quality of their lives.\nSOLUTION: HM developed during the Cold War as a response to the limitations of traditional security studies. HM examines the role of civil society and the social, cultural, and political factors that affect the security of states and their citizens.\nDuring the Cold War, HM was not as prominent as it is today. Many security analysts focused on the security concerns of states and their military capabilities.\nHowever, following the Cold War, HM has become one of the main paradigms within security studies.

Once an issue is securitized, it is defined as a security problem, and the response to the issue is framed in terms of military or military-like action. Securitization can lead to a militarized response to an issue, which can cause unintended consequences and missed opportunities.\nFor example, the way the threat of climate change is defined and addressed is shaped by whether it is securitized.

In the realm of international politics, states often use securitization to justify their foreign policies. For example, a state may securitize an issue to explain why it has increased military spending. By securitizing the issue, the state can depict it as a grave threat and justify extreme measures to deal with it.\nSecuritization can be criticized on several grounds.\nA loose and broad conceptualization of security can lead to vagueness and a lack of conceptual and analytical coherence.\nSecuritization theory is often criticized for being too broad and for lacking clear boundaries. This criticism asserts that securitization theory is a catch-all category that can include almost any issue. By being too broad, the theory is too vague to be useful for analyzing world politics.\nThis criticism also argues that securitization theory lacks coherence in terms of its employment as a tool for analytical studies in security. The theory is too open-ended to be a useful framework for analyzing security issues.\nThe model relies on a definition of distinctive political and security realms, which are not always clearly defined.\nCritics argue that securitization theory is based on a definition of security that is not clearly defined. The exact nature of the security realm is often a matter of debate and can be used to justify extreme measures.\nFor example, the exact boundaries of the security realm are not always clear. Is the spread of a disease a security threat? What about an economic crisis? By using securitization to describe a non-security issue, a state can justify taking extreme measures to deal with the issue.\nWhen the securitizing actor is not the state, it can be unclear what would constitute an extraordinary measure.\nThis criticism argues that securitization theory does not clearly define who has the authority to take extraordinary measures in response to a securitized issue. In many cases, the actor who securitizes an issue is not the same as the actor who takes extraordinary measures to deal with the issue.\nFor example, if a company securitizes an issue, who has the authority to take extraordinary measures in response to the issue? The company? The government?\nThe theory of securitization lacks coherence in terms of its employment as a tool for analytical studies in security.\nThis criticism argues that securitization theory is too broad and lacks clear boundaries.

The defense industry also employs large numbers of people to make and maintain these products.\nThe Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States. During the Cold War, these two countries developed large stockpiles of weapons, including chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.\nSince the end of the Cold War, the defense industry has undergone significant changes. One trend is a growing effort by governments to prevent the spread of weapons, especially of WMDs.\nAnother trend is a growth in the volume of the arms trade. In recent years, the global arms trade has grown to include many new players, including countries in Asia and the Middle East.\nA change in the nature of the defense trade, linked to the changing nature of conflict, is another trend. Conflicts today often involve insurgencies and asymmetric warfare, which require different types of weapons and tactics than those used during the Cold War."}

Are they a help or a hindrance?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Diplomacy cannot achieve agreements among small groups of nations where global agreements have failed. Global endorsement is required to legitimize the process, providing greater cooperation, agreements and great power backing.

This is because they have different ideas about what terrorism is and how to prevent it.\nSome governments use terrorism to achieve their goals. These governments see terrorism as a means to gain international attention and influence. For example, some governments have supported terrorist groups as part of their foreign policies.\nOther governments use counterterrorism to achieve their goals. Counterterrorism is the practice of using military and police efforts to stop terrorism. Some governments use counterterrorism to increase their own power. For example, some governments have used counterterrorism to suppress groups that are fighting for independence.\nInternational measures to address terrorism can be hindered by these differences. For example, some countries may not cooperate with other countries in hunting down terrorist groups. This is because these countries have different ideas about what terrorism is and how to prevent it.\nSOLUTION: International measures to address terrorism are a hindrance. There is no international agreement on what terrorism is. Each country has its own definition of terrorism. As a result, countries can use the label \"terrorism\" to describe actions that other countries consider to be legitimate acts of war or political activism.\nThis lack of a universal definition of terrorism makes it difficult for countries to work together to fight terrorism. If countries cannot agree on what terrorism is, then they cannot coordinate their efforts to prevent it."}

The purpose of diplomacy is to negotiate agreements and to resolve conflicts between nations.\nCoercive diplomacy is a form of diplomacy in which one nation uses the threat of military action to pressure another nation to do something. This is different from the use of military action, which is a form of war.\nThere are several types of coercive diplomacy. Economic sanctions involve the government of one nation imposing penalties on another government. Economic sanctions can be used to pressure a government to change its behavior.\nIsolation involves the government of one nation persuading other nations to pressure the target government to change its behavior.\nMediation involves a third nation turning to both the target government and the threatening government in an effort to resolve a conflict.\nThe success of coercive diplomacy depends on several factors.

Energy security is a complex and multifaceted concept. It includes the ability to produce, import, and distribute energy in a cost-effective, efficient, and environmentally sustainable manner.\nThere are several dimensions of energy security.\nThe traditional dimension of energy security involves ensuring the availability of energy supplies. This means having access to enough resources to meet current energy demands.\nThe sustainability dimension of energy security involves making sure that the ways we produce, distribute, and use energy are sustainable. This means ensuring that our use of energy is not harmful to the environment, and that the resources we use for energy are not depleted.\nThe economic dimension of energy security involves ensuring that we have secure access to energy resources that are not controlled by other countries. This means avoiding dependence on energy supplies from areas that may be politically unstable, or that may not share our values.\nThe military dimension of energy security involves using the military to ensure the availability of energy supplies.

They can use the instruments of power to coerce or reward social actors. The four instruments of power are:\n1. Violence: the use of force, including military force and police forces.\n2. Economic incentives: the use of taxation and spending to reward or punish social actors.\n3. Patronage: the use of appointments to high office to reward supporters and help maintain power.\n4. Legitimacy: the belief that the state is right and has the right to govern. When a state is legitimate, social actors are more likely to comply with its policies.\nA state's legitimacy is based on the idea of a social contract.

Security is a central concern for all societies, and it is a field of study that is rich in implications for understanding the past, present, and future of world politics.\nSecurity studies theory is a set of claims about the nature of security and the ways in which states and other actors try to provide for their own security. The following is a list of some of the most important claims made in security studies theory:\nAnarchy: A world without government, law, or any other central authority is a condition of security studies. In such a world, all states and other actors are on their own, and they must provide for their own security.\nSecurity: Security is a central concern for all societies. Security is a state of being free from danger, threat, or harm. Security is often contrasted with insecurity, which is a state of being in danger, at risk, or exposed to harm.\nDeterrence: Deterrence is a strategy that can be used to provide for security. To deter is to persuade someone not to do something. A state can deter another state from attacking it by threatening to attack the attacker in response.\nOffensive realism: Offensive realism is a theory that seeks to explain why states attack other states. According to offensive realism, states attack other states when they calculate that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the costs.\nDefensive realism: Defensive realism is a theory that seeks to explain why states do not attack other states. According to defensive realism, states do not attack other states when they calculate that the benefits of doing so will be outweighed by the costs.\nInstitutions: Institutions are rules and norms that guide the behavior of states and other actors. According to one set of claims, institutions are important for providing security because they help states and other actors to manage conflicts and reduce the likelihood of war.\nIdeational variables: Ideational variables are ideas and values that shape the behavior of states and other actors. According to one set of claims, ideational variables are important for providing security because they help to persuade states to abide by rules and norms.\nPower: Power is the ability to influence the behavior of others. According to one set of claims, power is important for providing security because states with more power are better able to deter other states from attacking them.\nInstruments: Instruments are means to achieve a goal. In the context of security studies, instruments are the ways in which states use power to provide for their own security. Some of the most important instruments of security are military forces, alliances, and diplomacy.\nSecurity is a central concern of every society, and it is a field of study that is rich in implications for understanding the past, present, and future of world politics.\nSOLUTION: Look at the underlined text. This text is about the center of the security studies debate. The security studies debate has been focused on two different but related issues, the distinction between strategic studies and security studies, and the relationship between general International Relations (IR) theory, security studies, and security theory."}

Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Implosion fissure devices are constructed with relative ease because unlike the gun-type fissure device it uses high-explosive shaped lenses to compress the fissile material to critical tolerance. Detonation is highly volatile with a high potential of \"going critical\"."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fissile weapons are produced by the rapid rearrangement of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in a chamber, striking each other at high velocities the friction sparking a chemical explosion."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gun-type devices are of rugged design using two sub-critical masses fired down a barrel at very high velocities with a high probability of producing a reaction. Implosion devices are more complex, requiring the assembling of shaped charges to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances, and are detonated with more than split-second timing."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Nuclear weapons are built with either gun-type or implosion-type fissile material.\nA gun-type fissile weapon is made of two sub-critical masses that are fired at high velocities towards each other. When the two masses collide, they may just barely fuse, or they may not fuse at all. A gun-type weapon is built for reliability. It is a simple design, but it is difficult to make the two sub-critical masses collide with the right timing and the right alignment.\nAn implosion-type fissile weapon uses shaped charges to compress a fissile material to critical tolerances. A shaped charge is a type of explosive that can be shaped to focus the effect of the explosion. By compressing the fissile material to critical tolerances, an implosion-type weapon can cause a greater amount of fusion than a gun-type weapon. An implosion-type weapon is easier to make to use, but it is more difficult to make to build.\nSOLUTION: The first answer choice tells you about gun-type fissure devices. These devices are made of two sub-critical masses that are fired down a barrel at very high velocities.\nThe second answer choice tells you about implosion fissure devices. These devices use high-explosive shaped lenses to compress a fissile material to critical tolerance.\nThe third answer choice tells you about fissile weapons. A fissile weapon is produced by the rapid rearrangement of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen in a chamber.\nThe fourth answer choice tells you about gun-type and implosion-type fissile weapons. Gun-type fissile weapons are made of two sub-critical masses fired down a barrel at very high velocities.

For example, countries may fight over water, oil, or minerals. In addition, pollution can lead to social unrest and even war. For instance, heavy metal pollution of agricultural land has been associated with increased conflict. However, the relationship between environmental change and war is complex. For example, population growth can increase the pressure on the environment, and this can contribute to conflict. But population growth is not the only factor that affects the relationship between environmental change and war. The ways that societies manage their use of natural resources can also contribute to conflict. For example, the way that a country manages its use of oil, gas, or other strategic resources can cause tension among other countries. Overall, the relationship between environmental change and war is complex, and different types of environmental change can have different effects on the likelihood of war.\nSOLUTION: Many strong states have fewer internal violent conflicts than other states. So, for a strong state, environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war. But environmental change can still be a contributing factor to conflict. For example, pollution can lead to social unrest and even war. So, for strong states, the relationship between environmental change and war is likely to be a contributory factor."}

Today, states also join alliances to achieve common goals, such as economic prosperity or military security.\nSOLUTION: A state may decide to join an alliance if it believes that its own resources are inadequate to maintain its sovereignty and security. This choice is based on realist theories of international relations, which hold that states are the primary actors in international relations and that states enter into relationships with other states to protect themselves.\nMore powerful states may also create alliances in order to extend their protective umbrella over weaker friendly states. This choice is based on the theory of social constructivism, which argues that states act in response to their perceptions of the world around them.\nAn alliance can become attractive to states when a potential hegemonic power threatens the other states in that system.

They may have little hope for the future and little stake in the status quo. Such people can become easy recruits for revolutionary movements or terrorist groups.\nThe huge wealth gap between the rich and poor can lead to social unrest and even violence. The rich and the poor often live in completely different worlds, with different concerns and needs. This can lead to resentment and anger on the part of the poor.\nGlobal inequality can also lead to political instability. When people feel that they have no stake in the political system, they may not follow the rules or laws. This can lead to conflict within countries and, in some cases, to international conflict.\nSOLUTION: Global inequality creates disenfranchised populations who, although discontent with their situation, lack the agency to rebel or protest.\nThe choice is based on the idea that many people are disenfranchised\u2014left out of the political and economic systems that affect their lives.

This strategy is more limited and flexible than using force. Coercive diplomacy can be conducted in three stages: preparation, warning, and application.\nThe preparation stage involves planning and readying the coercive measures that will be used in the warning stage.\nThe warning stage involves announcing the coercive measures that will be used if the adversary does not comply.\nThe application stage involves using the coercive measures that were announced in the warning stage.\nThe distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed.
