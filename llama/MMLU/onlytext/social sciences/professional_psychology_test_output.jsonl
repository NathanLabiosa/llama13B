The female reproductive system has organs that include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. The male reproductive system has organs that include the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, and prostate gland.\nIn both men and women, hormones help to control the reproductive system. Hormones are chemicals that are produced by the body.\nThe hormone testosterone is important for male sexual development and function. Testosterone helps to control the development of the testes, penis, and other male sex organs. After a man's testicles form, testosterone helps to control his sex drive, or desire to have sex.\nThe hormone estrogen is important for female sexual development and function. Estrogen helps to control the development of the ovaries, uterus, and other female sex organs. After a woman's ovaries form, estrogen helps to control her sex drive and her response to it.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D. As people age, they may experience significant changes in their sexual function. In men, these changes include a decrease in sexual desire, an increase in the time it takes to achieve an erection, and a decrease in the quality of semen. In women, sexual desire usually stays the same, but sexual response may decrease."}

According to Piaget, children are not born with a complete set of cognitive tools. Instead, they actively construct their understanding of the world around them. This construction is aided by the culture in which the child lives and by the child's experiences.\nPiaget's theory can help us understand how children think and learn. Children are not \"blank slates\" at birth. They do not suddenly acquire a complete set of cognitive tools. This idea is not consistent with Piaget's theory.\nAccording to Piaget, children are \"little scientists.\" Like scientists, children actively explore their world. Today, children learn about magnets by touching, looking, and holding. In the past, children learned about magnets by observing iron nails stick to a magnet. Over time, children's ideas about magnets and iron nails changed as they investigated them.\nPiaget's theory also explains that children are shaped by their culture. Children learn about the world around them by interacting with it. As they interact, children pick up information that is important to their culture. For example, children learn about the importance of time by interacting with the world."}

The therapist aims to clarify and change the dynamics of the family system to help the patient.\nOne of the key assumptions of the structural approach is that every family is a system of interrelated parts. The way family members interact with each other forms a pattern. These patterns can be helpful or harmful to the family.\nWhen a family member has a problem, it is often the case that the problem is maintained or exacerbated by the family's patterns of interaction. For example, a child may become more withdrawn or oppositional as a way to deal with a troubled relationship with a parent.\nThe therapist using the structural approach looks at these patterns and how they contribute to the patient's problems. The therapist then tries to change these patterns to help the patient.\nSOLUTION: A family therapist using the structural approach would most likely issue specific directives designed to counteract dysfunctional processes.\nFor example, if family members are prone to triangulation, the therapist might issue a directive to communicate directly with each other instead of through a third party."}

The following are ways in which a child's environment and experiences can affect behavior:\nThe child's temperament: Some children are born with a fairly sunny disposition, while others are more irritable. Temperament affects how a child behaves in new situations and with new people.\nThe child's intelligence: Intelligence affects how well a child understands the world around them. A child's intelligence may contribute to aggressive behavior if they are frustrated by their failures in school or if they are not able to understand why they should not be aggressive.\nThe child's basic personality: Some children are naturally more outgoing and easygoing, while others are more timid and anxious. A child's basic personality may contribute to aggressive behavior if they are easily annoyed by their siblings or if they are anxious and act out in response to their fears.\nThe strength of the parent-child attachment: Children who have a secure attachment to their parents are more likely to have appropriate behavior than children who are dismissive, anxious, or avoidant.\nThe parents' childrearing behaviors: Parent behaviors, such as the way they discipline their children and the way they react to their children's behaviors, can contribute to aggressive behavior in children.\nSOLUTION: According to Gerald Patterson and his colleagues (1992), the strength of the parent-child attachment is a key contributor to aggressive behavior in children. When children have a secure attachment to their parents, they are more likely to have appropriate behavior than children who are insecurely attached."}

Below are some of the major schools of therapy and their founding theorists.\nPsychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud\nPsychoanalytic therapy is based on the theories of Sigmund Freud. Freud believed that people are born with an inborn desire for pleasure and an instinct to avoid pain. Freud called this the pleasure principle.\nAs people grow and develop, they learn to use their minds to think about situations and to plan their behavior. This thinking and planning is called the reality principle.\nWhen a person's behavior is not reasonable, they may be using the defense mechanism of reaction formation. A person with reaction formation has the opposite feeling or idea to their conscious thoughts.\nLearn more about psychoanalytic therapy.\nBehaviorism: Ivan Pavlov\nBehaviorism is based on the theories of Ivan Pavlov. Pavlov noticed that dogs drool when they smell food. He theorized that this behavior was caused by the dogs' thoughts of food. So, Pavlov believed that all behavior is caused by thoughts.\nThoughts and feelings are not important in behaviorism. Instead, behavior is controlled by the environment. Behaviorists use this knowledge to change people's behavior.\nLearn more about behaviorism.\nCognitive therapy: Aaron T. Beck\nCognitive therapy is based on the theories of Aaron T. Beck. Beck believed that people have bad thoughts, or cognitions, that make them feel bad. Beck thought that by changing these thoughts, people's feelings would get better.\nCognitive therapists help people find and change bad thoughts. They do this by examining patterns of thinking.\nLearn more about cognitive therapy.\nHumanistic therapy: Carl Rogers\nHumanistic therapy is based on the theories of Carl Rogers. Rogers believed that people are born with an inborn desire to grow and learn. This desire is called the actualization tendency.\nRogers thought that people have three basic ways of meeting their actualization tendency. These ways are called the three basic ways of being.\nRogers believed that people can grow and learn by becoming more of the person they want to be. This process is called self-actualization.\nLearn more about humanistic therapy.\nFamily therapy: Virginia Satir\nFamily therapy is based on the theories of Virginia Satir. Satir believed that families have patterns of behavior. These patterns are called family scripts.\nSatir believed that when family members behave in a way that matches a script, the family will experience a sense of chaos. But when family members break the script and behave in a new way, the family will experience a sense of order.\nLearn more about family therapy."}

{"question": "On the basis of his investigation of the relationship between affiliation and anxiety, Schachter concluded that which of the following best accounted for the desire of high-anxiety research participants to wait with other high-anxiety participants?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "demand characteristics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "evaluation apprehension"}, {"label": "C", "text": "relief from discomfort"}, {"label": "D", "text": "social comparison"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: People have a natural desire to affiliate, or connect with, others. Affiliation is the process of seeking out and forming connections with other people.\nWhen a person is in an unfamiliar situation or encounters unfamiliar people, they may experience evaluation apprehension, or the fear of being judged by others. Evaluation apprehension can be a source of anxiety.\nSOLUTION: Schachter's research found that high-anxiety research participants preferred to wait with other high-anxiety participants. This pattern of behavior matched the pattern observed in Schachter's study of the effects of sexual stereotypes on people's preferences for dating partners.\nSocial comparison is the desire to evaluate how much we are liked or respected by others. When people are in an unfamiliar situation, they may choose to affiliate with others who they think are similar to themselves. This is called similarity-attraction.\nThe desire for relief from discomfort is not a good explanation for the desire of high-anxiety research participants to wait with other high-anxiety participants. The high-anxiety participants were with people who were similar in anxiety level. They did not get relief from discomfort.\nDemand characteristics are cues that tell you how to behave in an experiment. They can affect your behavior and the results of the experiment.\nIn Schachter's experiment, the high-anxiety participants had the opportunity to observe and compare their anxiety level with that of other participants. This is an example of demand characteristics."}

One aspect of this design is the need for the random assignment of participants to treatment groups.\nStatistical regression is a potential threat to a study\u2019s internal validity when the researcher is unable to randomly assign participants to the different treatment groups.\nConsider an experiment with three treatment groups and 50 participants in each group. If the researcher is not able to randomly assign participants to the groups, participants in each group may have different pre-existing conditions or abilities. This difference could lead to a false conclusion about the effect of the treatment.\nFor example, consider an experiment to compare the math scores of students who take their classes in person, on line, or by correspondence. If the students are not randomly assigned to these groups, their math scores may be different before the experiment begins. This pre-existing difference could affect the results of the experiment.\nRandom assignment is important because it ensures that each treatment group starts out with the same participants. This way, any differences in the outcome variables can be attributed to the treatment, and not to the pre-existing differences between the groups."}

According to self-perception theory, people can learn about their attitudes and values by observing their behaviors.\nWhen people's behaviors are inconsistent with their attitudes, they experience discomfort or cognitive dissonance. This discomfort can cause people to change their behaviors or their attitudes to reduce the dissonance.\nFor example, if someone claims to value exercise but has not exercised in a week, they might start to feel guilty. This discomfort may cause the person to exercise the next day to reduce their dissonance.\nPeople also tend to attribute their successes to dispositional factors and their failures to situational factors. This is called the self-serving attributional bias.\nFor example, if someone does well on a test, they are more likely to blame their success on their ability. If they do poorly on the test, they are more likely to blame their poor performance on the difficulty of the test."}

It helps keep the system from getting out of balance. In living organisms, for example, negative feedback helps keep the body's processes in balance. For example, when the body has too much sugar in its cells, negative feedback tells the pancreas to release insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin helps move the sugar into the cells where it is used for energy or stored.\nIf the pancreas releases too much insulin, the sugar level in the cells will fall below the normal level. When this happens, the body will begin to have symptoms of low sugar, or hypoglycemia. The body has negative feedback to correct the low sugar level. The feedback tells the pancreas to release more insulin to move sugar into the cells.\nSOLUTION: In a family, negative feedback helps keep the balance between what family members want and need. If a family member wants to make noise after bedtime, negative feedback will tell that family member to be quiet. The feedback will help keep the family member who wants to sleep happy."}

Cooperation can be difficult to achieve, however, because people have conflicting interests. For example, if you are a member of a committee planning a event, you will need to cooperate with the other committee members to plan the event. But as an individual, you may want the event to be a success. How can you decide what to do?\nOne way to decide is to think about the long-term and short-term effects of your choices.\nLong-term effects are the results of a choice that happen over a period of time.\nShort-term effects are the results of a choice that happen quickly.\nSOLUTION: To decrease hostility between groups of junior high school students, you would be best advised to have each group select a representative to discuss ways to reduce hostility.\nThis choice involves short-term effects. It has the students meet and discuss how to get along. This will have an immediate effect on the students' interactions.\nOther choices involve longer-term effects. Increasing opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions may take time to have an effect. A respected member of the community speaking to the students about the benefits of cooperation may have an immediate effect on the students' thoughts, but it does not involve contact with each other. Assigning the students goals that can be achieved only through intergroup cooperation may have a long-term effect on the students' interactions."}

Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature can create a hostile environment, affect the terms and conditions of employment, or interfere with an individual's ability to perform their job.\nQuid pro quo is a type of sexual harassment in which a job developer's response to sexual demands impacts his/her job. For example, if a boss tells an employee that he will only give the employee a promotion if the employee dates him, the boss is engaging in quid pro quo sexual harassment.\nA hostile environment can be created by anyone in the workplace, not just the victim's supervisor. A hostile environment can occur when anyone, such as a supervisor, a co-worker, or a client, makes sexual comments or jokes, shows pornography, or engages in other sexual conduct that is unwelcome.\nSOLUTION: The judgment of a reasonable woman is a type of sexual harassment called quid pro quo.

Reinforcement is what happens after a behavior. It can make the behavior more likely to happen again.\nSome behaviors are reinforced by their consequences. Consequences are what happens as a result of a behavior. Consequences can be reinforcing if they make the behavior more likely to happen again.\nLewinsohn\u2019s behavioral model proposes that depression is caused by a lack of reinforcement from the environment.\nLack of reinforcement means that a behavior is not followed by any consequences that are reinforcing.\nAccidental reinforcement is reinforcement that is not intended to encourage a behavior.\nAccidental reinforcement for depressogenic behaviors is reinforcement that makes depression more likely to occur. For example, withdrawal from social activities may be reinforced by a decrease in anxiety, but this reinforcement can make depression more likely to occur.\nA high need for perfectionism is a behavior that is reinforced by its consequences. A high need for perfectionism is a thinkin that it is important to be perfect. This behavior is reinforced when people succeed. But it is also reinforced when people fail. Failing to meet high standards can be reinforcing. It may make people try harder the next time.\nChronic physical and psychological stress is a behavior that is reinforced by its consequences. Stress can make people more likely to develop depression.\nSOLUTION: According to Lewinsohn\u2019s behavioral model, depression is caused by a lack of reinforcement from the environment. This lack of reinforcement can come from many sources. For example, a lack of reinforcement can occur when people stop doing things that are enjoyable and that they usually do."}

Adolescents can view the world in terms of their own needs and wants. They may believe that the rules of society do not apply to them or that they are invulnerable. This type of thinking can lead to risky behavior such as unprotected sexual intercourse.\nSociocentrism is the ability to view the world from another person's point of view. In early adolescence, individuals begin to develop a social conscience and a sense of right and wrong. They can take the perspective of other people and understand that their thoughts and actions can affect other people.\nIdentity foreclosure is the completion of personality development. During early adolescence, individuals develop a strong sense of self. They know what they believe in and what is important to them. They may reject or \"foreclose\" on other possible identities.\nSOLUTION: The text describes a 15-year-old who is engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse and denying the possibility of pregnancy and/or contracting sexually transmitted diseases.

In order to ensure that the person has given informed consent, psychologists follow a step-by-step process that includes providing information, obtaining consent, and documenting the process.\nThe psychologist discloses information about the assessment, including its purpose, its legal and ethical requirements, and the risks and benefits of the assessment.\nThe person gives consent. The person can give consent by signing a written consent form or by verbally consenting. The person should have a chance to ask questions before giving consent.\nThe psychologist documents the consent process. The psychologist should document the person's consent by having the person sign a consent form or by documenting the person's verbal consent and the information provided.\nSOLUTION: The best way for the psychologist to meet the prescribed ethical responsibility is for the parent(s) to provide written consent and the child to assent verbally to participate in therapy.

This information could affect the stock's price.\nInsider trading is illegal. It is a form of corporate theft that can lead to a company's demise.\nThe illegal nature of insider trading is often debated. The debate usually centers around whether insider trading is a victimless crime.\nSome people believe that insider trading is a victimless crime. They note that insider trading does not involve violence or fraud. They also note that insider trading can help investors. For example, if an insider trader believes that a company's stock is overpriced, he can decide to sell his shares. This decision can help the insider trader avoid a loss. At the same time, the insider trader is able to sell his shares at a higher price than he would have if he had not been given the inside information.\nHowever, insider trading is not a victimless crime. It is a crime for several reasons:\nInsider trading is a form of cheating. When an insider trader uses material information that is not available to the public, he is treating different investors differently. The same rules should apply to all investors.\nInsider trading can distort the market. If some investors have material information that is not available to others, they can make trades that are based on that information. This can cause the market price to be different from what it would be if all investors had access to the same information.\nInsider trading can harm companies. When insiders use material information for their own benefit, they are using the company's information to gain an unfair advantage. This can harm the company and its other shareholders."}

For example, if a projective test shows that you have made responses that indicate you are anxious or depressed, that information can help you understand how you are feeling or how you are coping.\nProjective tests do not measure your intelligence, personality, or any other traits. Instead, they use inkblots, pictures, or other materials to prompt you to reveal your unconscious thoughts or feelings.\nSome projective tests, such as the Rorschach, use ambiguous materials that do not have a right or wrong interpretation. This ambiguity allows the results to be tailored to your personal experiences. For example, your responses to the inkblots in the Rorschach test may reveal information about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This information can be used to help you understand yourself better.\nSOLUTION: The examinee's responses reveal that the examinee has overgeneralized from a part of the inkblot to the whole.

As an infant, the way that you interact with your caregivers helps to form an attachment style. Attachment styles can be organized into four main categories: secure, anxious, avoidant, and disorganized.\nA secure infant forms a relationship with their caregiver, who responds sensitively to the infant's needs. This forms a basis for the infant to explore the world and then return to the caregiver for comfort. As an adult, an individual with a secure attachment style tends to feel comfortable and safe in their relationships with others.\nAn anxious infant becomes attached to their caregiver but is often unsure if their caregiver will respond to their needs. As an adult, an individual with an anxious attachment style may become overly dependent on others to provide comfort and reassurance.\nAn avoidant infant does not form a close relationship with their caregiver. As an adult, an individual with an avoidant attachment style may feel uncomfortable with intimacy and may avoid closeness in their relationships with others.\nA disorganized infant is unable to use their caregiver for comfort and support. As an adult, an individual with a disorganized attachment style may have chaotic or unpredictable relationships with others.\nSOLUTION: This infant demonstrates the ability to become attached to and comforted by their mother.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as if they are the same type.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible types. Each type is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter.\nThe F type is dominant over the f type. This means that the F type version of the gene will produce its version of the trait, while the f type version of the gene will not.\nAn organism has two genes for the flower color trait\u2014one gene inherited from each parent. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of genes for that gene. So, an organism has a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for each gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of gene types. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of gene types.

For example, some families believe that mothers should stay at home with their children, while other families believe that both mothers and fathers should work outside the home.\nSOLUTION: In an immigrant family, serious conflict between the mother and an adolescent child will most likely be due to the adolescent strivings for independence.\nAs children grow, they naturally want to take more control of their lives. This desire for independence can lead to conflicts between parents and children.\nMany immigrant families put their children's needs ahead of their own needs.

The null hypothesis is usually a statement of no difference or no effect. For example, the null hypothesis for a drug study might be that the drug has no effect on the body. The research hypothesis is usually a statement that contrasts with the null hypothesis. For the drug study, the research hypothesis might be that the drug does have an effect on the body.\nTo determine if the research hypothesis is true, the researcher conducts a study and collects data. The data are then used to calculate a test statistic. The test statistic tells you how much the data differ from what would be expected if the null hypothesis were true.\nThe level of significance is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The most common levels of significance are .01 and .05. If the level of significance is .01, the null hypothesis will be rejected for any test statistic that is greater than the critical value. If the level of significance is .05, the null hypothesis will be rejected for any test statistic that is greater than the critical value.\nThe critical value is a value that is greater than or equal to the test statistic. It tells you the lower bound of a range of test statistics that will reject the null hypothesis. The critical value is chosen based on the level of significance and the size of the study.\nIf the test statistic is greater than the critical value, you reject the null hypothesis.\nSOLUTION: The null hypothesis is rejected, but it is true. This means that the researcher has rejected a false null hypothesis. This type of error is called a Type I error."}

These factors can also affect the persuasiveness of the message.\nA communicator's credibility is judged by the receiver based on the communicator's status, the communicator's expertise, and the communicator's trustworthiness.\nStatus refers to the communicator's social standing or reputation. For example, a politician's message is more credible than a ordinary person's message.\nExpertise refers to the communicator's knowledge about the topic of the message. For example, a food scientist's message is more credible than a chef's message.\nTrustworthiness refers to the communicator's honesty and integrity. For example, a dishonest insurance company is less credible than an honest insurance company.\nSOLUTION: The degree to which a receiver's initial position will change is greater when there is a larger discrepancy between the communicator's position and the receiver's initial position. This is because people are more likely to change their beliefs when they are far from their usual position.\nWhen the discrepancy between the communicator's position and the receiver's initial position is smaller, the communicator is not asking the receiver to change as much as the receiver already believes the communicator.\nThe sex of the communicator does not affect the degree to which the receiver's initial position will change."}

Group behavior has an impact on the thoughts, feelings, and actions of individuals, and can be hard to change. Unlike individual behavior, which can be changed by changing an individual's thoughts and feelings, group behavior is often changed by changing the group's norms or expectations.\nNorms are standards that a group uses to evaluate the behavior of its members. Norms can be changed, but they do not have to be. Some norms are formal, meaning that they are explicitly adopted by the group. Other norms are informal, meaning that they are not explicitly discussed by the group.\nExpectations are predictions that a group makes about the behavior of its members. Expectations can be changed, but they do not have to be. Groups often have informal expectations that are not explicitly discussed by the group.\nSOLUTION: Milgram's study of obedience to authority is an example of how norms can change the behavior of individuals in groups. In this study, the participants were put into the role of an authority figure, and they were told to administer electric shocks to another person. The participants did not know that the study was a experiment, and that the person being shocked was a confederate. The confederate was an actor, and he was not really receiving electric shocks.\nThe study showed that when the participants could not see the victim, they were more willing to administer electric shocks. This was because the participants had the informal expectation that the experimenter would not allow the victim to be harmed. When the participants could see the victim, they were more likely to disobey. This was because the participants had the informal expectation that the victim would object to being harmed.\nThis \ufb01nding is predicted by Zimbardo\u2019s notion of pluralistic ignorance. Pluralistic ignorance is the idea that a person may be unaware of the true opinions and behaviors of the people around them. If many people are unaware of the true opinions and behaviors of the people around them, they may have the informal expectation that the people around them believe and do certain things. This informal expectation may cause the person to believe and do those things, even if they do not agree with them."}

The client's profile is created from their assessment results. The job's profile is created from the job's description.\nHere are some common ways to do a profile matching procedure:\n1. Profile similarity index. This method compares the client's and job's profiles to see how much they have in common. The more common elements they have, the more suitable the client is for the job.\n2. Multiple cut-off technique. This method compares the client's and job's profiles to a set of norms. The norms show what is typical for most people. Clients and jobs can be considered similar if their profiles are similar to the norms.\n3. Profile coding method. This method places clients and jobs into categories based on their profiles. The categories can be used to match clients to jobs.\n4. Test-by-test matching procedure. This method compares the client's and job's scores on each aptitude test. The client and job are considered similar if they have similar scores on the same aptitude tests."}

Dual relationships occur when a psychologist has more than one role with a client. For example, a psychologist may have a dual relationship with a client when the psychologist is also the client's teacher, employer, or supervisor.\nDual relationships can lead to conflicts of interest. For example, a psychologist who is a teacher to a client may feel pressured to give a client a passing grade, even if the client is struggling in the class.\nA conflict of interest can occur when a psychologist has multiple roles that could potentially conflict with each other. For example, a psychologist may have a conflict of interest when the psychologist is responsible for assessing a client and making recommendations to the client's employer.\nPsychologists are required to avoid dual relationships and conflicts of interest. If a dual relationship cannot be avoided, psychologists must take steps to manage the potential conflicts. For example, a psychologist who is in a dual relationship with a client must document the dual relationship in the client's file and ensure that the psychologist with the conflict of interest is not the primary provider for the client.\nIf a psychologist acts as both a fact witness for the plaintiff and an expert witness for the court in a criminal trial, the psychologist has acted unethically by accepting dual roles."}

It is designed to help patients find the motivation to make positive changes in their lives.\nDuring a counseling session, patients may experience some ambivalence about making a change. Ambivalence means having mixed feelings about something. For example, a patient may want to lose weight, but may also enjoy eating rich foods.\nMotivational Interviewing is based on the idea that patients are more likely to make changes when they find the motivation to do so. The counselor's role is to help the patient explore the ambivalence and find the motivation to make a change.\nThere are four processes of Motivational Interviewing:\n1. Engage: The counselor begins the counseling session by building a rapport with the patient. This makes the patient feel more comfortable and open to discussing the problem.\n2. Explore: The counselor helps the patient explore the ambivalence about the problem. This involves helping the patient look at the positive and negative aspects of the problem.\n3. Develop discrepancies: The counselor helps the patient see the discrepancies, or differences, between the patient's values and the problem behavior. This can help the patient find the motivation to change.\n4. Work on a change: The counselor helps the patient decide to work on a change. This involves setting goals and making a plan to achieve them."}

Some unconscious material bubbles up into the preconscious and can become conscious.\nDefense is an unconscious process that keeps threatening thoughts, feelings, and memories out of consciousness. There are many types of defense mechanisms, or ways to protect the psyche from threatening material.\nAnxiety is the emotional response to threat. Anxiety is caused by the release of stress hormones, such as adrenaline.\nWhen a person is threatened, the body's defenses kick in. The body's defenses, or coping strategies, can be conscious or unconscious.\nConscious defenses include things like avoiding the threat, confronting the threat, or changing the way a person thinks about the threat.\nUnconscious defenses include things like repression, denial, and displacement.\nRepression is the most common unconscious defense mechanism. Repression involves pushing threatening thoughts and feelings out of consciousness.\nDenial is a defense mechanism in which a person refuses to acknowledge a threatening situation.\nDisplacement is a defense mechanism in which a person redirects feelings from an inaccessible target to an accessible target.\nSOLUTION: A maladaptive behavior that emerges as a compromise between an unconscious impulse and the resulting defense process is called a symptom."}

Children then begin to develop a sense of self that is either consistent or inconsistent with their gender. Children who are consistent with their gender have a healthy gender identity, while children who are inconsistent with their gender have a poor gender identity.\nAccording to the social learning theory of gender-role identity development, children learn their gender roles from their parents and society. This learning process is influenced by the social context in which the child lives. Children then use their learned gender role to guide their behavior.\nAccording to the cognitive development theory of gender-role identity development, children form their gender identity as they interact with their environment. Children understand that males and females are different and develop a gender identity based on these differences.\nAccording to the gender schema theory of gender-role identity development, children are not born with a specific understanding of gender. Instead, children learn to categorize things and people as male or female. Children then use these categories to make predictions about how males and females should behave.\nSOLUTION: The psychodynamic theory of gender-role identity development is the most consistent with the research described in the question.

Reliability is the extent to which a measurement tool produces the same results on multiple occasions.\nThere are two types of reliability:\nInternal consistency reliability: This type of reliability is used when you are measuring a trait in which each item is related to the same aspect of the trait. Internal consistency reliability can be calculated by dividing the number of items that test the same trait by the number of items that test other traits. The resulting value is then multiplied by 100.\nFor example, if 12 of 15 items test one aspect of a trait and three items test a different aspect of the trait, the internal consistency reliability is 12/15 = 0.8.\nTest-retest reliability reliability: This type of reliability is used when you are measuring a trait that can be measured over time. Test-retest reliability can be calculated by comparing scores on one administration of the measurement tool to scores on a different administration of the tool. The two administrations should be separated by a long enough period of time that the subject's score on the first administration is unlikely to affect their score on the second administration.\nFor example, if a measurement tool is administered to a group of subjects and then administered again one month later, the test-retest reliability reliability is 1.0.\nSOLUTION: The best example of constant error is a subject who consistently provides wrong answers to every test item. This subject's answers do not change, no matter what the questions are.\nThe other three choices describe situations in which a measurement tool is not producing consistent results.\nA psychometrician who consistently underestimates IQ scores by 10 points is not producing consistent results. A psychometrician is a person who creates and scores measurement tools.\nA test item is answered incorrectly by every student in a given class is a result, not a constant error. A result is what you find when you use a measurement tool.\nA test-retest reliability coefficient is low for several samples is a result. A low test-retest reliability coefficient means that a measurement tool is not consistent."}

The primary goal of exposure therapy is to help the person face and cope with the things that cause anxiety.\nGraded exposure is a type of exposure therapy in which the person is gradually exposed to the thing that causes anxiety. The exposure starts with mild situations that make the person anxious and ends with more severe situations. This type of exposure therapy is based on the principle that anxiety will decrease as a person becomes more comfortable with a situation that causes anxiety.\nModeling is a type of exposure therapy in which the person observes a person they admire coping with the thing that causes anxiety. The person who is admired may be a therapist, a family member, or a friend. The person who is observing can learn new ways of coping by watching the person they admire.\nReinforced practice is a type of exposure therapy in which the person practices a new behavior while receiving reinforcement. Reinforcement is something that is given after the behavior occurs. The reinforcement is used to strengthen the behavior. The new behavior is chosen because it can help the person cope with the thing that causes anxiety.\nImplosion is a type of exposure therapy in which the person deliberately confronts the thing that causes anxiety in order to intently focus on the anxiety-causing stimulus. The person's goal is to learn more about the anxiety-causing stimulus and to change their behavior in response to the stimulus.\nSOLUTION: The program of treatment described in the question relies on graduated exposure to traveling by bus, with actual real-life behavioral activities increased across trials.

Behaviors that are acquired during maturation do not need to be learned.\n2. Imprinting: Some behaviors, such as a bird finding food, are acquired by imprinting. Imprinting does not require the use of the senses. Imprinting can occur immediately after birth.\n3. Habituation: Some behaviors, such as a person turning down the volume on a radio, are acquired by habituation. Habituation is the result of the environment. Animals habituate to their environment when they spend time in an area with stable stimuli.\nSOLUTION: An animal's behavior is imprinted during a critical period.

How might you decide what to do with the information you gather?\nOne approach is to use deception. For example, you might claim that your product is environmentally friendlier than it really is. Then, you can see how willing people are to pay more for the product, based on their belief that it is environmentally friendly.\nThis approach may work, but it can also be ethically questionable. Deception can harm people's trust in scientists and researchers. And, deception can lead to research results that are misleading."}

A meta-analysis can be conducted when there are multiple studies on a topic.\nA meta-analysis has several benefits. It can increase statistical power, improve the accuracy of estimates, and help to identify sources of disagreement among the studies.\nA meta-analysis is different from a literature review. A literature review is a narrative article that summarizes the results and conclusions of previous studies. A meta-analysis is a quantitative study that uses statistical methods to combine the results of previous studies.\nTo conduct a meta-analysis, you must identify the studies to be included in the analysis. This process is called sample selection. You must have a clear set of criteria to identify the studies that are included in the meta-analysis.\nThe next step is to collect the data from the studies that you have identified. This process is called data extraction. You will need to extract the relevant data from each study and enter it into a computer.\nNext, you will need to transform the data into a form that can be analyzed. This process is called data transformation. For example, you might calculate a mean score for each study.\nOnce the data are transformed, you can analyze them. You can use a variety of statistical methods to analyze the data. For example, you might use correlation or regression techniques to determine how two variables are related.\nFinally, you can report the results of the meta-analysis. A meta-analysis should report the results in a clear, concise manner. You should report the effect size, the precision of the estimate, and the statistical significance of the result."}

Random assignment helps to make sure that each group in an experiment is similar to every other group.\nRandom selection is used to choose groups for the experiment. If each group is chosen at random, then each group will be similar to every other group.\nConsider an experiment with three possible groups: a control group, a medical treatment group, and a placebo group. A random assignment will make sure that each group is made up of people who are similar to each other.

This is done by assuming that the scores for each group of subjects were equal before the experiment was begun.\nFor example, if two groups of students received different teaching methods for a lesson, and then were tested on their knowledge of the lesson, an ANCOVA can be used to determine if one teaching method had a different MEAN success rate than the other teaching method.\nIn this case, the IV is the teaching method. The DV is the success rate. The EV is the type of students in the classes.\nThe subjects in each group were equal before the experiment was begun, but they were not all the same. So, we need to use ANCOVA instead of a regular ANOVA.\nSOLUTION: The third answer choice is the correct answer.\nThe ANCOVA form is used when all subjects receive all levels of the IV."}

These cognitive abilities include ways of thinking that help children understand the world around them.\nSOLUTION: Piaget's theory of cognitive development describes how children's thinking changes as they grow. There are four main stages of development.\nSensorimotor stage: In this stage, which covers birth to 2 years of age, children learn to interact with the world around them. Children learn to use language, solve problems, and use tools.\nPreoperational stage: In this stage, which covers ages 2 to 7 years, children learn to use language to represent the world. Children can use symbols to represent objects and can imagine several ways to solve a problem.\nConcrete operational stage: In this stage, which covers ages 7 to 12 years, children learn to think in a more logical way. Children can think about objects and ideas that are not present. They can also think about several steps in a process and plan ahead.\nFormal operational stage: In this stage, which covers ages 12 to 18 years and beyond, children can think abstractly and logically. They can think about abstract concepts and ideas, such as justice and equality.\nAccording to Piaget's theory, children's reasoning skills are best suited to which stage?\nHypothetical-deductive reasoning is the way adults and teenagers think. This way of thinking involves creating a hypothesis and then testing it with information.\nEgocentrism is a way of thinking that is typical of young children. Children under age 7 often believe that their thoughts and feelings are the same as those of others.\nCentering is a way of thinking that is typical of young children. Children under age 7 often believe that the world works in a fixed way, and they find it hard to imagine things happening differently.\nObject permanence is a developmental skill that children learn. By 7 months of age, most children understand that objects continue to exist even when they can no longer see them."}

These two capacities arise from the interplay of two innate drives: the drive for attachment and the drive for independence.\nMargaret Mahler proposed that the development of a sense of self is related to the achievement of pseudomutuality. She defined pseudomutuality as the child's evolving ability to communicate with others in a mutual way. According to Mahler, the child's progress from symbiosis to pseudomutuality to genuine mutuality contributes to the development of a sense of self.\nSymbiosis: The child's inability to distinguish self from other.\nSOLUTION: In pseudomutuality, the child communicates with others in a mutual way, but the interaction is still asymmetrical. The child is not yet able to shake off the drive to be the center of the world, but the child is able to understand that others are separate individuals.\nMahler described the development of pseudomutuality as a child's progress from a horizontal or parallel self to an vertical or differentiation self. The horizontal self is characterized by the inability to differentiate self from other. The vertical self is characterized by the ability to be separate and to relate to others."}

When meta-analysis is used to examine the relationship between marital discord and child behavior problems, it looks at the research on the topic in order to determine if there is a significant relationship.\nMeta-analysis shows that there is a significant relationship between marital discord and child behavior problems. When marital discord occurs, children can manifest behavior problems. The table below shows the effect sizes that have been found in this research. An effect size tells you the magnitude of the relationship.\n | Type of marital discord | Effect size\nEmotional discord | .20\nPhysical discord | .22\nSOLUTION: The table shows that both emotional discord and physical discord are significantly related to child behavior problems. However, emotional discord is more strongly related to child behavior problems than physical discord.\nSo, the girl is more likely than the boy to manifest an immediate behavior problem. The effect size for emotional discord is .20, and the boy is a girl."}

It is the process by which a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, eventually coming to elicit a response on its own.\nFor example, imagine that you hear a bell every time someone comes to your door. After a while, the sound of the bell alone may make you aware that someone is at the door. The bell is now associated with the person entering the house. This association has caused the bell to become a conditioned stimulus for the conditioned response of going to the door.\nSOLUTION: Anxiety induced by reading about an automobile accident some months after having had such an accident is an example of mediated generalization. This type of learning occurs when a person learns to associate a conditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus.\nThe accident that you had was a conditioned stimulus. The mediated generalization was the result of reading about an accident that was similar to your own. The reading material is a neutral stimulus."}

One way to do this is to study the basic needs of organisms and how they satisfy those needs.\nAnimals have both internal and external environments.\nThe internal environment is made up of the cells and organs that keep the animal's body functioning.\nThe external environment is everything outside the animal's body.\nAn animal's behavior is shaped by its attempt to satisfy its basic needs in both the internal and external environments.\nAn animal's basic needs include food, water, shelter, and air. Animals need food and water for energy. They need shelter to protect them from the elements. Animals need air to breathe.\nSOLUTION: Attachment is how animals form relationships with other animals.\nHumans and animals have a basic need for attachment. They need to form relationships with other animals in order to survive.\nAttachment helps animals meet their basic needs for food, water, shelter, and air. For example, parents can help their offspring by finding food and protecting them from harm. Offspring can help their parents by finding food and spreading their offspring."}

In our interactions with others, we are both actors and observers. As actors, we use our own motives and abilities to select behaviors that will help us achieve our goals. As observers, we judge other people's behaviors and try to understand what is motivating them.\nSocial psychologists use a three-part model to describe the different components of social behavior. The three parts are:\n1. The actor: This is the part of a person that decides on a specific behavior or choice. The actor's choices are based on the actor's motives, goals, and attitudes.\n2. The situation: This is the part of social behavior that includes the social context in which the behavior occurs. The situation includes the social context, the other people involved, and the norms of the social context.\n3. The response: This is the outcome of a behavior or choice. The response is influenced by the actor's choices and by the situation.\nSocial psychologists call the interaction of the actor, situation, and response the three-part model of social behavior. This model can help you understand the many different factors that can influence a person's behavior.\nSOLUTION: A person who is low in self-monitoring will rely on his or her own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs when deciding how to act in a particular social situation. This person will use his or her internal working models, which were acquired during infancy and early childhood.\nA person who is high in self-monitoring will rely on the emotional reactions and behaviors of the people he or she is interacting with when deciding how to act in a particular social situation.

These ideals guide the development of either a healthy sense of self or a sense of shame and doubt.\nBasic trust vs. mistrust: In the first stage of psychosocial development, an infant's world is centered on the relationship between himself or herself and his or her primary caregiver. During this stage, the infant will either develop basic trust, or he or she will learn to mistrust the world.\nAutonomy vs. shame and doubt: As an infant begins to walk and explore the world, he or she must learn to control the body. During this stage, the infant will either develop a sense of autonomy, or he or she will develop shame and doubt about the body's abilities.\nInitiative vs. guilt: As an infant begins to assert their will and test their limits, they must learn to control their impulses. During this stage, the infant will either develop a sense of initiative, or he or she will develop guilty feelings about his or her actions.\nIndustry vs. inferiority: As a child passes through the stages of psychosocial development, he or she will develop a sense of industry, or a sense of inferiority. A child with a sense of industry will learn to enjoy work and to develop a sense of purpose. A child with a sense of inferiority will feel inadequate and will be unable to develop a sense of purpose.\nInitiative vs. guilt: This stage corresponds to Freud's phallic stage. During this stage, a child begins to feel shame about his or her body and may feel guilty about his or her actions. The child may also begin to feel a sense of independence and initiative."}

According to Freud's theory of psychoanalysis, dreams are expressions of unconscious thoughts and feelings that a person is not aware of. Dreams can be used to uncover patterns of thought and behavior that may be damaging to a person's well-being.\nFreud's notion of psychic determinism means that unconscious thoughts and feelings have a powerful influence on a person's behavior. According to Freud, many of a person's behaviors are pre-determined by unconscious factors, and these behaviors can be understood by analyzing a person's dreams.\nFreud's notion of reciprocal determinism means that conscious and unconscious thoughts and feelings interact and mutually influence each other. According to Freud, a person's conscious thoughts and feelings are influenced by unconscious factors, and a person's unconscious thoughts and feelings are influenced by conscious experiences.\nFreud's notion of ptyalism means that the teeth and the mouth have a special significance in dreams. According to Freud, the mouth represents a person's ability to communicate, and the teeth represent a person's ability to negotiate the world."}

We use it to bring to mind facts and events that we have learned.\nImplicit memory is unconscious and nonintentional. We use it to carry out skills and habits that we have learned.\nBoth forms of memory can occur without our awareness.\nAnimals have a similar two-part memory system. In animals, explicit memory is called \"declarative\" memory, and implicit memory is called \"procedural\" memory.\nSOLUTION: Research on adult life span and memory shows that both forms of memory change with age. The degree to which each form of memory changes, however, is different.\nImplicit memory capacity declines with age. Older adults are less able to pick up new habits or skills. But they can still perform familiar habits.\nExplicit memory capacity declines with age, but it remains more stable than implicit memory. Older adults have more trouble bringing to mind facts and events from the past.\nBoth forms of memory can decline when they are affected by a disease. For example, both explicit and implicit memory decline in people with Alzheimer's disease."}

This can happen when the scattering of the data increases as the predictor variable changes.\nHeteroscedasticity can cause errors in predictions. For example, consider the straight line that has the same slope as the regression line for a homoscedastic data set. Circles represent individual data points.\nIf the data are heteroscedastic, the scattering of the data increases as the predictor variable changes. As a result, the lines represented by the circles do not have the same slope as the regression line. This means that the lines do not all pass through the same point. This error in prediction can make it appear that the predictor has a relationship with the criterion that is not actually there.\nSOLUTION: To determine if the relationship between the predictor and criterion can be described by a straight line, look at the scattergram to see if it is homoscedastic.\nIf the variability of the scores on the criterion is the same for different scores on the predictor, the scattergram is homoscedastic.\nIf the variability of the scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor, the scattergram is heteroscedastic.\nIf the predictor and criterion are plotted on a common set of axes, a line can be drawn that describes the relationship between the predictor and criterion.\nIf one or both of the sets of scores are restricted to a range, or if the predictor and criterion are not plotted on a common set of axes, the relationship between the predictor and criterion cannot be described by a straight line."}

The use of animals in research has been criticized by some individuals who believe that it is cruel and unnecessary. However, scientists have used animals to study human behavior for many years.\nAnimal research has led to many important discoveries, and it continues to be a vital tool in understanding human behavior. Animal research is needed to understand the complex workings of the human brain and to develop new treatments for psychological and medical disorders.\nThe use of animals in research is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Institutes of Health, and the Association for Assistant Administrators of the USDA. These organizations have established specific guidelines to ensure that animals are treated humanely and that scientists use animals in an ethical and responsible manner.\nSOLUTION: The best description of a researcher's obligations regarding the use of animals in psychological research is that inflicting pain or stress on animals is acceptable in research as long as it is minimized and the animal's life is terminated as soon as is feasible.

When designing an experiment, you must identify the parts of the experiment that are important to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.\nImagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what to test and what to measure during your experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must test different types of soil.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick."}
