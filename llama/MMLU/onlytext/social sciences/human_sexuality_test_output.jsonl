We assign gender to people based on their biological sex and the social and cultural roles that go with it.\nA person's biological sex is assigned at birth by looking at their anatomy. A person's biological sex can be male, female, or intersex. Intersex is a variation in a person's anatomy and genetics that does not fit the typical definitions of male or female.\nGender is performed by people. The social and cultural roles that go with a gender are learned. Some of the things that can vary between different gender groups are:\nThe types of clothing people choose to wear.\nThe activities they enjoy.\nThe ways they behave.\nThe roles they choose to play in relationships.\nSOLUTION: Children do not choose their gender. Children learn the social and cultural roles that go with their gender. Boys and girls are expected to learn different types of behavior. These expectations are called gender roles.\nBruce and Chuck were expected to learn different types of behavior because they are different genders. A boy is expected to participate in male-typical play. Male-typical play includes playing with trucks and action figures. A girl is expected to participate in female-typical play. Female-typical play includes playing with dolls.\nBruce likely participated in more male-typical play than Chuck.

Social learning theory applies to a wide range of behaviors, including riding a bicycle, driving a car, and interpersonal behaviors such as talking or fighting.\nAccording to social learning theory, young children learn by observing the people around them. As children watch and imitate their models, they learn to repeat the behaviors that their models perform. People are also influenced by the rewards and punishments that follow their behaviors. So, social learning theory explains how people learn by observing others and by experiencing the consequences of their behaviors."}

When you drink alcohol, the alcohol affects the communication between neurons in the brain.\nNormally, neurons in the brain communicate by sending messages across small gaps, called synapses. Neurotransmitters are the chemicals that neurons use to send these messages. When a neuron sends a message to another neuron, the neurotransmitter is released and fits into special proteins on the nearby neuron. This fitting of the neurotransmitter into the protein receptor causes an electrical signal to be sent to the nearby neuron.\nThe illustration shows how alcohol affects the communication between neurons. When you drink alcohol, the alcohol fits into neurotransmitter receptors on the neurons. This fits of the alcohol into the receptors changes the brain's chemistry, which in turn affects the normal activity of the brain.\nThe exact changes in the brain's chemistry depend on the amount of alcohol that is consumed. The effects of alcohol on the brain can include:\nA decrease in the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This decrease can lead to an increase in arousal and an decrease in the sensation of pain.\nA decrease in the activity of glutamate. This decrease can affect the parts of the brain that are involved in forming memories and controlling movement.\nAn increase in the activity of dopamine. This increase can lead to an increase in pleasure and a decrease in the perception of pain.\nAn increase in the activity of serotonin. This increase can lead to an increase in feelings of well-being and happiness.\nThe effects of alcohol on the body are different. Alcohol is a depressant, but it can initially cause an increase in arousal. This increase is called a stimulation period. The stimulation period can last from a few minutes to several hours.\nAfter the stimulation period is over, the effects of alcohol on the body can include:\nA decrease in sensation. This decrease can affect touch, taste, and vision.\nSlowed breathing and heart rate.\nSOLUTION: If Stan consumes less alcohol, the alcohol will affect the brain less. The inhibition of the brain will decrease."}

The penis has two types of tissue. The corpora cavernosa is made up of spongy tissue. The corpus spongiosum is the bottom layer of the penis.\nWhen a man becomes sexually excited, the blood vessels in the corpora cavernosa widen. This allows more blood to flow into the spongy tissue.

These limitations may have introduced bias into the study, or the study may not have been large enough to detect a statistically significant effect.\nPlausible criticisms can help you evaluate a study's claims. If a study has plausible criticisms, you can be more cautious in interpreting the results.\nA study with no plausible criticisms has no major limitations that affected the results. This does not mean that the study is perfect, but that the results are strong and are less likely to be affected by limitations.\nSOLUTION: The study had several plausible criticisms.\nFirst, the gay and straight groups were not equivalent in terms of the number of deaths due to AIDS. This may have affected the results.\nSecond, lesbians were omitted from the study. This means that the study did not investigate the specific issues for lesbians.\nThird, the sample size was relatively small. A smaller sample size may have affected the study's ability to detect a difference, if that difference is small."}

The endocrine system is made up of glands that produce hormones.\nHormones are released into the bloodstream near the gland where they are produced. The blood carries the hormones to the cells in the body.\nCells have hormone receptors on their surface. Hormone receptors are like tinylocks. The hormones attach to the locks. This binds the hormone to the cell.\nThe cell's surface is now covered in hormone. The cell can now be signaled to begin producing chemicals or to begin acting in a certain way.\nSOLUTION: Hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream."}
{"question": "By 28 days after conception, the embryo is about __________ centimetres long.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nImagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?\nThe number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.\nNow look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.\nThere are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.\nThere are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.\nSOLUTION: You are given a picture of a embryo that is 28 days old. The embryo is about 3 centimeters long.\nThe picture tells you that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the embryo is 3 centimeters."}

When a man becomes sexually aroused, blood flow to his penis increases. This increased blood flow causes the penis to expand and stiffen. The erection occurs because the penis is filled with more blood than usual.\nVasocongestion is the result of increased blood flow. When blood flow decreases, the penis becomes less stiff. This is called detumescence.\nSOLUTION: Anxiety can cause detumescence. When a man is anxious, his body produces stress hormones. These hormones can cause the penis to become less stiff."}

These structures include the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and urethra.\nSOLUTION: The refractory period occurs in males during the plateau stage.\nDuring the plateau stage, the body experiences an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension. This increase happens in response to the build-up of sexual tension.\nThe refractory period is the time it takes for a male's body to recovery from the refractory stage. During the refractory period, a male cannot produce or release sperm."}

It is rich in glycoproteins and is exposed on the surface of the egg after assembly of the germ plasm. The matrix binds to the plasma membrane and is removed when the egg dissolves after fertilization.\nThe zona pellucida plays multiple roles in fertilization. It prevents polyspermy, or the fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm. It also helps to attract sperm to the egg and to anchor the fertilized egg to the uterus.\nSOLUTION: The zona pellucida is a protective layer surrounding the egg."}
