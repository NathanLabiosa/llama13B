When a country raises a tariff, the price of the imported product will increase. This makes the product more expensive for consumers and less competitive than similar products made domestically.\nA quota is a limit on the amount of a product that can be imported. When a country imposes a quota, the price of the imported product will usually increase. This happens because fewer products are available on the market, so the remaining products are more expensive.\nSOLUTION: Tariffs and quotas are both ways to restrict trade. Like a tax, a tariff raises the price of imported products. Like a limit, a quota limits the amount of imported products.\nSo, tariffs and quotas can both raise the amount of the product sold domestically. This happens because consumers will pay more for the product, or there will be fewer products to compete with domestically sold products."}

The debt securities are instruments that raise money for companies and governments.\nWhen investors buy a government bond, they are lending money to the government. In exchange, the government promises to pay the investor interest and to repay the principal amount of the loan when the bond matures.\nThe prices of bonds move in the opposite direction of interest rates. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. And when interest rates fall, bond prices rise.\nThe yield of a bond is equal to the interest rate. So, when the yield of a bond rises, the interest rate has risen. And when the yield of a bond falls, the interest rate has fallen.\nSOLUTION: A likely cause of falling Treasury bond prices might be an expansionary monetary policy. An expansionary monetary policy is a policy of adding more money to the economy. When the supply of money increases, interest rates tend to rise.\nBond prices fell, and interest rates rose, during the 1970s. The Federal Reserve had been expanding the money supply to cope with high inflation. When the Federal Reserve stops expanding the money supply, interest rates tend to fall."}

This point is called the equilibrium level of production.\nThe graph below shows how the equilibrium level of production may be reached. The curve that shows the current short-run trade-off between GDP and the price level is downward-sloping. This means that, in the short run, the price level is lower when GDP is lower.\nWhen aggregate demand falls, the price level begins to fall. As the price level falls, the quantity of goods and services that are sold begins to rise. The rise in the quantity of goods and services that are sold helps to increase GDP.\nAs the price level falls, the value of money changes. A fall in the price level will make money worth more.

A supply shock can lead to a change in the equilibrium price and quantity of output.\nWhen the price of resources increases, the cost of production increases. This will eventually lead to a decrease in the quantity of output produced. This is because producers will sell less of their product at the higher price. This is a decrease in supply.\nAn increase in the money supply increases the availability of money. This lowers the interest rate, which leads to an increase in the quantity of output produced.

An increase in fiscal expenditures or a decrease in fiscal taxes is called an expansionary fiscal policy. An decrease in fiscal expenditures or an increase in fiscal taxes is called a contractionary fiscal policy.\nExpansionary fiscal policy is designed to stimulate the economy. It increases the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and can increase the number of jobs. But there is a cost: expansionary fiscal policy can also increase inflation.\nContractionary fiscal policy is designed to slow the economy. It decreases the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and can decrease the number of jobs. But this can help reduce inflation.\nSOLUTION: Contractionary fiscal policy in the United States is likely to affect domestic interest rates and the international value of the dollar.\nInterest rates decrease and the dollar appreciates.\nWhen the U.S. government cuts spending and/or increases taxes, the total demand for goods and services in the United States decreases. This decrease in demand can cause prices to fall. Inflation falls.\nWhen inflation decreases, interest rates decrease. The figure below shows how this happens.\nThe dotted line shows the supply of money. The solid line shows the quantity of money demanded. When the supply of money increases, the quantity of money demanded increases. But when the supply of money increases, the price levels increase. So, the quantity of money demanded increases at a slower rate than the price levels.\nAs the world's central bank, the Federal Reserve plays a major role in determining U.S. interest rates. When the Federal Reserve wants to decrease interest rates, it lowers the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight.\nThe international value of the dollar is affected by the interest rates. When interest rates decrease, the international value of the dollar increases.\nThe international value of the dollar is the price of the dollar in terms of other countries' currencies.

For example, if Bart lends $1,000 and receives the money back in 5 years, the value of the $1,000 will be less in 5 years than it is today. This means that Bart will be hurt by the inflation."}

The price level is the sum of the prices of all the goods and services in an economy. The table below shows how inflation can happen.\nWhen the government increases the money supply, the economy will experience inflation if the central bank does not raise interest rates. An increase in the money supply increases the demand for goods and services, and sellers will raise prices to get rid of the excess money.\nWhen labor costs increase, the economy will experience inflation if the corporate world does not cut back on production.

When prices go up, the value of money goes down. This is called inflation.\nInflation is when the average price level goes up. The average price level goes up when the prices of most goods and services go up.\nWhat happens when inflation happens?\nWhen the average price level goes up, every dollar you have is worth less. This means that you will be able to buy fewer goods and services.\nFor example, if the average price level goes up by 10%, then a good that cost $100 before will cost $110 after. So, a $100 bill will buy you fewer dollars than it did before.\nSOLUTION: The people who will suffer the most from a rising price level are those with fixed money incomes.\nA fixed money income is an income that stays the same. For example, a person who has a job that pays a fixed salary will have the same income whether prices go up or down.\nIf prices go up, the value of a fixed money income goes down. The person will be able to buy fewer goods and services than before."}

The curve is upward-sloping, which means that if the price firms receive for their output goes up, the quantity of output that they sell also goes up. This happens because when the price firms receive goes up, producers make more goods and sellers sell more output.\nThe aggregate supply curve is affected by the prices of the inputs used to produce output. The price of each input is included in the cost of producing each item of output. If the price of an input rises, the cost of producing that output rises, and so the quantity of output that firms produce and sell tends to fall.\nThe aggregate supply curve is also affected by the expectations of firms and workers. If firms and workers expect that the price level will increase, they will raise their prices and wages. When prices and wages are higher, the cost of producing goods and services is higher, and so the quantity of output that firms produce and sell tends to fall.\nSOLUTION: When demand increases in the intermediate range of the aggregate supply curve, the price level and the quantity of real GDP both increase.\nThe intermediate range of the aggregate supply curve is the part of the curve that is above the aggregate supply curve's minimum point, where the price level is increasing and the quantity of real GDP is increasing.\nAn increase in demand in the intermediate range of the aggregate supply curve is illustrated by the blue area on the graph.

When the Federal Reserve wants to increase the money supply, it can print more money or raise the ink supply to banks. When the Federal Reserve wants to decrease the money supply, it can print less money or lower the ink supply to banks.\nSOLUTION: To decide which answer is correct, consider what happens to interest rates and spending when the money supply decreases.\nWhen the money supply decreases, interest rates must go up because there is less money available to lend. When interest rates go up, borrowing will decrease because it costs more to borrow money. But because businesses and people usually borrow to spend, a decrease in borrowing means that they will spend less. So, when the money supply decreases, the economy will experience a decrease in spending."}

When the government increases government spending or decreases taxes, the government multiplier will likely increase. The government multiplier is the ratio of the change in national income to the change in government spending or taxes.\nThe government multiplier is greater than 1. This means that the change in national income is greater than the change in government spending or taxes. The multiplier effect is responsible for this. The multiplier effect is the increase in aggregate demand that occurs when an initial change in demand occurs.\nThe multiplier effect happens because workers and businesses receive income from the initial change in government spending or taxes. When they receive this income, they spend some of it on goods and services. This creates an increase in demand that is equal to the multiplier effect.\nThe government multiplier can be less than 1 if the tax spending multiplier changes in the opposite direction of the government spending multiplier.\nSOLUTION: To determine if the tax multiplier increases in magnitude when the MPC increases, look at the opposite change. When the MPC decreases, the tax multiplier decreases. So, the tax multiplier must increase when the MPC increases."}

If the supply of a currency increases and the demand for it stays the same, the value of the currency will fall. This is called a currency devaluation. When the value of a currency falls, the currency buys fewer goods and services.\nA country's interest rates are determined by its central bank. The central bank for the United States is the Federal Reserve. If the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, it means that it costs less to borrow money. This can help American consumers and businesses, but it can also make the United States a more attractive place for investors to put their money. When the United States becomes a more attractive place to invest, the supply of dollars goes up and the demand for them stays the same, which causes the value of the dollar to rise.\nThe value of the dollar changes based on many factors. It is important to understand these factors to predict whether the value of the dollar will go up or down.\nSOLUTION: The international value of the dollar will appreciate if American interest rates fall relative to interest rates in other countries.

This is called the currency's purchasing power. When the purchasing power of a currency goes up, the currency is said to appreciate. When the purchasing power of a currency goes down, the currency is said to depreciate.\nThe graph below shows how the purchasing power of a currency can change. For example, the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar goes up when the savings rate in the United States goes up. This is because more money is being saved in the United States. More money is available for investment, which makes the U.S. dollar more valuable.\nThe value of a currency also depends on the value of other currencies. When the value of a foreign currency goes up relative to the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar is said to depreciate relative to that currency. For example, the value of the U.S. dollar goes down when the European Central Bank raises interest rates. This happens because investors can earn higher interest rates in Europe, so they move their money into European currencies.\nSOLUTION: The domestic purchasing power of a currency varies directly with the cost of living.

A financial market is a place where money can be loaned and borrowed.\nThe table below shows how money and financial markets affect the economy.\n | Money | Financial markets | Economy\nThe money supply affects the interest rate. The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money. When the money supply is high, the interest rate is low. When the money supply is low, the interest rate is high.\nThe demand for money affects the interest rate. The demand for money is the amount of money that people want to hold. When the demand for money is high, the interest rate is high. When the demand for money is low, the interest rate is low.\nThe asset demand for money affects the exchange rate. The exchange rate is the price of one type of money in terms of another. When the asset demand for money is high, the exchange rate is high. This means that each type of money will buy fewer assets. When the asset demand for money is low, the exchange rate is low. This means that each type of money will buy more assets.\nThe types of financial markets are stock markets, bond markets, and commodity markets.\nIn a stock market, people buy and sell shares of ownership in a company.\nIn a bond market, people buy and sell shares of debt that a company has issued.\nIn a commodity market, people buy and sell raw materials.\nA macroeconomic recession is a general slowdown in the economy. A macroeconomic recession causes the demand for loanable funds to decrease. The demand for loanable funds is the amount of money that people want to borrow. When the demand for loanable funds is high, the interest rate is high. When the demand for loanable funds is low, the interest rate is low.\nSOLUTION: The demand for bonds increases the interest rate. When the demand for bonds increases, the price of bonds goes up. This means that the interest rate on bonds will go down.\nFor a given money supply if nominal GDP increases, the velocity of money decreases. The velocity of money is the speed at which money changes hands. When the velocity of money is high, people are spending and borrowing more money. When the velocity of money is low, people are spending and borrowing less money.\nWhen nominal GDP increases, people have more money to spend. But if people are spending and borrowing more money, the velocity of money will increase. So, the asset demand for money will decrease.\nA macroeconomic recession increases the demand for loanable funds. When the economy is in a recession, businesses and people have less money to spend.

The model is made up of two curves:\nAD: The Aggregate Demand curve shows how the price level affects real GDP. When the price level is higher, the quantity of goods and services demanded is lower. So, the AD curve slopes downward.\nAS: The Aggregate Supply curve shows how the price level affects employment. When the price level is higher, the quantity of goods and services supplied is higher. So, the AS curve slopes upward.\nThe intersection of the AD and AS curves shows the short-run equilibrium. If the price level is higher than the equilibrium price level, the quantity of goods and services traded is lower than the equilibrium quantity. So, real GDP is lower than the equilibrium real GDP.\nIf the price level is lower than the equilibrium price level, the quantity of goods and services traded is higher than the equilibrium quantity. So, real GDP is higher than the equilibrium real GDP.\nThe short-run equilibrium is located at the intersection of the AD and AS curves.

This chapter examines the three main ways an economy can exit a recession: increased government spending, expansionary monetary policy, and rising wages and prices.\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve has two main tools it can use to stabilize the economy. It can change the interest rate, which is the cost of borrowing money for the government, other businesses, and consumers. When the interest rate is lower, it costs less to borrow money. The Federal Reserve can also increase the money supply, or the amount of money in circulation. When the money supply increases, there is more money available to lend.\nFor an economy to exit a recession, the government can increase its spending on public transportation, infrastructure, and education. This spending can create jobs and increase income for households.\nWhen the economy is in a recession, the Federal Reserve can use expansionary monetary policy to lower interest rates and increase the money supply. Lower interest rates make borrowing money cheaper. This can help businesses expand and hire more workers. An increase in the money supply increases the amount of money available to lend. This can help lower interest rates and boost economic growth.\nRising wages and prices are not typically ways an economy exits a recession. When wages and prices are rising, it is a sign of inflation. Inflation is an increase in the general price level of goods and services. Inflation can make borrowing money more expensive. For example, when inflation rises, the interest rate on a loan may go up. This can slow economic growth.\nSOLUTION: To return to full employment, an economy in a recession can use expansionary monetary policy. By lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply, the Federal Reserve can stimulate economic growth and increase employment."}

This can lead to high unemployment, as shown in the figure to the right. In this situation, the central bank can help by increasing the money supply. When the money supply grows, the quantity of money demanded is also higher. With more money in circulation, people have more money to spend.

When the government spends more money, it must either raise taxes or borrow money from the public. Both of these moves take money away from the private sector, which reduces the amount of money available for private investment.\nThe crowding-out effect can occur when the government borrows money from the public. When the government borrows money, it takes money out of the hands of private investors. For example, when the government sells a bond, it is borrowing money from a bondholder. The bondholder puts money into the government by buying the bond, and that money is not available to be put into private investments.\nThe crowding-out effect can also occur when the government increases taxes. When the government collects more money in taxes, it takes money out of the hands of private investors. For example, if a company collects more sales taxes, it will have less money available to invest in new equipment or factories.\nSOLUTION: The crowding-out effect from government borrowing is best described as the effect of the President increasing the money supply which decreases real interest rates and increases AD.\nWhen the government borrows money, it must pay the interest on the debt. This requires it to collect more money from taxes or to borrow more money from the public. Both of these moves can take money away from the private sector, which reduces the amount of money available for private investment.\nThe crowding-out effect from government borrowing is like the effect of the President increasing the money supply.

Here are some ways that unemployment can occur:\nCyclical unemployment occurs when there is a decline in the economy. Many people are unemployed, and businesses suffer. This type of unemployment is called cyclical because it is related to the ups and downs of the business cycle.\nStructural unemployment occurs when there is a permanent change in the types of jobs that are available. For example, as businesses move out of a community, the workforce may become structurally unemployed.\nSOLUTION: This is a structural unemployment. Self-serve checkout stations replace grocery checkers. This is a permanent change in the types of jobs that are available."}

An expansionary fiscal policy is usually achieved by increasing government spending and/or decreasing taxes.\nWhen the economy is in an inflationary period, the government can use contractionary fiscal policy to reduce inflation. A contractionary fiscal policy is usually achieved by decreasing government spending and/or increasing taxes.\nSOLUTION: To remedy a recession, the federal government should run a deficit and increase taxes and government spending.\nThis expansionary fiscal policy increases the demand for goods and services, which leads to higher employment and a higher level of economic activity."}
{"question": "Suppose that Tiger Woods buys a golf ball in England for $1 and the marginal propensity to consume in England is 0.75.

{"question": "Which of the following monetary policies would lessen the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decreasing the value of the domestic currency."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lowering the income tax rate."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lowering the discount rate."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Expansionary fiscal policy is created when government spending increases or when taxes decrease. When this happens, the government is spending more money or taking in less. The effect of expansionary fiscal policy is to increase the demand for goods and services and to stimulate aggregate demand.\nSOLUTION: A decreasing value of the domestic currency would make imported goods and services less expensive compared to domestic goods and services. As a result, domestic consumers would buy more domestic products and fewer imported products. This would increase the demand for domestic products and shift the demand curve to the right.\nHowever, the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy is to increase the demand for goods and services. A decreasing value of the domestic currency would counteract this effect by making imported goods and services less expensive.\nLowering the income tax rate would decrease the level of taxes collected by the government. This would put more money into the hands of consumers and increase the demand for goods and services. The demand for goods and services would increase by the full amount of the tax decrease.\nSelling Treasury securities to commercial banks would increase the interest that the government pays to investors. This would decrease the demand for bonds and other interest-bearing securities. The demand for goods and services would decrease, because investors would have less money to spend.\nLowering the discount rate would make borrowing less expensive. This would increase the demand for loans and boost the economy. Businesses would be able to get loans more easily and at lower interest rates. They would be able to spend more money on things like new equipment and expansions. The demand for goods and services would increase."}

It shows that for every increase in the money supply, there is an increase in the price level. The price level is a measure of the general level of prices in the economy.\nThe equation of exchange can also be used to show what happens when the money supply changes. If V is the velocity of money, then the equation becomes:\nM \u00d7 V = P \u00d7 Q\nThis equation tells you that when the money supply is increased, the price level will also increase. This is because the same amount of money is chasing more goods and services.\nThe velocity of money is a measure of how much money is changing hands in the economy. For example, when people go out to eat, the server will collect money for the food and beverages. The velocity of money will increase when people go out to eat. This is because the money used to pay the server ends up in the server's hands. The server can then spend that money on food or other goods and services.\nSOLUTION: If V and Q are constant, then the money supply must be proportional to the price level. This is because when V and Q are constant, the money supply and price level are determined by each other."}

When the government spends money or lowers taxes, it increases the fiscal burden. The fiscal burden is the amount of money the government takes in from taxes.\nFiscal policy can have a powerful effect on the economy. For example, when the government spends more money or lowers taxes, the increased fiscal burden puts more money into the hands of households and businesses. This increase in demand for goods and services can cause prices to rise and economic growth to increase.\nHowever, fiscal policy is not always effective. Some limitations of fiscal policy include:\nCrowding out occurs when increased government spending raises interest rates. Higher interest rates can reduce private investment and consumption, canceling out the effect of the fiscal policy.\nRational expectations is the idea that people and businesses adjust their expectations to anticipate government actions. If people and businesses correctly anticipate future government spending or tax cuts, they will not change their behavior as much as the government intends.\nThe balanced budget amendment would prohibit the government from running budget deficits. While fiscal policy involves the government's spending or taxation, it does not address how the government will pay for that spending or tax cuts. A balanced budget amendment would bind the government's hands and violate the government's principles of flexibility and discretion.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nBoth crowding out and rational expectations tell you that fiscal policy is not always effective. The balanced budget amendment would prohibit the government from running budget deficits, but this amendment would not address how the government will pay for that spending or tax cuts."}

A protective tariff is designed to limit the import of goods into a country. A protective tariff makes imported goods more expensive, which helps domestic businesses compete.\nA protective tariff can have several consequences:\nIt can help domestic industries. A protective tariff can increase the price of imported goods. This increase can make domestic goods cheaper by comparison. So, a protective tariff can help domestic businesses sell more of their products.\nIt can raise the price of imported goods. A protective tariff makes imported goods more expensive. So, consumers will buy less of these goods. This can cause problems for domestic businesses that sell goods or services that use imported products.\nIt can lower income for some people. A protective tariff can raise the price of imported goods. This can decrease the demand for these goods. This can lead to lower income for domestic businesses that sell imported goods. It can also lower the income of consumers who buy imported goods.\nIt can increase income for other people. A protective tariff can increase the price of imported goods. This can increase the income of domestic businesses that sell products that compete with imported goods.\nIt can decrease economic efficiency. A protective tariff can change the price of goods. These price changes can lead to suboptimal levels of production and consumption. This can decrease economic efficiency.\nSOLUTION: A protective tariff is a tax on imported goods. This tax makes imported steel more expensive. So, domestic steel consumers will buy less of it. The income they have is reduced.\nThe income of domestic steel producers increases. They can now sell their steel at a lower price and still make a profit.\nThe tax also transfers income from domestic steel to foreign steel producers. They must now pay the tax if they want to sell their steel in the domestic market."}

They do not require deliberate changes.\nWhen the economy is in a recession, government spending and tax revenue both decrease. As a result, the government's budget will shift from a surplus to a deficit. This deficit will automatically increase aggregate demand, and the economy will begin to grow again.\nSome examples of automatic stabilizers are:\nA decrease in government spending due to a recession will decrease the government's budget surplus. This will automatically increase the deficit and increase aggregate demand.\nA decrease in tax revenue due to a recession will cause the government's budget to shift from a surplus to a deficit. This will automatically increase the deficit and increase aggregate demand.\nSOLUTION: Choice D is the correct answer.\nDuring a recession, the government can increase its budget surplus by decreasing spending or increasing taxes. This will decrease aggregate demand, which will put the economy back in balance. This response to a recession is called a fiscal contraction.\nA fiscal contraction is a type of automatic stabilizer. It is designed to help stabilize the economy."}

The curve is upward-sloping, which means that an increase in the price level leads to an increase in the quantity of output that firms produce. This is because at a higher price level, firms can earn higher profits and so are willing to produce and sell more goods and services.\nThere are several reasons why the aggregate supply curve will shift to the right:\nThe price level increases.\nThe quantity of output that firms produce increases when the price level increases. This happens because the higher price level makes producers and sellers more willing to sell their goods and services. As a result of this increase in supply, the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right.\nThe expectations for future prices are higher.\nIf producers and sellers expect that prices will increase in the future, they will be willing to sell their goods and services at a higher price today. This increase in supply leads to a rightward shift of the aggregate supply curve.\nThe aggregate supply curve will shift to the left if:\nThe price level decreases.\nThe quantity of output that firms produce decreases when the price level decreases.

The curve is a downward-sloping straight line. The curve shows that a nation has a finite amount of resources. When a nation uses its resources to produce one good, it has fewer resources available to produce another good.\nAs a nation produces more of one good, it must produce less of the other good. The curve shows the different combinations of goods that a nation can produce with its given amount of resources. The curve is a straight line. This line shows that a nation has a finite possibility of producing goods.\nA nation can produce inside its production possibility curve, which means that the nation is producing a combination of goods that is inside the curve. This can happen because a nation is using its resources more efficiently or because the nation is producing a new good.\nA nation can produce outside its production possibility curve, which means that the nation is producing a combination of goods that is outside the curve. This can happen because a nation is using its resources more productively or because the nation has access to more resources.\nSOLUTION: A nation is producing inside its production possibility curve. This outcome is possible if the nation has experienced slower than usual technological progress. Technological progress is the improvement in the technology used to produce goods and services. New technologies can help a nation produce more output with the same amount of resources. But technological progress does not happen automatically. A nation must invest in research and development to experience technological progress.\nThe production possibility curve is a straight line. This line shows that a nation has a finite possibility of producing goods. A nation can produce inside its production possibility curve, which means that the nation is producing a combination of goods that is inside the curve. This outcome is possible if the nation has experienced a permanent decrease in its production capacity. A permanent decrease in production capacity happens if a nation's resources are depleted or damaged.\nA nation is producing outside its production possibility curve, which means that the nation is producing a combination of goods that is outside the curve. This outcome is possible if the nation has experienced a technological breakthrough. A technological breakthrough is a large increase in the productivity of resources. A technological breakthrough allows a nation to produce more output with the same amount of resources. But technological breakthroughs do not happen often.\nA nation is experiencing an economic recession, which is a downturn in the economy. A recession can decrease the demand for a nation's products. As a result of the decrease in demand, a nation's production of goods and services will decrease. But a recession does not necessarily make a nation produce inside its production possibility curve."}

When the Federal Reserve buys securities on the open market, it pays for them by writing a check. This act of writing a check increases the money supply. When the Federal Reserve writes a check to buy securities from a bond trader, the bond trader is likely to use the money to buy a different type of security. This action drives the price of the security up and the interest rate down.\nContractionary monetary policy is designed to decrease the quantity of money and increase interest rates in the economy. When the Federal Reserve sells securities, it receives money from the buyer. This act of receiving money decreases the money supply. When the Federal Reserve sells securities to an investor, the investor is likely to use the money to buy a different type of security. This action drives the price of the security down and the interest rate up.\nSOLUTION: The Federal Reserve was concerned about the \"crowding-out\" effect, in which an increase in government spending caused private investment to decrease. If the Federal Reserve was engaged in this type of thinking, it would be using contractionary monetary policy. To do this, the Federal Reserve could raise the discount rate."}

This is because a decrease in the money supply lowers the amount of money consumers and businesses have to spend. When people have less money to spend, they buy less stuff. Businesses may respond to their customers buying less stuff by producing less. As a result of these changes, the price level and output in the economy decrease.\nSOLUTION: To decide if the money supply decreasing raises or lowers the price level in the economy, decide if the money supply decreasing causes the price level to go up or down.\nAccording to Keynesian analysis, a decrease in the money supply causes the price level to go down. So, a decrease in the money supply lowers the price level in the economy."}
{"question": "Suppose the exchange rates are 0.5 British Pound per dollar; 10 Mexican Pesos per dollar; and 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar. Further suppose that a Big Mac costs 3 dollars in America; 2 pounds in England; 50 pesos in Mexico; and 200 yuan in China. In which country is a Big Mac most expensive?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "America ($3)."}, {"label": "B", "text": "England ($4)."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mexico ($5)."}, {"label": "D", "text": "China ($2)."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Currency exchange rates affect the prices of goods and services sold in foreign countries. When the exchange rate is high, the prices of goods and services in foreign countries become cheaper for tourists and more expensive for foreign visitors. When the exchange rate is low, the prices of goods and services in foreign countries become more expensive for tourists and cheaper for foreign visitors.\nFor example, consider a U.S. tourist visiting Switzerland. The exchange rate is 1 Swiss franc to 0.5 U.S. dollars. A Swiss hot dog costs 5 francs. The equivalent price in U.S. dollars is 5 dollars / 0.5 francs per dollar = 10 francs.\nA French tourist visiting the United States can buy a hot dog for 5 dollars and get a better exchange rate, 0.5 euros = 1 U.S. dollar.\nSo, the Swiss hot dog is more expensive for the French tourist than the U.S. hot dog is for the American tourist.\nSOLUTION: Look at the price of a Big Mac in each country and the exchange rate for each currency.\nThe exchange rate for the Mexican peso is 10 pesos per dollar. So, 3 dollars is equivalent to 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 pesos.\nThe exchange rate for the Chinese yuan is 100 yuan per dollar. So, 200 yuan is equivalent to 200 / 100 = 2 dollars.\nThe exchange rate for the British pound is 0.5 pounds per dollar. So, 2 pounds is equivalent to 2 \u00d7 0.5 = 1 dollar.\nTherefore, a Big Mac is most expensive in China."}

The Law of Supply tells you that when the price of something goes up, the quantity that producers are willing to supply also goes up. So, in the long run, theAS curve is always upward sloping.\nThe long-run pattern of theAS curve is upward sloping. This means that when the price of a good or service goes up, the quantity that producers are willing to supply also goes up. This happens because as the price goes up, producers make more money. So, they are willing to supply more of the good or service.\nThe long-run pattern of theAS curve is not vertical. This means that an increase in the price of a good or service is not followed by an unlimited increase in the quantity that producers are willing to supply. The increase in price will eventually lead to a new equilibrium, where the quantity bought and the price are no longer equal.\nThe long-run pattern of theAS curve is not horizontal. This means that a change in the price of a good or service does not keep the quantity bought and the price equal. The quantity bought and the price will eventually move to a new equilibrium.\nSOLUTION: TheAS curve is always upward sloping in the long run. This means that when the price of a good or service goes up, the quantity that producers are willing to supply also goes up. So, in the long run, the AS curve is always upward sloping."}

This saving creates a supply of loanable funds that can be used to finance investments. When borrowers and lenders interact, the interest rate comes into existence. The interest rate is the price of the loanable funds. It tells borrowers how much they will have to pay to get the loan. It tells lenders how much they will earn from their investment.\nThe interest rate affects the demand for and the supply of loanable funds. The demand for loanable funds is the amount of funds that borrowers want to borrow. The demand for loanable funds is affected by the interest rate and the planned investments of borrowers.\nThe supply of loanable funds is the amount of funds that lenders want to lend. The supply of loanable funds is affected by the interest rate and the savings of lenders.\nWhen the interest rate is high, borrowers are willing to borrow less, and lenders are willing to lend less. When the interest rate is low, borrowers are willing to borrow more, and lenders are willing to lend more.\nSOLUTION: The stock market is not the source of the supply of loanable funds. The stock market is a market where investors can buy and sell stocks.\nInvestors are not the source of the supply of loanable funds. Investors are people or companies that invest their money. Investors may use some of the money they earn from their investments to save. But the source of the savings is the savers.\nNet exports are not the source of the supply of loanable funds. Net exports are the amount by which exports exceeds imports. A country with a trade surplus has positive net exports.

In an economy, people work to produce goods and services. They buy some of the goods and services with their own money, and sell the rest.\nThe resources of an economy include the people who work, the machines and tools they use, and the land and other resources that are needed to produce goods and services.\nThere are many different kinds of resources. Some resources are private, which means that individuals and businesses own them. Other resources are public, which means that the government owns them.\nThe goals of an economy are to produce goods and services and to distribute them among the people. The government can influence how an economy performs. It can do this by changing the rules that govern an economy.\nFor example, the government can change the amount of money it spends on goods and services. When the government spends more money, it increases the demand for goods and services. When the government spends less money, it lowers the demand for goods and services.\nThe government can also change the taxes it takes from the people. When the taxes are lower, people have more money to spend. When taxes are higher, people have less money to spend.\nSOLUTION: A change in government spending will have a greater short-run impact on real output when the marginal propensity to consume is lower. The marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of each additional dollar that people spend.\nWhen the marginal propensity to consume is lower, people spend a smaller proportion of each additional dollar. So, a change in government spending will have a smaller effect on the economy."}

The Federal Reserve uses open market operations to try to keep the M2 money supply equal to its target level.\nIf the Federal Reserve buys bonds in the secondary market, it will increase the money supply. When the Federal Reserve buys bonds, it pays with money it has created. That money then enters the secondary market and joins the M2 money supply.\nSo, if the Federal Reserve buys bonds in the secondary market, the money supply will increase."}

Many countries are now turning to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, instead of non-renewable energy sources, such as coal and oil.\nRenewable energy sources are naturally replenished. This means that they are not finite, like non-renewable energy sources. As a result, renewable energy sources have a lower environmental impact and are more sustainable over the long term.\nNon-renewable energy sources are finite. This means that they will eventually run out. As a result, non-renewable energy sources have a higher environmental impact and are not sustainable over the long term.\nSOLUTION: The decision to save more for retirement increases the demand for loanable funds. This happens because the people are spending less money. When people spend less money, they are not using loanable funds. But loanable funds are still needed by businesses and governments. So, the demand for loanable funds decreases.\nThe supply of loanable funds is a function of savings. When people save more money, the supply of loanable funds increases. When people spend more money, the supply of loanable funds decreases."}

The spending multiplier is found by multiplying the marginal propensity to spend and the slope of the output intercept.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the reserve ratio increases the size of the tax multiplier. When banks have more reserves, they can use those reserves to pay off loans, and the loans become taxes. This increase in taxes increases the tax multiplier.\nAn increase in the marginal propensity to consume does not affect the tax multiplier.

It shows that there is a inverse relationship between these two variables. This means that when one of the variables is higher, the other is lower.\nThe curve is named after the economist A. W. Phillips, who first noticed this relationship in 1958.\nThe Phillips curve has two main interpretations. According to the naive interpretation, inflation and unemployment are moved by different segments of the economy. Inflation is caused by aggregate demand, and unemployment is caused by aggregate supply. The curve shows the trade-off between these two types of variables.\nAccording to the structural interpretation, inflation and unemployment are both caused by aggregate demand. The curve shows the trade-off between different types of aggregate demand, such as labor and goods.\nThe Phillips curve has some important implications. It suggests that there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This trade-off is important for economics and economic policy.\nIf unemployment is high, workers have more bargaining power, and they can demand higher wages. Higher wages lead to higher inflation.\nIf inflation is high, the government may use monetary or fiscal policy to reduce it. Monetary policy involves managing the money supply and interest rates. Fiscal policy involves managing government spending and taxes.\nSOLUTION: The Phillips curve represents the relationship between inflation and unemployment. The curve is represented by the equation:\nUnemployment rate = f(inflation rate)\nThe money supply and the real interest rate do not represent the relationship between inflation and unemployment."}

These programs help to prepare people for the jobs that businesses are looking to fill. They do this by teaching people the skills they need to do a certain job.\nAnother way that governments can promote economic growth is by regulating industry. Doing so can help to make sure that companies follow rules that protect people and the environment.

Fiscal policy involves using government spending and taxes to influence the economy.\nWhen the government increases its spending, the expenditure multiplier is used to determine how much the increase in spending will multiply the gross domestic product (GDP). The expenditure multiplier is the ratio of the change in GDP to the change in spending.\nWhen the government increases its taxes, the tax multiplier is used to determine how much the increase in taxes will reduce the GDP. The tax multiplier is the ratio of the change in GDP to the change in taxes.\nSOLUTION: The government of a country decides to increase government spending and taxes by the same amount in order to keep a balanced budget. The multipliers are 0.75 for both expenditure and taxes.\nSo, the change in GDP is equal to the expenditure multiplier multiplied by the change in expenditure. Since the change in expenditure is the same as the change in taxes, the change in GDP is also equal to the tax multiplier multiplied by the change in taxes.\nThe expenditure multiplier is 0.75, and the tax multiplier is also 0.75. So, the change in GDP is 0.75 times the change in taxes.\nSince the government increases its taxes and spending by the same amount, the change in taxes is equal to the change in spending. The change in spending is 4, and the change in taxes is also 4.\nSo, the change in GDP is 0.75 times 4, which is 3."}

The increase in supply means that, in the long run, the price of goods and services will decrease. The price level is a measure of the general level of prices in an economy.\nAt the same time, taxes are a type of price. When taxes are cut, the price of goods and services in the economy decreases. This decrease in price leads to an increase in the quantity of goods and services demanded. The increase in quantity demanded means that, in the long run, real GDP increases. Real GDP is a measure of the value of the goods and services produced in an economy.\nSOLUTION: When the President cuts taxes for consumers and increases spending on the military, the price level increases, and real GDP decreases.\nIn the long run, the increased military spending leads to an increase in the supply of goods and services. As a result, the price level increases. The price level affects the value of the currency.

When the actual rate of unemployment is equal to the natural rate of unemployment, the labor market is said to be in long-run equilibrium.\nThe production possibility curve shows the combinations of goods that an economy can produce when all the inputs are fully employed. The curve is downward sloping. This means that an economy can produce more of one good and less of another good as the inputs are fully employed.\nSOLUTION: Economic growth is an increase in the production possibility curve. As the economy grows, new technologies and capital are added to the economy. This increases the amount of output that can be produced with a given amount of inputs. As a result of the increased output, the production possibility curve shifts out.\nAn increase in the natural rate of unemployment is a leftward shift in long-run aggregate supply. As the economy grows, more people leave their homes to seek work in the city. This increases the number of people looking for jobs. If businesses find the workers they need, they will produce more goods and services. As a result of the increased production, the long-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the right.\nA decrease in the production possibility curve is a leftward shift in long-run aggregate supply. As the economy grows, new technologies and capital are added to the economy. Initially, these new technologies and capital are added to the part of the economy that produces goods and services. As a result of the increased output, the production possibility curve shifts out. But at some point, the new technologies and capital will be added to the part of the economy that enjoys leisure. When that happens, the production possibility curve will shift in.\nA rightward shift in long-run aggregate supply is a decrease in the production possibility curve. As the price of goods and services increases, firms find it more profitable to produce more of those goods and services. As a result of the increased production, the long-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the right. But at some point, the price of goods and services will increase enough to reduce the quantity demanded. When that happens, the long-run aggregate supply curve will shift in."}

The money market is a part of the financial system. The financial system is the set of institutions and processes that manage people's money.\nIn the money market, people buy and sell financial assets. These financial assets are things such as stocks and bonds. The money market helps determine the price of these financial assets. The price of a financial asset is called its price.\nThe interest rate is a key part of the money market. The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money. It is also the return on money that you lend. The interest rate affects the price of financial assets.\nWhen the interest rate rises, the price of bonds will usually rise. Bonds are loans that you make to a company or a government. As the interest rate rises, the price of bonds increases. The return on bonds has increased, making them more attractive to buy.\nWhen the interest rate falls, the price of stocks will usually rise. Stocks are shares of a company. As the interest rate falls, the price of stocks increases. The return on stocks has increased, making them more attractive to buy.\nThe value of the dollar in foreign currency markets will also be affected by the interest rate. The value of the dollar is the price of the dollar in foreign currency. When the interest rate rises, the value of the dollar in foreign currency markets will usually rise. This is because the returns on dollar-denominated financial assets have increased, making them more attractive to foreign investors.\nSOLUTION: Increased demand for U.S. Treasury bonds as financial assets will increase the demand for bonds. The increase in demand will put pressure on the price of bonds to rise. Since the price of a bond is equal to the interest rate, the interest rate will rise.\nThe increase in the interest rate will also cause the value of the dollar in foreign currency markets to rise.

When the government increases spending on goods and services that enterprises produce, it helps those enterprises sell more products. This creates a larger demand for goods and services. To fill this demand, enterprises have two options: hire more workers or increase the number of hours their existing workers work. Both of these options increase the supply of labor.\nAs a result of the increased supply of labor, the supply of human capital increases. Human capital refers to the skills and ideas that people use at work. When the supply of human capital increases, the supply of goods and services increases.\nSo, when the government increases spending on goods and services that enterprises produce, the largest increase in real GDP comes from the increase in the supply of goods and services.\nSOLUTION: When the government decreases spending on goods and services and does not change taxes, the largest decrease in real GDP comes from the decrease in the supply of goods and services. The decrease in spending on goods and services by the government means that there is less money being spent on goods and services. This means that the enterprises selling those goods and services will sell fewer products.\nThe enterprises will not have as much demand for their products, so they will not need as many workers. This means that the supply of labor will decrease. As a result of the decrease in the supply of labor, the supply of human capital will decrease. There are fewer skilled and experienced workers to produce goods and services.\nSo, the largest decrease in real GDP comes from the decrease in the supply of goods and services."}

This increase in the money supply leads to a decrease in interest rates.\nLower interest rates do several things. They make borrowing cheaper. This can persuade businesses to expand. It can also persuade people to buy homes.\nThe actions of businesses and people may lead to an increase in aggregate demand. A increase in aggregate demand means that more money is being spent on goods and services. When more money is spent on goods and services, prices tend to rise. As prices rise, the value of money falls.\nWhen the value of money falls, each dollar can buy fewer goods and services.

The government can use fiscal policy to counteract recessions and to help the economy grow.\nWhen the economy is in a recession, the government can use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. One way to do this is by decreasing taxes for consumers and businesses. When tax rates are reduced, consumers and businesses have more money to spend. This increase in spending can help to stimulate the economy.\nAnother way to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy is by increasing government purchases of goods and services. When the government spends more money on goods and services, that money will go to businesses and employees. Businesses and employees will have more money to spend, which can help to stimulate the economy.\nSOLUTION: To decide if real GDP rises or falls, look at how consumers, businesses, and the government are spending.\nDecreasing taxes for consumers and businesses and increasing government purchases will increase the money in the economy. Because there is more money in the economy, consumers, businesses, and the government will spend more money.\nMore spending by consumers, businesses, and the government will increase real GDP.\nThe increase in real GDP will not cause the price level to rise, however. This is because the increase in spending is due to a decrease in taxes and an increase in government purchases. The price level is determined by the relationship of the demand for goods and services to the supply of those goods and services. When the demand for goods and services changes, the price level will change. But the change in the demand for goods and services caused by the decrease in taxes and the increase in government purchases will be equal in size to the change in the supply of goods and services.

Unemployment is different from being out of work. You can be out of work and not be unemployed. For example, if you are running your own business and you have trouble selling it, you are out of work, but you are not unemployed.\nUnemployment happens when you are out of work and actively looking for work. To be considered unemployed, you must have done work in the past and be willing and able to work now. If you are new to the workforce or if you are re-entering the workforce, you may not be unemployed until you have tried to find a job.\nThere are many reasons why people may be unemployed.

When the average price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; inflation is a decline in the purchasing power of money.\nInflation has many costs. When the average price level rises, the value of money falls, and people must pay more for goods and services. This may lead to:\nA reduction in the real level of economic activity: As the price level rises, people will buy less than they otherwise would have.\nA decrease in the real value of investments: As the price level rises, the value of money falls, and the nominal, or actual, value of investments declines in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms.\nA reduction in the real wage: As the price level rises, the nominal wage falls in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms.\nAn increase in the real interest rate: When inflation rises, the nominal interest rate rises, and the real interest rate increases as well.\nHigh inflation can get worse if people start to expect and plan for higher levels of inflation in the future. This expectation can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as businesses and workers raise their prices and wages in response to expectations of higher inflation.\nSOLUTION: Wealth will be redistributed. is the answer. When inflation rises, the value of money falls, and people may have to pay more for goods and services. But inflation can make some investments worth more. For example, if inflation rises, the price of goods may go up, and the profits of businesses will rise with them. As a result of these changes, some people may earn more money than they did before inflation rose. Others may pay more for goods and services. This kind of redistribution of wealth is a cost of inflation. But the other choices are not costs of inflation."}

This happens because the amount of capital available to suppliers increases, which allows them to produce the good or service more quickly.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the unemployment rate leads to a leftward shift of long-run aggregate supply. This happens because some suppliers are not able to produce the good or service.\nAn increase in the real interest rate does not affect long-run aggregate supply. An increase in the real interest rate encourages investment in capital, but this does not affect the number of people willing to supply a good or service or the amount of time, effort, or capital they have available.\nIncreased investment in capital leads to a rightward shift of long-run aggregate supply. This happens because the amount of capital available to suppliers increases, which allows them to produce the good or service more quickly.\nAn increase in aggregate demand does not affect long-run aggregate supply. In the long run, the supply of a good or service is determined by the number of people willing to supply it and the amount of time, effort, and capital they have available. An increase in aggregate demand does not affect these factors."}

It tells you how much of a good or service is consumed as income increases.\nThe consumption function is typically upward-sloping, which means that consumers will buy more of a good or service as their income increases. This is because people tend to want to consume more of a good or service when their income increases.\nThe magnitude of the slope of the consumption function is called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). The MPC tells you the change in consumption that is caused by a change in income.\nFor example, if the MPC is 0.8, then for every additional dollar of income, consumption increases by 80 cents.\nIf the MPC is less than 1.0, then consumption does not increase as much as income. The MPC is less than 1.0 because people save some of their income.\nSOLUTION: If households are more optimistic about the future, they are likely to be more confident in their ability to afford a higher consumption level. This will increase their marginal propensity to consume, which means that the slope of the consumption function will increase.\nThe consumption function will shift upward, and the consumption level will increase for a given level of disposable income."}

In the early years of an economy, the primary limit to growth is the amount of capital, such as buildings, machines, and transportation equipment. As an economy grows, the limit to growth shifts to the amount of labor available to do the work. And in more mature economies, the limit to growth is often the speed at which capital and labor can be adjusted to meet the changing market.\nSOLUTION: Increases in the interest rate are the most likely to be a deterrent to growth in the economy. An interest rate is the cost of using money. When the interest rate goes up, it costs more to borrow money. This makes it more expensive for businesses to expand, and they may slow their growth."}

One of the most important reasons a country's trade balance switches to a surplus is an appreciation of the country's currency. An appreciation is usually the result of a decrease in the value of the currencies of other countries, as shown in the table below. When the value of other currencies decreases, the value of the country's currency increases.\nIf the currency of country A appreciates, then country A's exports become cheaper for foreign buyers. At the same time, country A's imports become more expensive. So, the trade balance for country A switches to a surplus.\nAnother factor that can cause a country's trade balance to switch to a surplus is a decrease in the level of income relative to other nations. When a country's level of income decreases relative to other nations, the country's exports become cheaper for foreign buyers. So, the trade balance for the country switches to a surplus.\nA balance of trade deficit can be the result of a loose monetary policy. When a country has a loose monetary policy, the value of its currency decreases. So, the country's exports become more expensive for foreign buyers, and the country's imports become cheaper. This switches the country's trade balance to a deficit.\nA balance of trade deficit can also be the result of foreigners having no taste for the country's products. If foreigners do not want to buy the country's products, then the country's imports will increase relative to its exports. This switches the country's trade balance to a deficit.\nSOLUTION: An appreciation of the country's currency can cause a switch to a surplus. Over time, the value of the currency increased, and country B's exports became cheaper for foreign buyers. At the same time, country B's imports became more expensive. So, the trade balance for country B switched to a surplus."}

This increase in prices leads to a reduction in the quantity demanded of each good and service. But because each transaction involves both a buyer and a seller, the reduction in the quantity demanded of a good or service leads to a reduction in the quantity supplied of that good or service. This reduction in the quantity supplied leads to a reduction in the total output of the economy. So, an uptick in the price level causes a decrease in real GDP.\nA decrease in the price level, by contrast, lowers the price of goods and services. This decrease in prices leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of each good and service. But because each transaction involves both a buyer and a seller, the increase in the quantity demanded of a good or service leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service. This increase in the quantity supplied leads to an increase in the total output of the economy. So, a decrease in the price level causes an increase in real GDP.\nSOLUTION: A decrease in investment causes a decrease in the quantity of capital available in the future. This decrease in the quantity of capital available in the future leads to a decrease in the total output of the economy. So, a decrease in investment causes a decrease in real GDP.\nA technological advance increases the productivity of labor. This increase in the productivity of labor allows workers to produce more goods and services in the same amount of time.

So, a decline in labor productivity causes a decrease in real GDP.\nAn uptick in net exports increases the quantity of goods and services produced. An uptick in net exports has both an increase in exports and a decrease in imports. An increase in exports increases the quantity of goods and services produced for foreign markets. A decrease in imports allows domestic consumers to buy more goods and services with the same amount of money. So, an uptick in net exports causes an increase in real GDP."}

Renewable resources include hydroelectric power, wind power, and solar power.\nA nonrenewable resource is one that can be used up. After a nonrenewable resource is used up, it cannot be used again. Fossil fuels are a type of nonrenewable resource.\nSOLUTION: The inflation rate fell from 3 percent to 2 percent. This means that the rate at which the price level is changing is slowing down. One effect of a decrease in the inflation rate is that the real value of a nation's debt may decrease. This is because inflation can erode the value of money over time. For example, if inflation is 3 percent, a dollar is worth less next year than it is this year. But if inflation is 2 percent, that same dollar is worth less next year than it is this year to a lesser extent.\nThe unemployment rate fell from 6 percent to 5 percent. This means that there are 5 percent less people who are out of work. The number of people who are unemployed is affecting the labor force. The labor force is the group of people who are working or who are out of work.

Because wages are a cost of doing business, employers will raise their prices to offset the higher wages. As a result, the curve will shift to the right.\nThe actual rate of inflation will increase if the inflation rate is higher than what is expected. For example, if the rate of inflation is 2% but people expected an inflation rate of 1%, the actual rate of inflation will increase.\nThe actual inflation rate will remain steady unless supply shocks set in. A supply shock is a change in the cost of doing business. For example, an increase in the cost of oil will increase the cost of gasoline. If the increase in the cost of oil is large enough, it can trigger a supply shock. When this happens, the inflation rate will increase.\nThese expectations will become reality if people's expectations of the future affect the future. For example, if people expect that the rate of inflation will increase, they will increase their prices. As a result, the actual rate of inflation will increase.\nSOLUTION: Prices are expected to rise more slowly in the future. The expectations are that the inflation rate will increase less than it did in the past. So, the Phillips curve will shift to the right."}

When a bank makes a loan, it creates money.\nA bank's reserves are the funds it has on hand to make good on its obligations. If a bank has $1000 in reserves and has made loans of $3000, it has created $3000 in deposits but has only $1000 in reserves. This means that the bank has created $2000 in new money.\nThe money multiplier is the amount of deposits a bank can create with each dollar of reserves. If the money multiplier is 10, a bank with $1000 in reserves can create $10,000 in deposits.\nThe reserve ratio is the amount of reserves a bank has compared to its deposits.

In the long run, the economy will be less active than it would have been if the money supply had not increased.\nThe crowding out problem is one reason why monetarists do not like deficit spending. When the government spends more money than it takes in, it must borrow money. The money it borrows is money that would otherwise be part of the money supply. As a result, the crowd out problem will occur.\nSOLUTION: From a monetarist point of view, the money supply should be increased steadily. This means that, in the long run, the value of each dollar will go down. This will cause people to spend and invest their money more quickly. The economy will be more active than it would have been if the money supply had not increased."}

There is no need for government intervention.\nIf demand exceeds supply, prices will rise, and consumers will buy less. Producers will then sell less of their products. SOLUTION: In the long run, the quantity theory of money says that the quantity of money in an economy will affect prices and the volume of economic activity. The quantity of money in an economy affects prices because when the total quantity of money in an economy increases, there is more money looking for the same amount of goods and services. This competition for goods and services drives prices up.\nThe volume of economic activity affects prices because when the total quantity of money in an economy increases, more money is being used to buy goods and services. This increases the demand for goods and services, which in turn increases prices.\nThe choices are incorrect because they do not match the classical view. Fining tuning the economy is an example of government intervention. The demand curve for money is not flat, and there is no serious risk of a liquidity trap. The aggregate supply curve is not L-shaped."}

As a result, people will tend to buy fewer Mexican-made goods and services. This will decrease the demand for Mexican-made textiles and, by extension, for the Mexican peso. So, an increase in interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries will shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the right.\nA lower rate of inflation in Mexico compared to other countries will decrease the expected inflation rate in Mexico. As a result, people will tend to buy more Mexican-made goods and services. This will increase the demand for Mexican-made textiles and, by extension, for the Mexican peso. So, a lower rate of inflation in Mexico relative to other countries will shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the left.\nA decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles will decrease the demand for Mexican-made textiles. This will decrease the demand for the Mexican peso. So, a decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles will shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the left.\nAn increase in the price of the Mexican peso relative to the prices of other currencies will increase the cost of importing goods and services. As a result, people will tend to buy fewer goods and services. This will decrease the demand for the Mexican peso.

Governments use import quotas to restrict the amount of a good that is allowed into a country.\nA country may use import quotas to protect its domestic industries from foreign competition. For example, if an imported good is cheaper than a domestic good, an import quota can keep out the cheaper good, allowing the domestic industry to remain competitive.\nImport quotas can also be used to protect consumers from the effects of price increases that can result from too much foreign competition. For example, if many foreign countries are producing a good, and then a war breaks out, the price of the good may go up. An import quota can keep the price of the good down.\nSOLUTION: Import quotas increase the price of imported goods. When the government limits the amount of a good that is allowed into the country, there is less competition among sellers. As a result, the sellers who are allowed to operate in the country can charge higher prices.\nThe graph below shows what happens with imported goods and their price when an import quota is imposed. The initial price is shown by the D1 curve. The post-quota price is shown by the D2 curve."}

When this happens, the government is spending more money than it is taking in from taxes. To finance the budget deficit, the government will issue more bonds. The bonds are then sold to investors.\nThe sale of bonds by the government to finance a budget deficit leads to an increase in the demand for bonds. As a result, the price of bonds will rise, and the interest rate on bonds will decrease. This is how contractionary fiscal policy can cause the crowding-out effect.\nContractionary fiscal policy is when the government decreases its spending. When the government decreases its spending, it decreases the money supply. The money supply is made up of the bills and coins in circulation and the money that banks have on hand. When the money supply decreases, interest rates will increase.\nThe crowding-out effect is the result of the increase in interest rates from contractionary fiscal policy. When interest rates increase, borrowing costs for businesses and households increase. This makes it more difficult for businesses to expand and grow, and it makes it more difficult for households to borrow money to buy a home or car."}

When the government's interest rates are low, businesses and individuals are more likely to borrow money. When the government's interest rates are high, businesses and individuals are more likely to save their money.\nThe nation's currency is used by people in different countries to exchange goods and services. If the nation's currency is depreciated, it takes more of the currency to buy a certain amount of goods and services. This means that the currency has less buying power.\nSOLUTION: To determine the potential side effect of paying down part of the national debt, consider the table below. It shows how the government's interest rates and the nation's currency can be affected by government spending and saving decisions.\n | Government spending | | Government saving | |\n| | | | | |\nIncrease | Increase | Depreciate | |\n| | | | | |\nDecrease | Decrease | Appreciate | |\n| | | | | |\nThe table shows that paying down part of the national debt can decrease interest rates and risk an inflationary period. This can happen because the government is saving money. When the government saves money, the interest rates on those savings tends to go down. When interest rates on the savings of households and businesses go down, they are likely to increase their spending. Increased spending can lead to an inflationary period, in which prices go up and the value of money goes down."}

When interest rates go up, it becomes more expensive for businesses to borrow money. So, they will usually spend less money.\nSOLUTION: Higher interest rates that decrease private investment lead to a decrease in demand for goods and services. When interest rates go up, businesses will spend less money on new investments. So, the demand for goods and services will decrease.\nThe other choices describe ways in which expansionary fiscal policy can be lessened.\nAn increase in the marginal propensity to consume refers to an increase in the amount of money people spend.

This action drives up the interest rate, making it more expensive for private firms to borrow money. As a result, private investment falls, and the crowding out occurs.\nThe Laffer effect is the idea that public revenue will increase if the government lowers tax rates. This effect is named after Art Laffer, who illustrated this concept with a curve. The curve shows that the government's revenue will be highest when the tax rate is lowest.\nFiscal defeat is when the government's spending increases are met with a decline in private spending. For example, a decrease in consumer spending caused by a rise in interest rates will be accompanied by a decrease in private investment spending. This decline in private spending offsets the economic stimulus that the government intended to achieve with its spending.\nZero policy effectiveness is when a change in government policy does not have any effect on the economy. This outcome may occur when the interest rate is at its natural rate, which is the rate at which the economy is most stable.\nSOLUTION: This decrease in real investment is most commonly called crowding out. When the government increases its purchases and borrows more funds, it drives up the interest rate. This higher interest rate causes private investment to decrease."}

When the Federal Reserve wants to reduce the rate of growth of the economy, it can implement a contractionary monetary policy, which involves making interest rates higher and the money supply lower.\nThe following graph shows how contractionary monetary policy works:\nThe interest rate rises, and the money supply decreases. Both of these changes make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money. As a result, businesses cut back on their spending, which includes hiring new employees.\nThe unemployment rate rises as a result of the decrease in spending. The number of people looking for jobs is so high that some of them are unable to find jobs, and the unemployment rate rises.\nSOLUTION: A contractionary monetary policy leads to a decrease in the unemployment rate, but it leads to an increase in the interest rate.\nIf a nation is operating at full employment and the central bank engages in contractionary monetary policy, the interest rate the purchases of new homes and the unemployment rate will change in the following ways:\nInterest rates will increase. The cost of borrowing money will be higher, which will slow down the pace of home purchases.\nThe unemployment rate will increase.

This shift has shaken the traditional belief that exports are an important mechanism for growing a nation's economy. Many people now believe that focusing on imports is just as important as focusing on exports.\nImports and exports are the parts of international trade that affect the rest of the world. Imports are the parts of a country's trade that come from other countries. Exports are the parts of a country's trade that go to other countries.\nAn increase in exports or a decrease in imports helps to grow a nation's economy. This happens because exports add to the nation's gross domestic product, or GDP, and because imports reduce the GDP.\nA country's GDP is the sum of the value of all the goods and services produced within the country. When a country exports goods and services, it is selling those goods and services to people outside the country. The value of those exports is added to the country's GDP. When a country imports goods and services, it is buying those goods and services from people outside the country. The value of those imports is subtracted from the country's GDP.\nSOLUTION: A tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by boosting saving investment and thus capital accumulation. This statement would not work against the beliefs of supply-side economists. Supply-side economists believe that tax cuts can increase the incentives for work and investment, which can lead to higher output and income.\nA tax increase is likely to decrease aggregate supply by decreasing after-tax wages and thus providing disincentives to work. This statement would work against the beliefs of supply-side economists. Supply-side economists believe that tax cuts can increase the incentives for work and investment, which can lead to higher output and income. Tax increases make working and investing less rewarding, which will decrease output and income.\nA tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by providing greater rewards for risk taking. This statement is not necessarily true. Many supply-side economists believe that the increased incentives for risk taking are not the main way in which tax cuts increase aggregate supply. Instead, supply-side economists believe that the increased incentives for work and investment are the main ways in which tax cuts increase aggregate supply.\nTax changes cause shifts in aggregate supply that work against shifts in aggregate demand thus reducing the effect of the tax change on real GDP. This statement would work against the beliefs of supply-side economists. Supply-side economists believe that tax cuts can increase the incentives for work and investment, which can lead to higher output and income. An increase in output and income will not be completely offset by a decrease in demand."}

A country's central bank, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, can increase or decrease the money supply by buying or selling government bonds.\nWhen the central bank buys government bonds from banks, it is essentially lending money to the banks. This event is called open market operations. When the central bank lends money to the banks, the amount of money in the economy increases. This increase in the money supply causes the interest rate to drop and aggregate demand to rise.\nWhen the central bank sells government bonds to banks, it is essentially taking money out of the economy. This event is called open market operations. When the central bank takes money out of the economy, the amount of money in the economy decreases. This decrease in the money supply causes the interest rate to rise and aggregate demand to fall.\nSOLUTION: The reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks are required to hold in their reserves. If the reserve ratio is 10%, then banks are required to hold reserves equal to 10% of their deposits.\nIf the Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, the banks' reserves increase by $1 million. Because the reserve ratio is 10%, the banks can now hold $1 million more in reserves. So, the banks do not need to borrow as much money from the Fed.\nThe table below shows what happens to the money supply and interest rate when the Fed buys securities from banks.\nBefore the Fed buys securities, the money supply is $10 million and the interest rate is 5%.\nAfter the Fed buys securities, the money supply is $11 million and the interest rate is 4.5%.\nThe money supply increases by $1 million, and the interest rate falls by 0.5%."}

The rows show the passing of time, from now to 10 years from now.\nThe country's output grows from $1,000 to $1,600 over the 10-year period.\nSOLUTION: To determine which policy is most likely to produce stronger economic growth over time, look at how each policy affects the components of output.\nInvestment tax credits incentivize businesses to invest more money in the economy. When businesses invest more money, they usually buy capital goods, such as new machines.\nCapital goods are capital goods that businesses use to produce goods and services. An increase in the stock of capital goods makes workers more productive. And since each worker can produce more goods and services with the help of capital goods, the economy grows.\nHigher adult illiteracy rates reduce the supply of labor. Labor is a factor of production. When the supply of labor goes down, the price of labor goes up.\nAs the price of labor goes up, other things equal, the supply of goods and services produced by businesses goes down. The economy grows at a slower rate.\nA falling stock of capital goods reduces the amount of capital available to workers. This means that workers cannot produce as much. So, the economy grows at a slower rate.\nMore rapid consumption of natural resources also reduces the stock of capital goods. When the stock of capital goods goes down, the economy grows at a slower rate."}

One of the key roles of the Federal Reserve is to conduct monetary policy. Monetary policy is the process of managing the money supply and interest rates to promote a healthy economy.\nThe Federal Reserve can conduct expansionary monetary policy to stimulate a weak economy. Expansionary policy increases the money supply and lowers interest rates. Some tools the Federal Reserve can use to conduct expansionary policy include reducing the federal funds rate, purchasing securities, and increasing the money supply.\nWhen the Federal Reserve uses each tool, the money supply increased. The money supply is the total amount of money in circulation. The table below shows how the Federal Reserve can increase the money supply.\nTool | How the Federal Reserve uses the tool to increase the money supply\nincrease the reserves of banks | Banks have reserve requirements. Reserve requirements are sums of money that banks must hold in reserve against deposits. If the reserve requirement is 10%, a bank must hold 10% of its deposits in reserve. The Federal Reserve can instruct banks to increase the amount of money they hold in reserve. This reduces the amount of money that banks can lend. This, in turn, decreases the money supply.\npurchase securities | The Federal Reserve can purchase securities from banks. Purchasing securities requires banks to exchange their securities for money. The money then enters the banks' reserves. The banks can now use the money to make new loans.

When the central bank expands the money supply, or when it lowers the interest rate, the cost of borrowing money decreases. This decrease in the cost of money stimulates investment and consumption, leading to an increase in aggregate demand.\nIf the demand for money is perfectly elastic, an expansionary monetary policy is quite effective. In this case, the central bank can increase the money supply, and the quantity of money demanded will increase by an equal amount. The increase in the money supply will not lead to an increase in the price level, as the increased money supply is accompanied by an equal increase in the demand for money.\nHowever, the demand for money is rarely perfectly elastic. Typically, the demand for money is relatively inelastic, meaning that people tend to hold on to their money when times are tough. In this case, a decrease in the interest rate will not stimulate as much investment and consumption as it would if the demand for money were elastic.\nContractionary monetary policy is the opposite of expansionary monetary policy. When the central bank contracts the money supply, or when it raises the interest rate, the cost of borrowing money increases. This increase in the cost of money decreases investment and consumption, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand."}

The government puts laws and regulations in place to help the economy grow.\nWhen the economy grows, it means that the value of the goods and services produced by the country or region grows. This growth is usually measured by a statistic called real Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nThere are several ways the government can increase real GDP:\n1. Increase government spending. When the government spends more money, it puts more money into the economy. This increase in government spending can stimulate businesses to spend more money, which can increase employment and output.\n2. Decrease taxes. When taxes are lower, people have more money to spend. This increased spending can lead to more business activity and higher employment.\n3. Increase net exports. Net exports are the difference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and the value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country's net exports increase, it means that the country is selling more goods and services to other countries. Since the economy is made up of all the goods and services produced by a country or region, an increase in net exports can increase real GDP.\nAn increase in the real rate of interest does not increase real GDP. An increase in the real rate of interest makes it more expensive to borrow money. This increase in the cost of borrowing can slow business investment and consumption, which can decrease employment and output.\nSOLUTION: To decide whether an increase in government spending, an increase in net exports, or a decrease in taxes would increase real GDP, look at the direction of the effect. An increase in government spending and a decrease in taxes will increase output and employment, which will increase real GDP. An increase in net exports will increase output and employment, which will increase real GDP.\nAn increase in the real rate of interest will not increase real GDP.

It was created in 1913 to manage the money supply and lend money to banks.\nThe Fed has three main roles:\n1. Manage the money supply: The Fed helps to decide what money is worth by controlling the amount of money in circulation.\nWhen there is more money in circulation, each dollar is worth less. This is called inflation.\nWhen there is less money in circulation, each dollar is worth more. This is called deflation.\nThe Fed aims to keep the rate of inflation around 2%. This means that the average price level in the economy increases about 2% per year.\nIf the average price level goes up more than 2% in a year, the economy is experiencing inflation. If the average price level goes up less than 2% in a year, the economy is experiencing deflation.\nLend money to banks: Banks use the money they get from the Fed to lend to people and businesses. This makes it cheaper for people and businesses to borrow money.\nThe Fed also uses this power to help stabilize the economy. For example, during a financial crisis, the Fed might lend money to banks at a lower interest rate than usual. This can help the banks stay afloat and keep lending to people and businesses.\nBe the U.S. government's bank: The Fed is the bank for the U.S. government. It takes in the government's money, stores it, and then lends it back to the government when needed. This helps the government raise money and manage its money.\nSOLUTION: The Federal Reserve is in control of the money supply. The Fed manages the money supply by controlling the amount of money in circulation."}

They thought that if the Federal Reserve increased the money supply, inflation would occur. This belief led to the idea that the Federal Reserve could use the money supply to control inflation.\nHowever, this belief was incorrect. In the United States, the Federal Reserve has a mandate from the Congress to maintain a low, stable inflation rate. To do this, the Federal Reserve aims to keep the inflation rate at around 2 percent per year.\nThe actual causes of inflation are not completely understood. Some factors that can cause inflation are an increase in the money supply, an increase in wages and prices at the same time, and an increase in the cost of goods and services.\nWhen the nation is at full employment, inflationary pressures can arise. To prevent these pressures from exceeding 2 percent, the Federal Reserve may use its tools to reduce the inflation rate. The Federal Reserve can use these tools to increase the interest rate, make it more difficult for people to borrow money, and reduce the growth of the money supply.\nSOLUTION: The government increased spending and raised taxes, which led to short-run economic growth but increased the deficit. The Federal Reserve increased the discount rate to curb inflation, but this action also helped to slow the economy.\nThe combination of policies that is most likely to have brought the economy to its current level of real GDP is an increase in government spending and an increase in taxes. This combination of policies added to short-run economic growth but increased the deficit."}

When the government spends money or lowers taxes, it is engaging in expansionary fiscal policy. When the government raises taxes or cuts spending, it is engaging in contractionary fiscal policy.\nFiscal policy can have an impact on inflation. Expansionary fiscal policy can cause inflation to increase. This happens because the increased government spending stimulates the economy, and the higher production leads to higher prices. For example, if a government increases its spending on defense, the defense industry will need to produce more weapons. This increased production will lead to a higher demand for weapons, and the higher demand will lead to higher prices.\nConversation fiscal policy can help remedy inflation. If the government runs a surplus, it saves money. To save money, it must reduce its spending, lower its taxes, or both. Lowering taxes can stimulate the economy by giving people more money to spend. This increase in spending can lead to higher prices, but the increase will be smaller than the increase that followed the expansionary fiscal policy."}

If the number of dollars in the economy is 100, then the total amount spent in the economy is 500.\nThe velocity of money is important because it affects the supply of money and the demand for money. The supply of money is affected because for each purchase, the seller's dollar is put into circulation to be spent again. The demand for money is affected because when people spend money, they want to hold on to the money that is left over.\nSOLUTION: To calculate the velocity of money, use the following formula:\nVelocity of money = (the average number of times a dollar is used in a year) / (the number of dollars in the economy)\nThe average number of times a dollar is used in a year is 5.

An expansionary fiscal policy is a increase in government spending or a decrease in taxes. When a central bank buys government bonds, it is engaging in an expansionary monetary policy.\nExpansionary monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy both increase the money supply. This increase in the money supply leads to an increase in interest rates, an increase in the demand for assets, and an increase in aggregate demand.\nThe table below shows the effects of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies on the economy.\nExpansionary fiscal policy | Expansionary monetary policy\nIncrease in the money supply | Increase in the money supply\nInterest rates increase | Interest rates increase\nDemand for assets increases | Demand for assets increases\nAggregate demand increases | Aggregate demand increases\nSOLUTION: When government spending increases, the demand for labor and capital increases. The demand for labor is represented by the investment demand curve. The elasticity of the investment demand curve determines the effect of an increase in government spending on the demand for labor and capital.\nIf the investment demand curve is elastic, the increase in government spending will lead to a decrease in the price of labor and capital.

The price has risen 20 percent.\nIf the price of a gallon of milk doubles, the price has risen 100 percent. The price change is 100 percent - 20 percent = 80 percent.\nAn 80 percent increase is larger than a 20 percent increase.\nSOLUTION: To determine the amount by which the CPI has risen, look at the difference between the new CPI and the old CPI.\nThe old CPI is 120, and the new CPI is 150. The difference is 150 - 120 = 30.\nThe CPI has risen 30 percent."}

When the government lowers taxes, it increases the disposable income of households. An increase in disposable income means that households have more money to spend or save.\nThe graph below shows the components of aggregate demand. The lines show the effect of an increase in disposable income on each component.\nWhen households have more disposable income, they will increase their spending on goods and services. This increase in consumption will lead to an increase in the quantity of goods and services demanded and an increase in real GDP.\nWhen households have more disposable income, they will have more money to save. An increase in savings will lead to an increase in investment as firms expand their operations to meet the increased demand for goods and services.\nA decrease in taxes also helps support higher levels of real GDP. Lower taxes leave more money in the hands of households and firms to spend or invest.\nA decrease in taxes does not necessarily increase unemployment. When unemployment is high, firms are able to find workers at the current wage. If wages remain unchanged, the supply of labor increases, and the equilibrium wage and employment level will decrease.

The curves show the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity that producers make and sell.\nThe curves are called aggregate supply and aggregate demand. Aggregate supply shows the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity that producers make and sell. The aggregate supply curve is determined by the prices of the inputs used to produce the good or service, and the number of producers and consumers in the market.\nThe curves meet at the point where the aggregate supply curve and the aggregate demand curve are both horizontal. This point is called the general price level. When the aggregate supply curve and the aggregate demand curve are both vertical, the economy is in crisis.\nSOLUTION: The diagram below shows how stagflation can be the result of a leftward shift in both the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves.\nWhen the price of a good or service rises, the quantity that consumers buy usually falls. This is because the good or service is now more expensive than it was before.\nWhen the quantity of a good or service that producers make and sell falls, the price of the good or service will usually rise. This is because there are now fewer goods or services for sale.\nSo, when both the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves shift leftward, the general price level will rise, and the quantity of goods and services sold will fall.

{"question": "If $100 of new autonomous private investment were added to an economy with a marginal propensity to consume of .90 by how much would aggregate demand shift to the right?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "$190 "}, {"label": "B", "text": "$900 "}, {"label": "C", "text": "$1,000 "}, {"label": "D", "text": "$1,900 "}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In the past, economies relied on farming, hunting, and gathering. In these economies, people produced their own food and other necessities.\nAs societies grew, specialized workers emerged. Some people became farmers. Others became hunters and gatherers. And others became craftspeople.\nThese specialized workers created goods and services that were sold in marketplaces. Money was used to simplify trade.\nThe table below shows how the money was used.\nType of good or service | Buyer | Seller\nFarm products | Farmers | Consumers\nCrafted items | Consumers | Craftspeople\nHunting and gathering | Hunters and gatherers | Consumers\nMoney has made trade easier. It has also made it possible for people to trade with people they have never met. This trading has created jobs and industries that specialize in producing goods and services for sale.\nSOLUTION: To determine how aggregate demand will shift to the right, look at the marginal propensity to consume.\nThe marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of each additional dollar of income that is spent. For example, if someone has a marginal propensity to consume of .90, then 90 cents of each additional dollar is spent, and 10 cents is saved.\nIf $100 of new autonomous private investment were added to an economy with a marginal propensity to consume of .90, the increase in investment would be used to pay for new capital. The owners of the capital would then use the capital to produce goods and services.\nBecause the marginal propensity to consume is .90, the new owners of the capital would spend 90 cents of each additional dollar they earn. So, the increase in investment would increase the demand for goods and services by 90 cents for each additional dollar spent.\nThere is a $100 increase in investment, so the increase in demand is $100.\nThe marginal propensity to consume is .90, so the change in demand is $100 \u00f7 $1.00 = 100.\nSo, the aggregate demand will shift to the right by $100."}

So, the domestic price of the good will rise to equal the world price.\nIf the world price of a good is lower than the domestic price of that good, people will buy the good from abroad and stop producing the good domestically. So, the domestic price of the good will fall to equal the world price.\nSOLUTION: With a higher world price than the domestic price, the United States will import copper from abroad and sell more domestic copper to foreign countries. The United States will not impose a tariff on imported copper to protect domestic producers, because the higher world price will lead to more domestic copper being sold.\nThe United States is not a net exporter of copper.\nThe demand for U.S. copper will rise, not fall.\nThe United States is running a trade deficit in goods and services. A trade deficit is when a country spends more on foreign goods and services than foreign countries spend on a country's goods and services."}

If the actual rate of growth is equal to the sustainable rate of growth, then there is no increase in the rates of investment or immigration.\nThe sustainable rate of growth is affected by the rates of investment and immigration. If the rates of investment or immigration increase, the sustainable rate of growth will increase. If the rates of investment or immigration decrease, the sustainable rate of growth will decrease.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the labor force increases the amount of labor that is available to produce goods and services. This increase in labor can increase the sustainable rate of growth. So, an increase in the labor force would increase economic growth."}

When the price level increases, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; this decrease in the purchasing power of money is inflation.\nInflation affects the economy in both positive and negative ways.\nOne way inflation can affect the economy is by encouraging households to save more. As prices rise, consumers expect that prices will continue to rise. So, they may choose to save their money, rather than spend it. This increase in saving leads to an increase in the supply of money available to lend.\nAnother way inflation can affect the economy is by discouraging savings. As prices rise, the value of money falls. So, individuals may choose to spend their money, rather than save it. This decrease in saving leads to a decrease in the supply of money available to lend.\nThe figure shows how inflation affects the trade-off between consumption and saving. As the price level rises, the trade-off moves in the direction of the higher price level."}

So, the value of the US dollar will decrease compared to the yen.\nThe decrease in the value of the US dollar compared to the yen will decrease the demand for US dollars in Japan. This happens because Japanese investors will now get more yen for each US dollar they sell.\nSo, the decrease in the exchange rate from 1 US dollar = 100 Japanese yen to 1 US dollar = 110 Japanese yen will decrease the demand for US dollars in Japan, decrease the value of the US dollar, and decrease exports of US goods and services to Japan."}

For example, an economy can produce either 50 cars or 100 bicycles, but not both. The curve that is created by this situation is a production possibility curve.\nA nation has an absolute advantage in producing a good if it can produce that good with fewer resources than are required to produce it in another nation. For example, a nation has an absolute advantage in producing cars because it can produce cars with fewer resources than are required to produce cars in another nation.\nA nation has a comparative advantage in producing a good if it can produce a different good with the same or fewer resources than are required to produce the first good. For example, a nation has a comparative advantage in producing bicycles because it can produce bicycles with the same number of resources used to produce cars.\nSOLUTION: Free trade allows each nation to specialize in producing the goods and services it has a comparative advantage in producing and then trade with other nations to produce the goods and services it has a comparative disadvantage in producing. This specialization and trade based on comparative advantage can result in an increase in the total amount of goods and services produced.\nWhen a nation specializes in producing the goods and services it has a comparative advantage in producing, it can consume beyond the production possibility curve. The curve of a nation's production possibilities is the sum of the production possibility curves for each good. So, if a nation can specialize in producing a good with a comparative advantage, it can consume beyond the production possibility curve for that good.\nNations can consume at points beyond the production possibility curve by protecting domestic industries from free trade. But, this protection comes at a cost. The cost of protecting domestic industries is the loss of consumer surplus from the higher prices of the protected goods and services."}

When the government spends more money than it takes in from taxes, it runs a budget deficit. When it takes in more money from taxes than it spends, it runs a budget surplus.\nFiscal policy can have a powerful effect on the economy. When the government runs a budget deficit, it can increase the money supply, which can lead to inflation. Inflation is a rise in the general price level of goods and services.\nWhen the government runs a budget surplus, it can decrease the money supply. This can help to decrease inflation. If inflation is too high, a budget surplus can help to bring it down. But if inflation is too low, a budget surplus can help to increase it.\nSOLUTION: To close an inflationary gap, the government can decrease the money supply, increase taxes, or reduce government spending.\nWhen the government increases taxes or reduces government spending, it decreases the money supply. This can help to close an inflationary gap.\nWhen the government decreases the money supply, it can help to keep the inflation rate low. If the inflation rate is too high, a decrease in the money supply can help to bring it down. But if the inflation rate is too low, a decrease in the money supply can help to increase it."}

When the government spends more money, it is increasing fiscal policy. When the government takes in more money, it is decreasing fiscal policy.\nMonetary policy involves the money supply. When the money supply increases, the value of each dollar goes down. This happens because there are more dollars being used to buy the same amount of goods and services. So, the price of goods and services goes down.\nSOLUTION: During the contractionary phase of the business cycle, the government should use expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to increase aggregate demand.\nAn increase in government spending and a decrease in the discount rate are both expansionary policies. An increase in government spending puts more money into the economy, and a decrease in the discount rate lowers the cost of borrowing money."}

When you use money as a medium of exchange, you can buy goods and services with it.\nA store of value is a tool that helps keep the value of your money the same over time. If the value of your money goes up, it is called inflation. When you use money as a store of value, you can spend it in the future.\nA unit of account is a standard measure of value. You can use a unit of account to compare the value of different goods and services. For example, the value of a hamburger is usually less than the value of a car.\nA transfer of ownership is a way to move money from one person or place to another person or place. When you use money as a transfer of ownership, you are moving it from the person who has it to the person who wants it.\nSOLUTION: The function of money as a medium of exchange shows how $1.25 is the price of a 20-ounce bottle of pop. The price tells you how much money you need to buy the bottle of pop."}

Some things are true about economies in general.\n1. Economies are based on trade. An economy is a system for producing and distributing goods and services. In any economy, people and companies produce goods and services. They then trade those goods and services for other goods and services.\n2. Trade requires exchange. To trade goods and services, people and companies must exchange them. To do this, they use money. Money is a medium of exchange. It allows people to buy and sell goods and services.\n3. There are many types of economies. An economy can be planned or market-based. In a planned economy, the government makes all the decisions about what is produced and how it is distributed. In a market-based economy, private companies make most of the decisions.\n4. Economies can be influenced by many things. For example, economies can be affected by population trends, government policies, and world events.\nSOLUTION: To close a recessionary gap, the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the right. This will increase the quantity of goods and services demanded.\nThe aggregate demand curve shows the quantity of goods and services that will be demanded at each price level. When prices are lower, the aggregate demand curve shifts to the left. This shows that the quantity of goods and services demanded has increased.\nWhen the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, the curve moves to a higher quantity of goods and services demanded. As a result of this increase in demand, the price level rises."}

So, the quantity of aggregate demand will decrease. The aggregate demand curve is shifted to the left, which means that the quantity of aggregate demand is less.\nSOLUTION: An increase in personal income tax rates will decrease the quantity of aggregate demand. People will have less income to spend, so the quantity of aggregate demand will decrease. The aggregate demand curve is shifted to the left, which means that the quantity of aggregate demand is less.\nAn increase in interest rates will also decrease the quantity of aggregate demand.

This is because the decrease in production would create a surplus of goods, lowering their price. And the decrease in imports would mean that fewer foreign goods were purchased, which would also lower the price level.\nBut today, many goods and services are no longer imported or exported. For many goods, the importer and exporter are the same company. So, a decrease in imports or an increase in exports will not necessarily decrease the price level.\nSOLUTION: When technology makes production less expensive, the cost of goods sold decreases. The production of goods and services is now less expensive than it was before. So, the price level will decrease."}

This deficit spending is part of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy can be used to help the economy grow.\nWhen the government spends more money, it helps to create jobs and increase incomes. This increase in income can increase consumer spending. When consumer spending increases, businesses will often expand production. This expansion is called crowding out.\nCrowding out happens when the extra spending by consumers and businesses offsets the effect of fiscal policy. For example, if the government spends more money on education, students will spend more on books. But the students' parents may spend less on other things. So, the increase in spending by one group is offset by the decrease in spending by another group."}

There are many different ways to measure the money supply. For example, M1 is the most common measure of the money supply. It includes all physical bills and coins, as well as some types of accounts that people use to make purchases.\nThe money supply of a country is an important number. It affects the interest rate and the value of the country's currency.\nThe Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, is responsible for controlling the money supply. It uses open market operations to do this. In an open market operation, the Federal Reserve buys or sells government securities. When the Federal Reserve buys securities, it pays with money it has created. This increase the money supply. When the Federal Reserve sells securities, it receives money it did not have before. This decreases the money supply.\nSOLUTION: To determine the change in the money supply, look at the transaction. The Federal Reserve sold $10 million worth of government securities. So, the money supply decreased by $10 million."}

The equation is as follows:\nM \u00b7 V = P \u00b7 Q\nThe money supply (M) is the total amount of money in circulation. The velocity of money (V) is the rate at which people are spending the money. The price level (P) is the average price for all goods and services in an economy. The quantity of goods and services (Q) is the total amount of goods and services produced and sold.\nThe equation tells you that the price level depends on the money supply and the velocity of money. The quantity of goods and services is on both sides of the equation, so it cancels out.\nHow do changes in the money supply and the velocity of money affect the price level?\nAn increase in the money supply or a decrease in the velocity of money will both cause the price level to rise.\nAn increase in the money supply makes it easier for people to buy goods and services. When people have more money, they buy more goods and services. The extra buying causes the prices to go up.\nA decrease in the velocity of money means that people are exchanging the same money for more goods and services. This also causes the prices to go up.\nSOLUTION: Look at the equation of exchange:\nM \u00b7 V = P \u00b7 Q\nYou can see that the price level (P) is equal to the money supply (M) times the velocity of money (V). So, P stands for the price level and V stands for the velocity of money."}

This decrease in price, or decrease in the currency's exchange rate, makes the currency less expensive relative to other currencies.\nSo, if the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar increases relative to the Chinese yuan, the price of goods and services in U.S. dollars will decrease relative to the price of goods and services in Chinese yuan. This will make U.S. exports more competitive in China, and Chinese exports more competitive in the United States.\nThe opposite is true when the exchange rate for a currency decreases. The price of goods and services in that currency increases relative to other currencies. This increase in price, or increase in the currency's exchange rate, makes the currency more expensive relative to other currencies.\nSo, if the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar decreases relative to the Chinese yuan, the price of goods and services in U.S. dollars will increase relative to the price of goods and services in Chinese yuan. This will make Chinese exports more competitive in the United States, and U.S. exports more competitive in China.\nSOLUTION: An appreciation of the dollar relative to the Chinese yuan means that the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar has increased relative to the Chinese yuan.\nThis could happen when there is a lower price level in China relative to the United States. The exchange rate for a currency is determined by the market for that currency.
