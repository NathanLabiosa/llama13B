The Security Council has 15 members, and each member has one vote. The President of the Security Council is elected for a one-month term. The Security Council meets continuously and is not subject to adjournment.\nThe Security Council has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. It can investigate any situation it deems likely to impair the general peace and security of the world. The council may recommend that members try to reach a settlement on a dispute. If that is not possible, the council may propose measures to prevent hostilities or to stop them.\nThe Security Council can establish peacekeeping operations to help end a conflict. The council can also impose sanctions on a country or group to get them to comply with a council resolution.\nThe Security Council can take action against threats to peace and security. It can do this by imposing diplomatic, economic, or military measures on a country or group.\nThe five permanent members of the Security Council are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These five countries have veto power. This means that a resolution cannot pass if any of these countries does not agree to it. The 10 rotating members of the Security Council are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms."}

United States President George W. Bush has defended his country's unilateralism by arguing that the United States has a responsibility to use its power to promote freedom and security.\nHowever, unilateralism has its risks. For example, the United States has found itself increasingly isolated in its foreign policies, as other countries have tried to counterbalance its power. In addition, the United States has had to take on a larger role in maintaining global security, as other countries have reduced their military spending and their commitments to international security.\nSOLUTION: World War I marked the beginning of the United States' rise to global economic dominance. The war helped to build the United States' economy:\nThe war boosted American industry, as the United States supplied both the Allied and Central powers with war materials.\nThe war sparked a wave of innovation in the United States, as scientists and businesses worked to develop new technologies to support the war effort.\nAfter the war, the United States emerged as the world's leading creditor, as European countries sought to rebuild their economies."}

According to this view, a state's foreign policy is determined by the interactions and counter-interactions between a state and other states.\nA systemic theory of international relations emphasizes the following:\nThe international system is a complex and dynamic system. It is complex because it is made up of many different states, each with its own government and society. It is dynamic because the interactions and counter-interactions between states change over time.\nThe character of the international system affects the foreign policies of states in three ways. First, the number of other states in the system affects the degree of competition among them. A state with many competitors is in a more competitive system than a state with few competitors. Second, the distribution of power among states in the system affects the degree of conflict among them. A state with less power than others is in a more conflictive system than a state with more power. Third, the degree of conflict among states in the system affects the security of each state. A state in a more conflictive system is less secure than a state in a less conflictive system.\nA state's place within the international system determines the foreign policies of states in two ways. First, a state's position in the system affects its role in the system. A state that is a dominant military power in the system may have a different role than a state that is a medium-sized power. Second, a state's position in the system affects its interactions with other states. A state that is a neighbor of several other states has different interactions than a state that is far from other states.\nA state's political ideology affects its foreign policy, but this is not the primary determinant of a state's foreign policy. A state's political ideology tells a state what it wants in the international system. A state's foreign policy tells a state what it does to get what it wants. A state's foreign policy is affected more by a state's place in the international system and the interactions with other states than by a state's political ideology.\nThe character of a state's leader does not affect a state's foreign policy to the same degree that a state's place in the international system and the interactions with other states do. A state's leader tells a state what it wants. But a state's foreign policy tells a state what it does to get what it wants."}

Some states may deny or conceal their nuclear programs to avoid international pressure or to use their programs as a bargaining chip.\nIf leaders revealed their programs, they would be more likely to be attacked. States may keep their nuclear programs secret to avoid becoming targets of military attack.\nLeaders will not always grant foreign monitors access to their nuclear programs. The ability to monitor a state's nuclear program is important for verifying compliance with nonproliferation agreements. However, some states may restrict access to their facilities as a matter of national security.\nSOLUTION: All of the above."}

In 19th century China, the emperor was the only one allowed to do business with foreigners.\nSo, when the Opium War began in 1839, the emperor was not expecting to have to deal with the Western powers. The Qing dynasty had ruled China since 1644. The Opium War was a turning point in Chinese history.

{"question": "International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Irrationality on the part of the leadership"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Regime type"}, {"label": "D", "text": "International conflict prevents trade"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: International trade is the exchange of goods and services between countries. Like any other activity, trade involves both costs and benefits.\nThe benefits of international trade include:\nMore choices: Trade allows countries to specialize in producing goods and services that they can produce most efficiently. This specialization leads to lower costs and higher quality.\nBetter use of resources: Trade allows countries to use their resources more efficiently. For example, a country with plenty of oil may specialize in oil production and import goods that require other resources.\nIncreased economic growth: Trade can lead to increased economic growth. As countries specialize in producing goods and services that they can produce most efficiently, they can use their resources more effectively.\nHigher incomes: Trade can raise incomes in a country. When a country trades with other countries, it has access to a larger market. This allows the country to specialize in producing goods and services that are in high demand. This specialization can lead to higher incomes.\nThe costs of international trade include:\nJob losses: Some jobs are lost when a country specializes in producing goods and services that it can produce most efficiently. Factory workers in one country may lose their jobs when a factory is shut down and moved to a country where labor is cheaper.\nLower wages: Trade can also lead to lower wages in a country. When a country trades with other countries, it has access to a larger labor pool. This can lead to lower wages as employers can now choose from a larger pool of workers.\nEnvironmental damage: Some types of trade can lead to environmental damage. This is because some countries may be more willing to destroy their environment in order to produce goods and services more cheaply.\nWar: International conflict can prevent trade. For example, if one country is at war with another country, they cannot trade with each other.\nSOLUTION: Countries trade with each other for the same reason that individuals trade with each other. Each country has a comparative advantage in producing some goods and services, and can trade with other countries to produce those goods and services.\nThe costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed. This means that the costs of trade are focused on a few people in a country. The benefits of trade are spread throughout the country. This can make it difficult for people to understand that the benefits of trade are greater than the costs."}

One of the major developments of this period was the Truman Doctrine, which was announced by President Harry S. Truman in 1947. The doctrine marked a significant turn in American foreign policy.\nThe significance of the Truman Doctrine was that it indicated a change in American foreign policy. Up to this point, the United States had been reluctant to involve itself in the conflicts and problems of other countries. The Truman Doctrine, however, indicated a new willingness to do so.\nThe doctrine was the first statement on European affairs by the Truman administration.

You can think about it in terms of economics, politics, or culture.\nEconomic globalization involves the flow of goods, services, and capital across national borders. As economic globalization has increased, the world's trade has grown. This trend has led to the rise of global corporations and the spread of international brands.\nPolitical globalization refers to the growing interdependence of different countries' governments. Some issues, such as climate change, affect many countries and require international cooperation.\nCultural globalization refers to the spread of ideas, customs, and behavior across national borders.

At first, US expansion was driven by the desire to expand markets. By the late 1800s, US entrepreneurs had created the most powerful economy in the world. US businesses needed more land to expand into if they were to keep growing.\nThe US government had several reasons to annex new territory. One was to create new markets for US goods. As the economy continued to grow, US businesses needed even larger markets. Annexing new territory would give US businesses access to more customers.\nAnother reason was to ensure a steady supply of raw materials. Many US businesses needed raw materials to make their products. Annexing new territory would give them access to more raw materials.\nThe United States did not begin to limit its expansion to Latin America until after 1865.\nSOLUTION: The key difference between US expansion pre- and post-1865 was that US expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865.\nBefore 1865, US expansion was driven by the desire to expand markets. But the markets in North America had been exhausted by the late 1800s. So, the United States began to look to other places, such as Latin America, for new markets."}

One way people can do this is by joining a labor union.\nA labor union is an organization that represents workers. A union gives workers a collective voice in the workplace. Unions negotiate with employers to improve wages, benefits, and working conditions.\nDoes a union have the right to exist?\nYes. In the United States, workers have the right to form unions and to bargain with their employers. This right is in the National Labor Relations Act, which was passed in 1935. The act says that workers who are covered by the act have the right to form unions and to bargain with their employers.\nThe act covers most private-sector employees, but it does not cover many types of workers, such as independent contractors, agricultural workers, and domestic workers.\nWhat is a union's purpose?\nA union's purpose is to negotiate with employers on behalf of workers. Unions want to improve the pay, benefits, and working conditions of their members.\nHow does a union negotiate with an employer?\nA union negotiates with an employer by making demands and proposals for how the workers should be treated. The union may want to negotiate for higher wages, better benefits, or a shorter workweek, for example.\nThe union and the employer will often meet and talk about these demands. If the two sides can agree on the terms of a contract, they will sign a document called a collective bargaining agreement. This agreement will set the terms and conditions of employment for the union's members."}

One approach was a strong national defense and a willingness to use military force when necessary. The other approach was a belief that the United States could work with other countries to reduce international tensions and promote world peace.\nD\u00e9tente was a major part of this second approach. D\u00e9tente is a French word that means \"a easing of tensions.\" During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union concluded that they should try to reduce the tensions between them. This reduced the threat of nuclear war. The two countries worked together on a number of issues, such as arms control.\nNuclear disarmament was a part of the first approach. President Reagan wanted to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world. He believed that reducing the number of nuclear weapons would make the world a safer place.\nAnticommunism was a part of Reagan's second approach. Reagan believed that communism was an evil ideology that was a threat to the United States and its allies. However, he also believed that the United States did not have to be afraid of the Soviet Union.\nInternational free trade was not a major part of Reagan's policies.

Many people opposed the war, believing that it was not worth fighting and that the United States should not be involved. Other people, however, believed that the war was a necessary part of the struggle against communism.\nThe Vietnam War was also an example of the doctrine of containment, because U.S. involvement was designed to prevent the fall of South Vietnam to the communists. The containment policy was a central part of U.S. foreign policy after World War II. The Truman and Eisenhower administrations believed that the spread of communism to other countries would undermine world security. The communist leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, had died in 1953, and many Americans hoped that the new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, would be more reasonable about the Cold War. But Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders were just as committed to the spread of communism as Stalin had been.\nIn the late 1960s, the United States had 536,000 soldiers in Vietnam. The United States had been involved in Vietnam for over a decade, but the war was not going well. Many American soldiers and civilians were becoming disillusioned with the war. College students in particular were becoming more antiwar.\nIn 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson had agreed to a proposal by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to send more troops to Vietnam. But by 1969, many Americans were questioning the war. The questioning was fueled in part by the media, which had grown more critical of the war as the years went by.\nSOLUTION: The Vietnam War can be understood as an example of how even a great power may not be able to prevail against a determined enemy unless there is a clear objective and the national will to do so. For years, the United States had tried to do what it could to help South Vietnam survive. But in 1975, North Vietnam was finally able to conquer South Vietnam. The war had lasted for more than a decade and a half.\nThe Vietnam War was also an example of the doctrine of containment, because U.S. involvement was designed to prevent the fall of South Vietnam to the communists.\nThe Vietnam War can also be understood as a war that deeply divided the United States and fostered cynicism toward the American government. Many people in the United States had opposite views about the war, and the war was a major issue in the 1960s and 1970s."}

The plan was named after U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall. The Marshall Plan included aid for the reconstruction of European industries and infrastructure and helped to spur economic growth in Europe.

In a democratic society, bureaucrats make decisions about how to spend funds and what policies to pursue. In doing so, they may face difficult choices. For example, consider a bureaucrat who must decide how to allocate funds for disaster relief. The bureaucrat may have to choose between helping victims of one disaster and helping victims of another disaster.\nOne way to make this decision is to consider the interests of those who make up each group of victims. For example, the bureaucrat might consider the number of people hurt in each disaster, the severity of their injuries, and whether they have received assistance.\nAnother way to make this decision is to consider the bureaucrat's own goals. For example, the bureaucrat might want to allocate funds to help victims in a particular geographic area, or to allocate funds to help victims of a particular type of disaster.\nBoth of these ways of making the decision are examples of bureaucratic politics.\nSOLUTION: The passage suggests that bureaucratic politics does not provide information about how nuclear weapons are identified and responded to; who controls the weapons, and so the answer is D."}

Similarly, few people today can predict what new technologies and industries will emerge in the coming years. But there are a few trends that are likely to continue in the coming decades.\nOne trend is that the world's economies will become more interconnected. This trend is illustrated by the growth of multinational corporations and the increasing number of joint ventures between companies from different countries. As a result of these trends, many businesses are becoming more globally oriented, which means that they are dependent on global trade and investment.\nAnother trend is that the world will have to deal with an increasingly urbanized population. For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. This trend is driven by migration to cities and the trend toward smaller families. An urbanized population presents many challenges, including poverty, pollution, and access to resources.\nA third trend is that the world will have to deal with the long-term effects of climate change. Climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil. The United States is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. As the world struggles to deal with the effects of climate change, the United States will need to consider its role in contributing to the problem and its role in finding solutions.\nSOLUTION: The United States has been a global leader in oil production for much of the past century. This has meant that the United States has had a great deal of influence in the world, based on its ability to control the flow of oil. In recent years, however, the United States has become more dependent on oil from other countries. This is a problem because it leaves the United States more vulnerable to interruptions in the supply of oil.\nIn order to reduce its dependence on oil from other countries, the United States has tried to find new sources of oil at home.

The theory was also used to explain the need for military intervention in the Cuban Missile Crisis.\nThe Domino Theory was based on the idea that communism would spread from one country to another, like dominoes falling in a line. This theory was considered a serious threat to national security during the Cold War.\nSOLUTION: The Domino Theory was the idea that the fall of one state to communism would inexorably lead to the fall of its neighbors. This theory was based on the idea that communism would spread from one country to another, like dominoes falling in a line."}

There is little evidence that international aid has a significant impact on the target states' policies, although it may help to alleviate some of the immediate pressures leading to crisis situations.\nSOLUTION: Conditional programs, such as the Millennium Challenge, that require change before receipt of aid, have been an effective way of disbursing US foreign aid to encourage change in target states. Such programs can be designed to encourage policy changes that benefit the United States.\nThe use of intergovernmental organizations to monitor aid disbursement has not been an effective way of disbursing US foreign aid to encourage change in target states. Intergovernmental organizations are often slow to respond to crises and may not have the resources to effectively monitor aid disbursements.\nWithdrawal of aid for bad policies has not been an effective way of disbursing US foreign aid to encourage change in target states. Such a policy can lead to a loss of leverage and can result in the target state turning to another aid donor."}

Nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945, and many states have acquired them without using them. But some states have used nuclear weapons, so their possession of these weapons is a cause for concern.\nSome predictors of whether a state will acquire nuclear weapons are:\nBeing a nuclear state itself: So far, only states that have already acquired nuclear weapons have done so.\nHaving a rivalry with a nuclear state: Many of the states that have acquired nuclear weapons have done so in response to a rival state's acquisition of nuclear weapons.\nHaving a conflict with a nuclear state: Some conflicts have escalated to the use of nuclear weapons.\nHaving a strong military: A strong military can help a state acquire nuclear weapons.\nHaving a dictatorship or authoritarian regime: Some of the states that have acquired nuclear weapons have done so under such regimes.\nHaving a history of proliferation: Some states have proliferated WMD (weapons of mass destruction: nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons).\nHaving a wealth of resources: A state with natural resources may use them to fund the acquisition of nuclear weapons.\nHaving an advanced technology industry: An advanced technology industry can help a state acquire nuclear weapons.\nSOLUTION: Rivalry with a nuclear state is not a good predictor of whether a state will get nuclear weapons. Some states with no rival nuclear states have acquired nuclear weapons, and some states with rival nuclear states have not."}

There are many ways in which imperialism can be practiced, and it has been practiced in many different forms.\nOne way that imperialism can be practiced is through cultural imperialism. Cultural imperialism is the promotion of a culture by a more powerful country or culture. This can be done by disseminating a country's culture, or by allowing a country to dominate the cultural development of another country.\nAnother way that imperialism can be practiced is through economic imperialism. Economic imperialism is the practice of a more powerful country supplanting the economy of a less powerful country. This can be done by a country importing more goods from its own companies to a weaker country, or by a country lending money to a weaker country in such a way that the weaker country is able to pay off the debt by accepting the more powerful country's terms for its economy.\nA third way that imperialism can be practiced is through political imperialism. Political imperialism is the practice of a more powerful country exerting its influence over the political development of a less powerful country. This can be done by a country overthrowing the government of a weaker country, or by a country trying to get a weaker country to change its government.\nImperialism by invitation is a form of indirect imperialism. In this form of imperialism, a weaker country invites a more powerful country to come in and use its influence in the weaker country. This type of imperialism can occur when a country is in crisis, and it is looking for any country to help it restore stability.\nSOLUTION: The term empire by invitation refers to a country's voluntary reliance on an external power for security. A country may invite an external power to come in and use its influence in the country. This is a form of indirect imperialism."}

This idea was not a part of the country's early foreign policy.\nThe idea of avoiding entangling alliances was first stated by Thomas Jefferson in 1785. In a letter to William S. Smith, Jefferson wrote: \"I deplore the folly and wickedness of those governments which make themselves the accompaniment of the carnage they may encourage.\"\nJames Monroe expressed a similar sentiment in 1796. As the United States' first ambassador to France, Monroe wrote to Jefferson of his hope that the United States would remain neutral in future European wars.\nJohn Quincy Adams expressed the same idea in 1799. As a diplomat in Europe, Adams had learned the dangers of partisanship in other countries' affairs. Adams wrote to his father, \"She [the United States] should not be entangled in European politics, and in the wars and revolutions which may affect the Continent.\"\nIn 1823, President James Madison bought the Louisiana Territory from France. This territory consisted of land from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border. Many Americans feared that France might regain control of the territory, and they urged the United States to acquire a strong army and navy. President Madison, however, famously proclaimed, \"We are the only people to whom the God of nature has given a dominion over a continent.\" Instead of building up the military, Madison pursued a policy of conquest and expansion. This policy outraged many Americans, who feared that it would lead to war and entangling alliances with European powers.\nWoodrow Wilson also spoke against entangling alliances. In 1917, as the United States geared up to join World War I, Wilson declared, \"We want no part of any system of alliances that may embroil us in the quarrels of Europe.\"\nAbraham Lincoln spoke against intervention in other countries' affairs. In 1861, in his first inaugural address, Lincoln proposed to avoid entangling alliances: \"I am loth to close my lips on this topic without addressing to you a few words of warning. The civil war now pending in the Republic of Mexico is a matter of woe and ruin to that country, and in the end will be of harm also to the United States. It is a war between different nations and races, waged by the strong against the weak. It should be avoided by the United States.\""}
