The 'Great Migration' of 1916-1919 was a period of mass migration of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North, particularly to cities such as Chicago. This migration was driven by a range of factors, including the desire for better job opportunities, the hope of escaping racial discrimination and violence in the South, and the lure of the 'American Dream'. The result of this migration was a significant increase in the number of African Americans living in the city, particularly in the South Side of Chicago. However, the black population was not integrated into mainstream society in the same way as other ethnic groups. Instead, they were segregated into ghettos, where they faced discrimination and prejudice from the white host population. This was a consequence of the 'Great Migration' and was not a result of assimilation or multiculturalism.\n11. 11 \u200b(B) multiculturalism: all ethnic identities were celebrated equally\u200b The correct answer is \u200b(B)"}
