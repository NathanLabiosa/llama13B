This is because the Federal Reserve will increase the federal funds rate to reduce the money supply and combat inflation. As interest rates increase, the demand for money will decrease, which will lead to a decrease in the money supply. This will cause the price level to decrease, which will lead to a decrease in inflation.\nThe increase in interest rates will also have an impact on the international value of the dollar. When interest rates increase, the dollar will become more attractive to foreign investors. This is because the higher interest rates in the United States will make it more profitable to invest in the United States. As a result, the demand for the dollar will increase, which will lead to an appreciation of the dollar's value.\nIn summary, the Federal Reserve's contractionary fiscal policy is likely to affect domestic interest rates and the international value of the dollar.

One way is through its effect on interest rates. When the money supply increases, interest rates tend to fall, which can stimulate spending and investment. On the other hand, when the money supply decreases, interest rates tend to rise, which can dampen spending and investment.\nAnother way that a change in the money supply can affect the economy is through its impact on inflation. When the money supply increases, there is more money chasing the same amount of goods and services, which can lead to inflation. This can lead to higher prices and lower purchasing power.\nFinally, a change in the money supply can affect the economy through its impact on the exchange rate. When the money supply increases, the value of the currency may fall, which can make exports more competitive and imports more expensive.

The standard of living is a measure of the level of economic well-being of a country's citizens. It is typically measured by the average level of real GDP per capita, which is the total output of goods and services produced by a country divided by its population. In this case, real GDP per capita increased from $20000 in 1980 to $21000 in 1990, which represents an increase of 5.0 percent. However, to calculate the percentage increase in the standard of living, we need to adjust for inflation. The increase in real GDP per capita can be converted to a constant dollar value by adjusting for inflation using the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services that a typical consumer would purchase. To convert the real GDP per capita to a constant dollar value, we can multiply it by the ratio of the CPI in 1990 to the CPI in 1980.

This is the increase in the consumption expenditure of the residents of England, which is part of the GDP. The total increase in England's real GDP is the sum of this increase in consumption expenditure and the increase in the production of goods and services in England. The increase in production is the difference between the total output of goods and services in England and the cost of producing them.

The short-run Phillips curve shows the relationship between inflation and unemployment in the short run, while the long-run Phillips curve shows the relationship between inflation and unemployment in the long run. In the short run, there is a positive relationship between inflation and unemployment, meaning that as inflation increases, unemployment tends to decrease. In the long run, the relationship between inflation and unemployment is negative, meaning that as inflation increases, unemployment tends to increase.

The federal government usually experiences a budget surplus during economic recession and a budget deficit during economic expansion.\nExplanation: The federal government usually experiences a budget deficit during economic recession and a budget surplus during economic expansion. This is because during economic recession, government spending on unemployment benefits, infrastructure projects, and other stimulus measures increases, while tax revenue decreases due to lower economic activity. As a result, the government has to borrow money to finance the budget deficit. During economic expansion, government spending on social programs, defense, and other items decreases, while tax revenue increases due to higher economic activity. This leads to a budget surplus.\n11. Which of the following is not a characteristic of a government budget?\nA."}
