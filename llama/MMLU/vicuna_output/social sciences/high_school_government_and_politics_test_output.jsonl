(A) The preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act is the least likely to explain low voter turnout for an election. The preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act requires certain states and localities with a history of racial discrimination in voting to obtain federal approval before making any changes to their voting laws or procedures. This provision has been successful in preventing discrimination against minority voters and has helped to increase voter turnout in these areas. However, it is not likely to be the cause of low voter turnout in areas where there is no history of discrimination. 2. (B) Low levels of political efficacy among registered voters is a possible explanation for low voter turnout. Political efficacy refers to an individual's belief in their ability to make a difference through political participation. If registered voters do not believe that their vote will make a difference, they may be less likely to vote. 3. (C) Regulations that require voters to show identification are also a possible explanation for low voter turnout.
