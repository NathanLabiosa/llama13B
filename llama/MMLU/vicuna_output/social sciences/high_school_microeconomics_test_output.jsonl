A rival firm matches price increases of rivals, but fails to match any price decrease of rivals.\nC. A rival firm fails to match both price increases or price decreases of rivals.\nD. Rival firms act independently of each other.\nExplanation: Oligopoly is a market structure in which a few firms dominate the market and have significant market power. In an oligopoly, firms are aware of each other's actions and strategies, and they try to outdo each other to gain market share.\nIn an oligopoly, firms are likely to match each other's price changes, as they are aware of each other's strategies. Therefore, the correct answer is 1, which states that a rival firm matches price decreases of rivals, but fails to match any price increases of rivals.\n1. MBA 601 - Microeconomics, Fall 2019\n2.

In the case of coffee, a price floor would be a legal maximum price that coffee farmers could charge for their coffee beans.\nWhen a price floor is installed in a market, it can have several effects on the market. One effect is that it can increase consumer surplus, which is the difference between the price that consumers are willing to pay for a good and the price they actually pay. This is because a price floor sets a minimum price that consumers must pay for the good, which means that they will pay less than they would have otherwise.\nTherefore, the correct answer is \u200b(C) an increase in consumer surplus due to lower coffee prices.\n11.

P =MR.\nExplanation: Monopolistic competition is a type of market structure in which there are many firms producing similar but not identical products. In this type of market, firms have some degree of market power, but it is not as strong as in a monopoly. The price of a product in monopolistic competition is determined by the marginal revenue curve, which is the same as the demand curve. The marginal revenue curve shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product that can be sold. In monopolistic competition, the marginal revenue curve is downward sloping, which means that as the price of a product increases, the quantity of the product that can be sold decreases. Therefore, the price of a product in monopolistic competition is equal to the marginal revenue curve, which is the same as the demand curve.\n10. MC 4."}

It is often used to protect the interests of producers or to ensure that consumers have access to essential goods at affordable prices.\nWhen a price floor is set, it creates a surplus of the good. This is because the price floor is higher than the market price, and producers are unable to sell all of their goods at the floor price. As a result, there is a surplus of the good on the market.\nA persistent shortage of the good occurs when the price floor is set too high, and producers are unable to meet the demand for the good. This can lead to a situation where consumers are unable to purchase the good, even if they are willing to pay the market price.\nIn summary, a price floor can lead to a persistent shortage of the good if it is set too high.

A firm's marginal cost curve is a graphical representation of the marginal cost of producing one more unit of output. The marginal cost curve is typically upward-sloping because as the firm produces more units, the marginal cost of producing each additional unit increases. The marginal cost curve is also typically different from the average total cost curve because the marginal cost curve reflects the firm's variable costs, while the average total cost curve reflects both the firm's variable and fixed costs. The marginal cost curve is important because it helps a firm determine the optimal level of production and price. If the marginal cost curve is above the market price, the firm can increase its profit by producing and selling more units. If the marginal cost curve is below the market price, the firm can increase its profit by reducing its production and selling fewer units. The marginal cost curve is also important for understanding the firm's pricing strategy.

This is because a price ceiling reduces the profitability of producing and selling good X, which may lead to a decrease in the supply of good X. As a result, the price of good X increases, making it less attractive to consumers who are willing to pay less for good X. At the same time, the price ceiling increases the profitability of producing and selling good Z, which is a complement with good X.

It is often used by governments to control the prices of goods and services that are considered essential or necessary for the public good, such as healthcare or utilities.\nA price ceiling will have no effect on the quantity of the good supplied because it does not change the equilibrium price or the equilibrium quantity. The equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. A price ceiling simply sets a maximum price that can be charged, but it does not change the equilibrium price or the equilibrium quantity.
