The standard deviation of the portfolio is the sum of the standard deviations of the two stocks minus the product of the standard deviations and the correlation coefficient. The standard deviation of Stock A is 6% and the standard deviation of Stock B is 18%. The correlation coefficient between the two stocks is 0.2. The standard deviation of the portfolio is given by the formula: \u03c3p = 6% + 18% - 2(0.2)(6%)(18%) = 3.40%. Answer: B. 5%. 10. MBA601 Managerial Finance Quiz 10.

They are also called stocks. Bonds, on the other hand, are debt securities that represent a loan to the company. The company agrees to pay the bondholder a fixed amount of interest (coupons) and repay the principal amount borrowed at maturity.\nIn contrast to bonds, equity securities do not have a fixed coupon payment. Instead, the company's profits are distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends. Dividends are paid after corporation tax has been deducted, so the shareholder receives a net amount after tax.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Their payouts (i.e. dividend or coupons) are made after corporation tax has already been deducted.\n1.
