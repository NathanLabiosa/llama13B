Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle? Answer: G2. The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle. The mutation in the p53 gene in this case leads to an inactive gene product, which would result in a defect in cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase. The G2 phase is the final phase of the cell cycle, where the chromosomes are replicated and the cell prepares for mitosis. The inability to arrest in G2 would lead to an accumulation of cells in the G2 phase, which could result in the observed tumor growth despite radiation therapy.\n11. A 57-"}

He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m2 .
