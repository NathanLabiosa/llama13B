The probability of carrying one specific allele is 0.2, so the probability of carrying both specific alleles is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04.\nThe likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles is the product of the probability of carrying one specific allele and the probability of carrying the other specific allele.

This protein is involved in the regulation of bone growth and development, and mutations in the FGFR3 gene result in the production of a non-functional protein that leads to the characteristic features of achondroplasia, including short stature, short limbs, and a large head.\nThe other options are not correct. Dominant negative mutations do not cause achondroplasia, as they would result in the production of a dominant negative protein that would interfere with the function of the normal protein. Gain-of-function mutations would result in the production of an excessive amount of the FGFR3 protein, which would lead to overgrowth rather than the short stature and other features of achondroplasia.
