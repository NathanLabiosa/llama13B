Lactate is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, and when it accumulates in the muscles, it can cause muscle fatigue and decreased performance. To prevent this, the body can use lactate as a fuel source in other tissues, such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. The liver can also convert lactate to glucose, which can be used as a fuel source by other tissues. The kidneys can also excrete lactate in the urine.\n11. \u200bQuiz 11: Cardiovascular System\u200b\n1. \u200bThe main function of the heart is to:\nA) pump blood throughout the body\nB) regulate body temperature\nC) store blood\nD) produce hormones\nThe correct answer is \u200bA\u200b.\nThe main function of the heart is to pump blood throughout the body.
