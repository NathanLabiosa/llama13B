Lysosomes and endosomes are two different types of organelles that are involved in different cellular processes. Lysosomes are small, acidic organelles that contain enzymes that break down organic molecules, while endosomes are small, membrane-bound vesicles that play a role in endocytosis and the transport of molecules within the cell. Centrifugation can be used to separate these two types of organelles by using different centrifugation speeds to separate them based on their density.\n11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11. 11."}

In the lungs, oxygen diffuses from the air in the alveoli into the blood in the pulmonary capillaries. The partial pressure gradient of the gas is the difference in pressure between the alveoli and the capillary. If the partial pressure gradient is decreased, the rate of diffusion will also be decreased.\n11.

The symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem is through the sieve tubes. The sieve tubes are the specialized cells that conduct the phloem transport. The phloem parenchyma cells are the supporting cells that surround the sieve tubes and provide support and protection. The companion cells are the specialized cells that surround the phloem parenchyma cells and provide them with nutrients. The fibers are the specialized cells that conduct the xylem transport.
