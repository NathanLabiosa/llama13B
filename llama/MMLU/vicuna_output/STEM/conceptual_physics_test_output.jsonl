Since the mass of an object does not change during free fall, the acceleration of free fall is the same for all masses.\n1.

(B) Energy is always conserved in a closed system. (C) Energy is always conserved in an open system. (D) Energy is not conserved in a system that is not isolated. The correct answer is 1.\nEnergy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.\nThe law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This means that the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant over time. In an open system, energy can be added or removed, but the total amount of energy remains constant.\n1.

It is defined as the ratio of the proper time to the coordinate time, and is given by the equation:\nt = \u03b3t'\nwhere t is the proper time of the object, t' is the coordinate time of the observer, and \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor:\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\nwhere v is the velocity of the object relative to the observer.\nThe Lorentz factor is a measure of the time dilation experienced by an object as it moves through space. When an object moves at a high velocity relative to an observer, time appears to pass more slowly for the object than for the observer. This is because time dilation is a consequence of the Lorentz transformation, which relates the proper time and coordinate time of an object as it moves through space.\nThe Lorentz factor is a fundamental concept in special relativity, and is used to calculate the time dilation experienced by an object as it moves through"}
