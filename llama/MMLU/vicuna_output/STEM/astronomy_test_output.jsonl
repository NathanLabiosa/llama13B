He found that the shadow was shorter in Alexandria than in Syene, which indicated that the distance between the two locations was not equal to the distance around the Earth.

This is because the temperature and pressure at which a substance becomes a gas (its boiling point) is directly related to its density. The higher the temperature, the lower the density.

The greenhouse effect works by trapping heat from the sun in the Earth's atmosphere. The greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, absorb the infrared radiation that is emitted by the Earth's surface and trap it in the atmosphere. This trapped heat then warms the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is essential for life on Earth, as it helps to maintain a stable temperature and climate. However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to a warming of the Earth's surface. This is known as global warming.\n### 11. \u200b\n### 12. \u200b\n### 13. \u200b\n### 14. \u200b\n### 15. \u200b\n"}

He knew the distance between the two cities and the angle of the Sun's altitude at noon at the latitude of one of the cities. He then used the principles of geometry to calculate the angle of the Sun's altitude at noon at the latitude of the other city. By comparing the two angles, he could determine the size of the Earth's circumference.

Kirkwood gaps are regions in the asteroid belt where the gravitational influence of Jupiter causes asteroids to be deflected into more eccentric orbits, causing them to collide with other asteroids or with the planet itself. The gaps are named after the American astronomer Simon Newcomb, who first predicted their existence in 1866. The Kirkwood gaps are located at specific orbital distances where the gravitational influence of Jupiter is at a minimum. The gaps are located at the 3:1, 5:2, 7:3, 2:1, and 5:1 mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. The Kirkwood gaps are not located at the 2:1 or 1:1 resonances, where the gravitational influence of Jupiter is at a maximum and asteroids are most likely to be captured into stable orbits.\n11. 11 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1"}

The Earth's atmosphere is made up of a mixture of gases, including some that trap heat and keep the planet warm. These gases are called greenhouse gases. They include things like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. When sunlight hits the Earth, some of the light is absorbed by the Earth's surface. The rest of the light passes through the atmosphere and is absorbed by the greenhouse gases. The greenhouse gases then re-emit the absorbed heat as infrared radiation, which is trapped by the Earth's surface, causing it to warm up.
