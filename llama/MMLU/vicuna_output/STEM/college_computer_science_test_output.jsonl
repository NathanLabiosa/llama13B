This is because the address of the variable's component values can be changed without changing the code that uses the variable, as long as the new address is within the same memory block. In contrast, direct representation requires recompilation of all source modules that use the variable, since the component values must be reloaded into the new storage location.\nTherefore, the statement that is true about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is that indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed when the storage size of a variable changes.\n10.

This means that there is a path from u to v that is not in T. Since T is a tree, this path must contain a cycle.\nNow, consider the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T. Since u and v are not in the same level in T, the lowest common ancestor must be a vertex that is an ancestor of both u and v. However, since the path from u to v is not in T, the lowest common ancestor cannot be u or v.

The total time required for the compilation on the diskless workstation is 30 seconds + 200 file page accesses \\* 0.1 seconds/page = 30 seconds + 200 \\* 0.1 seconds/page = 30 seconds + 20 seconds = 50 seconds. The total time required for the compilation on the workstation with the local disk is 30 seconds + 200 file page accesses \\* 0.05 seconds/page = 30 seconds + 200 \\* 0.05 seconds/page = 30 seconds + 10 seconds = 40 seconds.

The pipeline depth is the number of stages in the pipeline, and the clock cycle time is the time it takes for a clock cycle to complete. The pipeline depth and clock cycle time are inversely proportional to each other.\nIn this case, M-7 has a 7-stage pipeline and a clock cycle time of 7.5 nanoseconds, while M-5 has a 5-stage pipeline and a clock cycle time of 10 nanoseconds. This means that M-7\u2019s pipeline is deeper than M-5\u2019s pipeline, and therefore has a higher maximum throughput.\nHowever, the latency of a single instruction is the time it takes for the instruction to pass through the pipeline from the time it is fetched until it is executed. The latency is determined by the pipeline depth and the clock cycle time.\nIn this case, the latency of a single instruction is the same on both processors, as they have the same pipeline depth and clock cycle time.
