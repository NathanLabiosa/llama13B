The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis. It is not related to the level of significance or the type of test used. The power of a test is a measure of the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.

It is based on a theoretical framework. C. It is not important to have a good research design. D. It is not important to have a good research design as long as the data is collected. The correct answer is B. It is based on a theoretical framework. A good research design is based on a theoretical framework, which is a set of assumptions and concepts that guide the researcher's thinking and the design of the study. A good research design is also systematic, rigorous, and replicable. It is important to have a good research design as it helps to ensure that the study is well-planned, well-executed, and produces valid and reliable results. Answer: B. It is based on a theoretical framework.\n11"}

If a student studies for two hours, her grade will be calculated as follows: Grade = 50.25 + 10.2(2) = 50.25 + 20.4 = 70.65.

The standard deviation of the fuse times for Company I is 10 minutes, and the mean is 50 minutes. The standard deviation of the fuse times for Company II is 5 minutes, and the mean is 55 minutes. The probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is calculated as follows: P(X > 1 hour) = P(X > 1 hour | X \u2265 50 minutes) + P(X \u2265 50 minutes) P(X > 1 hour | X \u2265 50 minutes) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.5 P(X \u2265 50 minutes) = 0.5 P(X > 1 hour) = 0.5 0.5 = 0.841.
