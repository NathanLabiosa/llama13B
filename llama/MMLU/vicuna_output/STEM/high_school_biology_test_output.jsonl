Stabilizing selection is the process by which a population's genetic variation is maintained by favoring individuals that are intermediate in a particular trait.

This suggests that the population is under stabilizing selection for this trait.\n### 12. 12 (A) artificial selection. Artificial selection is the process by which humans intentionally select and breed individuals with desired traits to produce offspring with those traits. This can be done through selective breeding, where individuals with desired traits are mated with each other, or through selective breeding, where individuals with desired traits are separated from the population and bred with each other. Artificial selection is used to produce domesticated animals and plants, and it is a major force in the evolution of many species.\n### 13. 13 (B) directional selection.
