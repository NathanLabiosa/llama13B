First, it is not always practicable to present every participant with all the information about the study. For example, in some studies, it may be impractical to provide participants with detailed information about the study's methodology or statistical analysis plan. Second, sometimes it is desirable to withhold certain pieces of information, such as the length of time an interview will take, in order to avoid influencing the participant's decision to participate.
