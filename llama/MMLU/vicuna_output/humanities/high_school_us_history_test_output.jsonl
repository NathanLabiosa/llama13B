The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Christopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "\u200b(A) African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida.\n'The Spanish conquest of the Americas was a series of events that began in the late 15th century and lasted for more than three centuries.

The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following conclusions is best supported by the excerpt above?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states of the North, while McClellan won more sparsely populated states."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South to vote for Lincoln in the Election of 1864."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Republicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864, Harpweek.com\n### 1864"}

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "peace between Indian tribes and white settlers."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River."}, {"label": "D", "text": "a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "1.\nExplanation: The policy described most immediately led to the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.

The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value.

The Progressive Era (1900-1910)\n### 11.1.1. Overview\n\nThe Progressive Era was a period of reform in the United States that lasted from the 1890s to the 1920s. It was characterized by a desire to address social and economic problems, such as corruption, monopolies, and poverty, and to improve the lives of ordinary Americans. Progressives sought to reform government, business, and society in order to achieve these goals.\n\nThe Progressive Era was marked by a range of reforms, including the regulation of big business, the protection of workers' rights, the regulation of food and drugs, and the expansion of the role of the federal government in American life. The era also saw the rise of the women's suffrage movement and the growth of the labor movement.\n\nThe Progressive Era was a time of significant change in American society,"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our American civilization\u2026.The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nWhich one of the following was an unintended consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Liberal Democrats abandoned anti-war protests in a show of support for President Johnson."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Conservative Republicans mobilized to defend traditional mores and curb government authority."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Economic recession catalyzed by increased government spending causing \"stagflation.\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "A majority of Northern black voters abandoned the Democrat party, siding with Republicans."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "1960s, which refers to the unintended consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s.\n### 10. 1960s: The 1960s were a decade of significant social and political change in the United States.
