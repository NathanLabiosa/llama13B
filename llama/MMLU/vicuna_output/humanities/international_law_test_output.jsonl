Passive personality jurisdiction is a concept in international law that allows a state to exercise jurisdiction over a legal person, such as a corporation, based on the country where the legal person was registered. This type of jurisdiction is passive, meaning that the state does not have to take any active steps to assert jurisdiction over the legal person. Instead, the legal person has voluntarily submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the state by registering there. This type of jurisdiction is often used by states to regulate the activities of foreign corporations operating within their borders.\n11. 11 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1."}

The Golder v UK case (1978) is a good example of the ECtHR using this principle, as the court found that the UK's use of compulsory purchase orders to acquire land for a bypass was a violation of the property rights protected by Article 1 of the ECHR. The court found that the UK's use of the orders was not 'in accordance with the law' as required by the Article, as the UK had not provided adequate compensation to the landowners. The court also found that the UK had not provided a fair and impartial tribunal for the landowners to appeal their compensation awards, which was also a violation of Article 1.
