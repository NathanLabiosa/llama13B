The person may use highly emotionally charged terms without giving any reasons why those terms fit the subject. This is a fallacy because it is not based on reason or evidence, but on an attempt to manipulate the audience's emotions. Amphiboly is a fallacy in which a statement is ambiguous or has multiple meanings, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations. Equivocation is a fallacy in which a person uses different meanings of a word or phrase in the same argument, which can lead to confusion or misunderstandings. Loaded language is language that is intended to evoke a strong emotional response, often in a way that is not supported by the evidence or the facts. 3. Which of the following is a fallacy in"}
