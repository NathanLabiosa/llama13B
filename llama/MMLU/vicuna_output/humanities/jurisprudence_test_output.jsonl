The distinction is important because it allows Hart to distinguish between rules that are binding because they are backed by the threat of sanction and rules that are binding because they are accepted as legitimate by those who are bound by them. The other options do not accurately explain the purpose of Hart's distinction. (A) is incorrect because the distinction does not address the internal or external aspect of a rule.

The categorical imperative is a principle that Kant believed was necessary for moral action. It is the idea that one should act in a way that could be universalized and applied to everyone, without exception. The categorical imperative is the basis for Kant's ethical theory, which holds that moral actions are those that are done out of duty, rather than out of self-interest or desire. The categorical imperative is often summarized in the phrase \"Act only on that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\" This means that one should act in a way that could be universally applied, without exception. The categorical imperative is often contrasted with the hypothetical imperative, which is the idea that one should act in a way that is consistent with one's values and goals. The categorical imperative is considered to be a more rigorous and universal standard for moral action, as it requires that one act in a way that could be applied to everyone, without exception.\n11. 11 \u200b(A) You must not consciously harm another person.\u200b The"}

The statement 'Law is like language' is a more accurate reflection of Savigny's notion of a Volksgeist because it suggests that law is a living, evolving expression of a society's culture, rather than a static reflection of it. The statement 'Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will' is also a more accurate reflection of Savigny's notion of a Volksgeist because it suggests that law is a tool that a sovereign uses to shape and express the culture of a society.
