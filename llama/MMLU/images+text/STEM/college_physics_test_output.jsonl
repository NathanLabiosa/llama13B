The detector does not convert 90% of incoming photons into detected photons.\nSOLUTION: The detector will detect photons one at a time.

Which type of light is reflected and which is transmitted depends on the type of materials and the angle at which the light hits the boundary.\nAt a boundary between two materials, the angle of the reflected light is greater than the angle of the transmitted light. This is because the light is reflected from the boundary, and reflecting surface is perpendicular to the boundary.\nWhen light enters a material, it is absorbed by the material. The amount of light that is absorbed depends on the distance that the light travels into the material. The amount of light that is transmitted through the material is equal to the amount of light that is absorbed.\nThe amount of light that is reflected from a material is equal to the amount of light that is absorbed.\nSOLUTION: A thin layer of oil floats on the surface of the puddle.

The absorption spectrum shows the wavelengths of radiation that an element absorbs. The emission spectrum shows the wavelengths of radiation that an element emits.\nSOLUTION: The statement 'Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the nuclear structure of the sample' is not correct.\nLines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal the electronic structure of the sample. The electronic structure of an element is determined by the element's atomic spectrum. The atomic spectrum of an element is a function of the element's nuclear structure. But the nuclear structure of a sample does not determine its atomic spectrum. So, lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the electronic structure of the sample.\nThe statement 'The wavelengths identified in an absorption spectrum of an element are among those in its emission spectrum' is incorrect.\nWhen an element is heated, it emits radiation. But when an element is irradiated, it absorbs radiation. So, the wavelengths identified in an absorption spectrum of an element are not among those in its emission spectrum.\nThe statement 'Absorption spectra can be used to determine which elements are present in distant stars' is incorrect.\nAbsorption spectra can identify the elements in a nearby star. But the absorption spectrum of a distant star is not much different from its emission spectrum. So, if an element is present in a distant star, it is possible to determine which element it is. But if an element is not present in a distant star, its emission spectrum will not show which elements are in the star.\nThe statement 'Spectral analysis can be used to identify the composition of galactic dust' is incorrect.\nSpectral analysis can identify the elements in the dust. But the concentration of each element in the dust can be the same in all parts of the dust. So, spectral analysis can identify the composition of the dust, but the composition is the same throughout the dust."}

These two states are known as para- and ortho-excited states.\nThe observation that an ortho-excited state has lower energy than the corresponding para-excited state can be understood in terms of the Pauli exclusion principle. The Pauli principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers.\nAccording to the Pauli principle, the ortho-excited state has lower energy than the para-excited state because the electrons in the ortho-state are in different quantum states, or configurations, than the electrons in the para-state. As a result, the ortho-state has a smaller probability of causing the atom to lose energy by emitting a photon.\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle is not directly responsible for the lower energy of the ortho-state. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to determine both the position and the momentum of an object with total precision.\nNuclear hyperfine coupling describes the interaction between the spin of a nucleus and the spin of an electron. This interaction can increase the difference in energy between the para- and ortho-excited states. But even without nuclear hyperfine coupling, the para-state would have higher energy than the ortho-state.\nThe Bohr model of the atom is not responsible for the lower energy of the ortho-state. In the Bohr model, an atom consists of a nucleus and a single electron. The electron moves in a circular orbit around the nucleus."}

When a Cooper pair moves, it creates an electric current. This means that superconductors can be used to make wires that carry electricity without losing any power.\nSOLUTION: Interactions with the ionic lattice are caused by the way the atoms in the lattice are arranged.

So, when you remove one electron, the atom has a total of seven electrons and a positive charge of seven.\nThe ionization energy of a substance depends on the substance.

This difference is a measure of the time dilation and length contraction that occur when the hydrogen atoms in the quasar are moving relative to the hydrogen atoms in the laboratory.\nTime dilation and length contraction are caused by the motion of the hydrogen atoms.

{"question": "An object is thrown horizontally from the open window of a building. If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown?

The object's new speed is 80 m/s. The object was thrown from a height of 10.0 m.\nWhat was the object's speed after it was thrown?\nWhat is the relationship between an object's height and its speed after it is thrown?\nAn object's height above a level ground is directly proportional to its speed after it is thrown horizontally from that height. This means that if the height is doubled, the speed is doubled. And if the height is increased by a factor of 2, the speed is increased by a factor of 4.\nSOLUTION: The object's speed after it was thrown was 20 m/s. The object's height after it was thrown was 10.0 m. So, the object's height was 10.0 m."}

The particle's cyclotron frequency is given by\nf = qBv/2m\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, v is the speed of the particle, and m is its mass.\nSOLUTION: First, calculate the speed of the particle. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle, so the particle moves in a circular path with a radius of 1.5 meters. The distance between two parallel lines is the magnitude of the magnetic field. So, the speed of the particle is 1.5 meters per second.\nSecond, calculate the cyclotron frequency. The cyclotron frequency is directly proportional to the mass of the particle. So, the particle's mass is 3.3 * 10^-22 kg."}

This means that the object is moving 40 m/s down relative to the ground. The object is also moving 100 m/s north relative to the plane.\nIf air resistance is neglected, the object will continue to move in this way.\nSOLUTION: An object is dropped while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\nThe velocity of the payload relative to the plane is 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down. This velocity is not 40 m/s down relative to the ground. So, the payload is not moving 40 m/s down relative to the ground 4.0 s after it is released."}

So, the energy of the photon emitted in a transition from the state with n=3 to the state with n=1 is closest to the difference between the energy levels of the n=3 and n=1 states.\nThe energy levels of positronium are determined by the amount of energy the positron has. For a positron in positronium, the possible values of energy are from 0 to 2 times the rest mass energy of the positron.\nWhen an electron and a positron come together to form a positronium atom, the positron receives energy and moves to a higher energy level. The energy difference between the n=3 state and the n=1 state is 6 e, which is closest to 6.0 e."}

In our solar system, satellites are called moons.\nThe time it takes for a satellite to make one revolution around the object it orbits is called the satellite's orbital period.\nThe orbital period is dependent on the mass of the satellite, the mass of the object it orbits, and the distance between them.\nThe distance between the satellite and the object it orbits is called the radius of the satellite's orbit.\nThe radius of the orbit is dependent on the mass of the satellite and the mass of the object it orbits.\nSOLUTION: To determine the dependence of the orbital period on the mass of the planet, you need to use the formula for the orbital period.\nThe formula gives you the dependence of the orbital period on the mass of the planet.\nBecause the orbital period is proportional to the radius of the orbit, which is dependent on the mass of the planet, the time it takes for one revolution is also proportional to the mass of the planet."}
