Second messengers play important roles in intracellular signaling and communication.\nInositol triphosphate is a second messenger that stimulates release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. Inositol triphosphate is produced by the breakdown of a molecule called inositol trisphosphate. This breakdown releases energy that can be used to do work. One way inositol triphosphate can do work is by stimulating the release of calcium ions from cells.\nCalmodulin is a protein that binds to calcium ions. When calmodulin binds to calcium ions, it triggers the activation of other proteins. This can include proteins that stimulate the release of more calcium ions from cells.\nCyclic AMP is a second messenger that binds to proteins, which can trigger a response. One response that cyclic AMP can trigger is the activation of an enzyme that breaks down a molecule called glycogen. Glycogen is a simple sugar that can be used by cells for energy.\nProstaglandins are hormone-like molecules that are involved in inflammation and other processes. Prostaglandins cannot pass through cell membranes. When prostaglandins come in contact with cells, they can stimulate the release of calcium ions from cells."}

These hybrids can form when a cell's RNA template is used to build a new strand of DNA. This process is called reverse transcription and is important in the replication of some viruses.\nThe synthesis of an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template requires a DNA or RNA primer and reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase is a type of enzyme that can act on RNA or DNA. It can retrieve RNA sequences that are exposed because the RNA strand is single-stranded.\nThe choice of a DNA or RNA primer is not as critical as the presence of reverse transcriptase. A DNA or RNA primer can be added to the single-stranded RNA template, and reverse transcriptase can then build the new hybrid strand.\nRNase is an enzyme that breaks RNA down into its component nucleotides. RNase can degrade the single-stranded RNA template so that reverse transcriptase can retrieve the RNA sequence. However, RNase is not needed to synthesize an RNA/DNA hybrid.\nReverse transcriptase is necessary to synthesize an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template. Reverse transcriptase can act on the single-stranded RNA template to build a new strand that is a combination of RNA and DNA."}

When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small plant, a gametophyte.\nThe gametophyte is the dependent generation. It grows into a small plant that produces eggs and sperm. The eggs and sperm are released and fuse to form a zygote. The zygote then grows into a sporophyte.\nSOLUTION: Ferns have a dominant sporophyte and a dependent gametophyte. The sporophyte is the dominant generation, and the gametophyte is the dependent generation.\nThe dominant sporophyte produces spores. The sporophyte does not have a specific life stage for producing spores. Spores are produced by the sporophyte throughout its life.\nThe dependent gametophyte produces gametes. The gametophyte is the generation that produces eggs and sperm."}

A sarcomere is made up of two filaments: the thin filament and the thick filament.\nThe thin filament is made up of proteins called troponin and tropomyosin. The troponin proteins are attached to the actin proteins of the thin filament.\nThe thick filament is made up of proteins called myosin. The myosin proteins have a long, thin structure called an actin-binding site, which allows myosin to attach to the actin proteins.\nDuring muscle contraction, the actin and myosin proteins interact to form a strong bond. This bond pulls the two filaments closer together.\nThe interaction between the actin and myosin proteins is helped by proteins called regulatory proteins. These proteins change shape when a muscle is stimulated. This shape change causes the actin and myosin proteins to bind to each other."}

Its microspikes search for chemical or electrical signals that will help the neuron connect with other neurons.\nWhen a growth cone's microspikes make contact with a chemotactic signal, they can change the growth cone's direction of movement. This is called chemotaxis. The microspikes can also help the growth cone survive and regrow after it has retracted.\nCytochalasin B is a compound that prevents actin-myosin binding. This prevents the formation of contractile actin-myosin filaments. Because microfilaments are important for the survival of the growth cone, cytochalasin B inhibits the growth of the growth cone.\nWhen a nerve cell is developing, exposure to cytochalasin B can cause microtubules in the axon to dissociate.

Feedback inhibition is a process that happens when the end product of a metabolic pathway is fed back into the pathway. This feedback inhibition stops the pathway by inhibiting the first step in the pathway.\nOne example of a feedback inhibition pathway is the urea cycle. The urea cycle breaks down the waste product ammonia by converting it into urea. Urea is then excreted from the cell.\nIn the urea cycle, each step is regulated by feedback inhibition. For example, the first step in the urea cycle is regulated by feedback inhibition. This step makes carbamoyl phosphate. If carbamoyl phosphate builds up, it is converted back into ammonia and phosphate. The ammonia is excreted from the cell, and the phosphate is fed into another pathway.\nThe second step in the urea cycle is not regulated by feedback inhibition. Instead, this step is regulated by negative feedback. When the product of this step, ornithine, builds up, it is converted into a different product, citrulline.\nThis prevents the ornithine from feeding back into the first step of the urea cycle.\nSOLUTION: During each turn of the urea cycle, the amino acid ornithine is regenerated. Like ornithine, succinate is regenerated during each turn of the citric acid cycle.\nFumarate, on the other hand, is not regenerated during each turn of the citric acid cycle.\nOxaloacetate is not regenerated during each turn of the citric acid cycle.\nCitrate is regenerated during each turn of the citric acid cycle."}

Chromosomes contain genes, or pieces of hereditary material, that affect inherited traits.\nAn organism's chromosome number depends on the number of chromosomes in its cells. Most plant and animal cells have chromosomes in pairs. These pairs are made up of one chromosome inherited from each parent.\nWhen an organism reproduces, it passes copies of its chromosomes to its offspring. Offspring organisms receive their chromosomes from their parents.\nSOLUTION: The parent plant with the double chromosome number would have two copies of each chromosome. Or, to put it the other way around, each chromosome would have two copies.\nThese copies are not exact duplicates. So, the plant with the double chromosome number would not be genetically defective.\nBecause the parent plants were of different species, the plant with the double chromosome number would not be able to backcross with either parental species. This rules out the option of backcrossing.\nBut the plant would still be able to reproduce sexually. This is because the two copies of each chromosome can pair with each other during reproduction.\nSo, the descendants of the plant with the double chromosome number would be reproductively successful.

When the mitochondria produce ATP, they use oxygen and release carbon dioxide.\nThe mitochondria have their own DNA. They also have ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria can make their own proteins.\nA low external pH increases the concentration of OH- ions. The mitochondria can pump H+ ions out of the matrix. So, the increase in OH- ions causes the mitochondria to pump H+ ions to the intermembrane space.\nThe mitochondria use the H+ ions to create a concentration gradient. The gradient attracts H+ ions back into the matrix. The attracted H+ ions drive the production of ATP.\nA low external pH also increases the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix. The acid increases the pace of the reaction that produces ATP.\nA low external pH does not increase the diffusion of H+ ions from the intermembrane space to the matrix.

In Drosophila, there are nine homeotic genes organized in three clusters: the Antennapedia, Bithorax, and Bicoid clusters. These genes are named for the antennae of Drosophila, which have two segments. The genes in the Antennapedia cluster are responsible for the development of the antennae.\nMutations of homeotic cluster genes can result in different types of developmental defects. Here are some examples of what can go wrong in Drosophila:\nA single gene in a homeotic cluster can be mutated:\nIf a gene in a homeotic cluster is missing or nonfunctional, the segments it helps to determine may be missing or improperly formed. For example, in Drosophila, the ANT gene in the Antennapedia cluster is necessary for the development of the antennae. If the ANT gene is mutated, the antennae will be missing.\nMultiple genes in a homeotic cluster can be mutated:\nIf multiple genes in a homeotic cluster are mutated, the segments they help to determine may be absent or transformed. For example, in Drosophila, mutations in multiple genes in the Antennapedia cluster can cause the legs to be transformed into antennae.\nAll genes in a homeotic cluster can be mutated:\nIf all the genes in a homeotic cluster are mutated, the segments they help to determine may be absent or transformed, and the pattern of segments may be disrupted.

Osmosis is a passive process that moves water molecules through a membrane from an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential.\nThe water potential of water molecules in a plant's roots is higher than the water potential of water molecules in water. So, water enters the roots by osmosis.\nWhen a plant's roots are not completely underwater, water may enter the roots by capillary action. Capillary action is a passive process that moves water into the roots by absorption. The water rises up the side of the root and into the root by absorption.\nSOLUTION: The root pressure created by a plant's roots causes water to enter the roots by capillary action. Root pressure is the pressure that is created by the water that is absorbed by the roots.

An endosome is a membrane-bound compartment that surrounds the molecule and whisks it inside the cell.\nSome molecules are taken in by a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This process requires the formation of an endosome that engulfs the molecule.\nOther molecules are taken in by a process called clathrin-independent endocytosis. This process does not form an endosome before the molecule is taken in.\nCells can also secrete molecules by exocytosis. Exocytosis is the opposite of endocytosis.\nSOLUTION: Cell-surface receptors, endosome formation, and receptor-mediated endocytosis are all necessary for cholesterol uptake.

In these mammals, the concentration of urine is higher than the concentration of body fluids. So, when the mammal drinks water, the concentration of urine becomes even more hyperosmotic. This helps the mammal conserve water.\nThe kidneys of saltwater fishes produce urine hyperosmotic to their tissues.\nSaltwater fishes produce urine that is more concentrated than their tissues. This releases excess salt and helps the fishes conserve water.\nMalpighian tubules allow insects to excrete waste through the exoskeleton.\nInsects do not have kidneys or other internal organs to filter waste. Instead, waste is eliminated through openings in the exoskeleton. Malpighian tubules are tiny organs that filter waste from the insect's blood. The waste is then eliminated through the exoskeleton."}
