Energy sources use energy from their environment in a different way.\nA type-Ia supernova is a type of explosion. Type-Ia supernovas get their energy from the conversion of matter into energy.\nType-Ia supernovas occur in binary systems. A binary system is a system of two objects.\nThe two objects in a binary system are usually stars. One star in the binary system is usually larger than the other.\nWhen the smaller star runs out of hydrogen, it gets larger and larger. Its gravity pulls more matter from the larger star. The matter from the larger star falls onto the smaller star and forms a white dwarf.\nThe white dwarf gets very hot. It can get energy by converting some of its matter into energy. This process creates a type-Ia supernova.\nA type-Ia supernova produces high amounts of X-rays.\nA type-Ia supernova also produces gamma-rays. Gamma-rays are a type of radiation.\nA type-Ia supernova occurs in young galaxies.\nA galaxy is a group of stars. Galaxies come in many shapes.\nSome galaxies are born quickly and die quickly.

For example, if it takes Jupiter 12 years to complete one orbit and 6 years to complete two orbits, and these times are equal to the numbers of years it takes one of its moons to complete one or two orbits, then the moon is in resonance.\nThe orbits of Jupiter's moons are in resonance when the time it takes for one moon to complete an orbit is equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4 times the time it takes for another moon to complete an orbit.\nSOLUTION: The Jupiter's moons in resonance pull Io in different directions and generate heat.\nIo is the innermost moon of Jupiter. The other moons flex Io back and forth. This flexing generates heat in Io.\nThe orbit of Io is slightly elliptical. Io's orbit is not perfectly circular. It is slightly elliptical.\nThe 1:2:4 resonance makes the orbit of Io slightly elliptical. The 1:2:4 resonance makes Io move around Jupiter in an elliptical orbit.\nA gap with no asteroids between the orbits prevents the formation of the ring material into other moons. The orbits of Jupiter's moons are in a gap in the asteroids. No asteroids are in this gap. So, the ring material cannot form into other moons in this gap.\nThe 1:2:4 resonance pulls Io in different directions and generates heat. This happens because the 1:2:4 resonance makes Io move around Jupiter in a specific way. Io is pulled in different directions by Jupiter's gravity as it moves around Jupiter. This pulling generates heat in Io."}

The acceleration of the universe is the increase in the expansion of the universe.\nThe radiation of black holes is a model that helps explain the energy source of active galactic nuclei. Active galactic nuclei are the most extreme stellar environments.\nThe mass distribution of galaxies is a model that helps explain the structure of the universe. The structure of the universe is the arrangement of matter in the universe.\nThe universe is made up of matter and energy. Matter is made up of particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds.\nWhen two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. So, matter is made of molecules.\nThe links between atoms in molecules are called chemical bonds. The different types of chemical bonds link atoms together in different ways.\nThe links between atoms in a molecule affect the way a molecule behaves. Different molecules behave in different ways.\nFor example, water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The chemical bond between the hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atom tells water how to behave.\nSOLUTION: The microwave background of the universe is a model that helps explain the big bang. The big bang is the model for the creation of the universe.\nThe microwave background of the universe is a map of the big bang. A map shows the location of things. This map shows the location of energy in the universe.\nThe energy in the universe is not evenly distributed. Some regions of the universe have more energy than others.\nDark energy is a model that helps explain the acceleration of the universe. The acceleration of the universe is the increase in the expansion of the universe.\nThe expansion of the universe is the increase in the distance between two points. The distance between two points is called a distance.\nThis expansion is the result of a type of energy called dark energy. Dark energy makes the universe expand."}

A planet is more compact and therefore larger if it has a higher density.\nPlanets are made of different materials. Their densities depend on their material composition.\nFor example, Jupiter is composed mostly of gas. Its density is low. So, Jupiter is large.\nOur Sun is composed mostly of gas. Its density is low. So, the Sun is large.\nA planet's size is also affected by its mass. A planet is further from the Sun if it is more massive.

A theory is a well-substantiated explanation that refers to a specific group of phenomena.\nThe nebular theory of the formation of the solar system is supported by evidence from many fields of science. This theory explains the formation of the Sun, planets, and other objects in the solar system.\nAccording to the nebular theory, the Sun and its family of planets formed from a cloud of gas and dust called the nebula. The nebula was a large, spinning disk. The material in the nebula drained together in the center to form the Sun. The rest of the material spread out to form the planets.\nSOLUTION: The nebular theory predicts that planets orbit around the Sun in nearly circular orbits in a flattened disk. It also predicts that the equal number of terrestrial and jovian planets. These two predictions are not in conflict with each other.\nCraters on the Moon are remnants of meteor impacts. The nebular theory predicts that asteroids, Kuiper-belt comets and the Oort cloud contain many remnants of meteor impacts. But it does not predict that all of the meteor impacts will be caused by asteroids, Kuiper-belt comets, or Oort cloud objects.\nThe nebular theory does not predict that asteroids, Kuiper-belt comets and the Oort cloud are more likely to collide with the Sun than with each other."}

This means that the Moon moves in a plane that is different from the plane of the Earth's path around the Sun.\nSOLUTION: If the Moon's orbital plane were exactly the same as the ecliptic plane, the Moon would move exactly in the Earth's path around the Sun. So, the Moon would always pass through the same places relative to the Sun.\nIf the Moon's orbital plane were exactly the same as the ecliptic plane, the Moon would always cross the ecliptic plane exactly once per orbit.

So, the shorter the line connecting the two cities, the closer the cities are to the equator.\nEratosthenes measured the angle of the Sun's rays at the zenith in Alexandria and Syene (now Aswan) on the summer solstice. He found that the angle of the Sun's rays was 7\u00b0 smaller in Syene than in Alexandria.\nAntarctica is covered in ice, and the South Pole is a distant, icy land.

An ellipse is a stretched-out circle.\nAn orbit is influenced by two forces: the force of gravity, which pulls matter together, and the force of momentum, which keeps an object moving in the direction it was moving.\nThe Sun does not pull on the Earth any more than it pulls on the other planets. But the Sun does have mass, and it is the center of the orbit. So, the force of gravity pulls the Earth back toward the Sun.\nThe position of an object in its orbit is called its trajectory. The diagram below shows the trajectory of a planet around a star.\nThe distance between the planet and the star is called the distance of the planet from the star. This distance affects the time it takes for the planet to go around the star.\nThe time it takes for the planet to go around the star is called the planet's orbit time.\nSOLUTION: The time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun affects the length of a year. So, if the Earth was instantly moved to an orbit three times further away from the Sun, the distance of the Earth from the Sun would be three times greater.\nBecause the distance of the Earth from the Sun is three times greater, the time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun would be 3 times longer.

The layer that is closest to the planet's center is the core. The core is surrounded by a layer called the mantle. The mantle is made up of rock.\nThe core of a planet is very hot. Some planets have a solid, inner core and a liquid outer core. The outer core is made of metal.\nBoth the core and the mantle are made of strong materials. The mantle is strong in part because of the material olivine. Olivine is a type of rock that is very strong and can help keep the planet's core and mantle from melting.\nSOLUTION: Jovian planets have a squashed appearance because of their rapid rotation. The planet's equator is flung outward because of the planet's rotation.\nJovian planets are much more massive than terrestrial planets. So, their internal heat sources exert a pressure against the sides of the planets.\nTheir large systems of moons and rings do not attract the mass around the equator more."}

For example, Earth has a tropical zone, a temperate zone, and a polar zone.\nThe habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures are right for liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet. Liquid water is a vital ingredient for life as we know it.\nSOLUTION: Organisms on a planet's surface need liquid water. Water vapor in the atmosphere of a planet can help keep organisms warm. But liquid water is required for life.\nThe habitable zone is the region around a star where the temperature is right for liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet. This zone is called the habitable zone because it is the region where life might exist.\nLife can survive and thrive in many different places. Humans are surviving in places that are cold, hot, wet, and dry. So, the habitable zone is the region where humans can survive. But the habitable zone is not the same as the region where humans can thrive.\nUltraviolet radiation is harmful to organisms. So, the region around a star where the ultraviolet radiation does not destroy organisms on a planet's surface is not in the habitable zone.\nThe region around a star where life exists is in the habitable zone. But the region around a star where life exists is not the same as the habitable zone.\nThere are other zones around stars. For example, there is a zone where planets are formed. This zone is not in the habitable zone."}

Some types of stars are used to measure distances, while others are used to measure temperatures. Cepheid variable stars are tools for measuring distances.\nCepheid variable stars are a type of star that changes brightness. By watching a Cepheid variable star's brightness change, astronomers can figure out its distance. Because Cepheid variable stars are bright, they can be seen in distant galaxies.\nSOLUTION: Distance is the amount of space between two things. Galactic distances are the amounts of space between Earth and stars in our galaxy.\nAstronomers can use Cepheid variable stars to measure galactic distances.

The bolometric luminosity is the total luminosity of a star integrated over all wavelengths.\nThe luminosity is a measure of the rate at which a star emits energy. The unit of bolometric luminosity is the solar luminosity, which is a unit of energy per second.\nThe bolometric luminosity is a difficult quantity to observe.
