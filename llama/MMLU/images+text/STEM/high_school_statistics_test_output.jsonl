If one part of an experiment is different, the result will be different. So, experiments have variables that are tested.\nExperiments can be designed to have two groups: an experimental group and a control group.

The experiment had two groups: a group that drank the alcohol and a group that did not. The reaction time of the nondrinking group was measured before and after the experiment.\nThe reaction time of the drinking group was also measured before and after the experiment. Since each person was his or her own control, the experiment was able to determine if the alcohol affected reaction time.\nLack of blocking makes this a poorly designed study.\nBlocking is when participants are randomly put into groups. This prevents external factors from affecting the experiment.\nIn this study, the participants were not blocked. So, their reaction time before drinking the alcohol might be different from each other. This makes it impossible to determine if the alcohol itself affects reaction time.\nThe placebo effect is irrelevant in this type of study.\nThe placebo effect is when patients get better because they believe that they are being treated.

For example, flipping a coin and rolling a dice are independent. The probability of flipping a coin as heads or tails does not affect the probability of rolling a dice as 2 or 3.\nTwo events are mutually exclusive if only one of the events can happen. For example, picking a card from a deck and picking a card from a second deck are mutually exclusive. If you pick a card from the first deck, you have not picked a card from the second deck, and vice versa.\nThe intersection of two events is the set of outcomes that are in both events. The probability of the intersection is the probability of each event happening. For example, if getting heads on a coin flip and getting the number 3 on a dice roll are both in an event, then the intersection is the set of outcomes where you get heads on the coin flip and get the number 3 on the dice roll. The probability of the intersection is the probability of getting heads on the coin flip times the probability of getting the number 3 on the dice roll.\nThe union of two events is the set of outcomes that are in either of the events. The probability of the union is the probability of each event happening. For example, if getting heads on a coin flip and getting the number 3 on a dice roll are both in an event, then the union is the set of outcomes where you get heads on the coin flip or get the number 3 on the dice roll. The probability of the union is the probability of getting heads on the coin flip + the probability of getting the number 3 on the dice roll.\nSOLUTION: The probability of the union of events A and B is not equal to 1. So, P(A \u222a B) = 1 does not have to be true.\nTwo events are independent if the probability of the intersection is zero.

The range of values between the mean and the standard deviation is one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above the mean. This range contains 68% of the values.\nThe range of values between the mean and two standard deviations is two standard deviations below the mean to two standard deviations above the mean.

A margin of error tells you how much the results of a survey may differ from what would be obtained if all members of the population were surveyed. A margin of error is not a measurement of the precision of the survey.\nThe margin of error is based on the sample size and the standard deviation of the population. The larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error. For example, a margin of error of 0.10 for a sample of 100 provides a less precise measure of the population value than a margin of error of 0.05 for a sample of 25.\nThe value of the margin of error is given as a percentage of the estimated outcome. For example, if the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is 0.40, and the margin of error is 0.05, then the estimated proportion is 0.40 \u00b1 0.05. This means that the true proportion is likely to be between 0.35 and 0.45.\nSOLUTION: The margin of error is 5%.

We can use these results to estimate the mean height of adults in the United States.\nA confidence interval for the mean height of adults in the United States would be 69 +/- 3. This interval means that the mean height of adults in the United States is estimated to be 69 inches, with a margin of error of 3 inches.\nBecause this interval is centered on the sample mean, it is a confidence interval for the population mean.\nThe confidence level is the probability that the interval will contain the population value. For example, a confidence level of 95 means that the interval is expected to contain the population value 95 times out of 100 times.\nMany researchers want to be 95% confident that their interval estimates contain the population value. In this case, the confidence level is 95%.\nThe margin of error is the amount by which the interval extends beyond the estimate. For example, if the margin of error for a interval estimate is 3 inches, then the actual value for the population is expected to be within 3 inches of the estimate 95% of the time.\nIf the margin of error is 0, then the estimate is a exact value. If the margin of error is 5, then the estimate is a rough value."}

You could investigate this question with the following experiment:\nYou grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, it is called the treatment.\nThe other group of pea plants is grown in soil without fertilizer and is used as a control. You can compare the control group to the treatment group to see if the treatment has a specific effect. Since the control group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is controlled.\nExperiments have blocks of animals, plants, or people. These blocks help investigate whether the outcome of the experiment depends on the group that is tested.

Different types of studies have different designs. Here are some ways in which studies can be designed:\nA randomized controlled study is a type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to a group. This design helps to ensure that the groups are similar.\nA double-blind study is a type of study in which the participants and the researchers are not allowed to know which group the participant is in. This can help to eliminate bias.\nAn observational study is a type of study in which researchers observe what happens to a group of people. This type of study can be difficult to interpret, because the researchers cannot directly control the variables they are observing.\nA single-blind study is a type of study in which the researchers are not allowed to know which group the participant is in. This can help to eliminate bias.\nA cluster randomized study is a type of study in which groups of people are randomly assigned to a group. This design can be used when it is not practical to assign participants to groups individually.\nA cross-sectional study is a type of study that examines data from different groups of people at a specific point in time. This type of study can provide information about what was observed at that time, but it does not allow investigators to conclude what came first or what caused what.\nA cohort study is a type of study that follows a group of people over time.

The level of confidence is a percentage that represents how likely the interval is to contain the true population proportion or average.\nFor example, a 95% confidence interval means that the interval is expected to contain the true population proportion or average 95% of the time. If the true proportion or average is outside the confidence interval, it means that the results are less significant.\nThe sample proportion is the proportion of the sample that has the characteristic of interest.\nTo construct a 95% confidence interval, you need to find the sample size that makes the margin of error equal to the amount of error you are willing to accept. The margin of error is the amount of error that the confidence interval is expected to have.\nFor example, if the true proportion of students with the correct address on record is 0.8 and you want a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of 0.05, then the sample size needs to be 150.\nThe sample proportion is 0.85.

For a fixed alpha level, there is a critical value for the right tail of the curve. If the value of X is in this critical region, then the test rejects the null hypothesis.\nSOLUTION: The curve for the \u03c72 probability distribution function is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable. So, for the same \u03b1, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases."}

The standard error of the mean is an estimate of the standard deviation of the mean of a population.\nThe standard error of the mean is calculated as the standard deviation of the sample mean.\nIf the standard deviation of the population is unknown, the standard error of the mean can be used to calculate the confidence interval for the mean. The confidence interval for the mean is a range of values that contains the mean of the population with a certain degree of confidence.\nThe confidence interval for the mean is calculated by adding and subtracting the standard error of the mean to and from the sample mean.\nFor example, if the sample mean is 74\u00b0F, the standard error of the mean is 2\u00b0F, and the desired confidence level is 95%, then the confidence interval for the mean is 72\u00b0F to 76\u00b0F.\nSOLUTION: The mean of the final exam scores was 112 points, and the standard deviation was 10 points. The mean of the midterm scores was 52 points, and the standard deviation was 4 points.\nThe scores are not at the same level of measurement. The final exam scores are at the same level of measurement as the midterm scores.\nThe z-score for the final exam is 118 points. This is the value that the student's score on the final exam would have to be at to have the same standardized score as the midterm."}

The mean is the average value of the data, and the median is the middle value of the data. For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal.\nFor a normal distribution, the values 1.5 and 2.5 units from the mean are called the first and second quartiles, respectively. The first quartile is at the value x such that 25% of the data fall below x, and the second quartile is at the value x such that 50% of the data fall below x.\nThe difference between the first and third quartiles is called the range.

One approach is to block experimental units.\nWater is about to be added to the beaker.\nIf the water is added to the beaker before the experimental units are blocked, some experimental units will receive the water before others. This could affect the measurements.\nBy blocking the experimental units, the experimenter can make sure that each experimental unit is tested the same way.\nFor example, if the experimenter is investigating how water affects the growth of pea plants, the experimenter could water the plants in the afternoon.

By random sampling, researchers can get a representative sample of a population.\nThere are two methods for choosing samples in random sampling:\nStratified random sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups, or strata, and then randomly sampling from each stratum. This method can be useful when the population is divided into distinct groups that are relatively equal in size.\nSimple random sampling involves randomly selecting samples from the entire population. This method is best when the subgroups in a stratified sample are not clearly defined or when the population is homogenous.\nSOLUTION: When done correctly, a stratified random sample is less biased than a simple random sample.\nA stratified random sample is less biased because it is less likely to distort the population's true distribution.\nA simple random sample can provide, with a smaller sample size, an estimate that is just as reliable as that of a stratified random sample with a larger sample size.\nA smaller stratified random sample is less reliable than a larger stratified random sample.\nA stratified random sample provides information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole, and a simple random sample does not.\nB."}

Keep doing this until you have a sample of the desired size.\nConvenience sampling is not as random as simple random sampling.

We can use this standard error to calculate how confident we can be that the true population mean is within a certain range of the sample mean.\nOne way to do this is to use the standard error to calculate the range of values within which the true population mean is estimated to lie. This range is called a confidence interval.\nThe confidence interval for the mean is calculated by adding and subtracting the standard error to the sample mean.\nFor example, the mean of a sample of 10 numbers is 20. The standard error of the mean is 2.5.\nTo calculate the confidence interval of 20, add and subtract 2.5 from the sample mean:\n20 \u00b1 2.5\nSo, the confidence interval is 17.5 to 22.5.\nThis means that the true population mean is estimated to lie between 17.5 and 22.5.

Accordingly, as part of her analysis she plans to generate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line for the two variables. The interval is determined to be (0.45, 0.80). Which of the following is (are) true?\n(Assistant: LECTURE: To determine whether a relationship between two variables is predictive, you can use confidence intervals to assess whether the true population slope is zero.\nA non-zero population slope indicates a predictive relationship. If the confidence interval for the population slope does not include zero, you have evidence of a non-zero population slope. In this case, it is likely that there is a non-zero correlation between the two variables.\nA 95% confidence interval for the population slope does not include zero if the lower bound of the interval is below zero. Such an interval indicates that the best estimate for the population slope is zero, but you cannot rule out the possibility that the population slope is negative. This suggests that there is some evidence of a predictive relationship, but you cannot be sure that the relationship is predictive.\nA 95% confidence interval for the population slope includes zero. Such an interval indicates that the best estimate for the population slope is zero, and you cannot be sure of a predictive relationship.\nSOLUTION: The confidence interval for the population slope is (0.45, 0.80).\nThe lower bound of the interval is 0.45. This is below zero. So, the interval does not include zero.\nTherefore, it is likely that there is a non-zero correlation between the two variables."}

A Type II error is also called a beta error.\nThe probability of a Type II error is determined by the level of significance. A significance level of alpha is the probability of a Type I error. A Type I error is the opposite of a Type II error.\nA Type II error would occur if the following conclusions are drawn:\nthe new drug is not more effective than the old drug\nthe experimental group does not do better than the control group\nthe new treatment is not more effective than the current treatment\nthe experimental group does not have a better outcome than the control group\nThe level of significance determines the probability of a Type II error. An alpha level of 0.1 indicates that the experimenter is willing to risk a Type II error that is 10% true. An alpha level of 0.05 indicates that the experimenter is willing to risk a Type II error that is 5% true.\nA potential consequence of a Type II error is that patients will continue to use the current medication, even though the new medication is actually more effective. This error would lead to unnecessary suffering and death.\nAnother potential consequence of a Type II error is that researchers will conclude that the new drug is not more effective than the old drug. This error would lead to the continued use of the old drug."}
