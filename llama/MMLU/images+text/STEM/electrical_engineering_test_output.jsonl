A step up chopper uses a switch to convert an AC voltage to a higher DC voltage.\nThe duty cycle of a chopper is the ratio of on-time to off-time. When the switch is on, the chopper is converting AC voltage to DC voltage. When the switch is off, the chopper is not converting voltage.\nThe duty cycle of a chopper affects the amount of voltage converted. For example, if the duty cycle is 0.5, then the chopper converts voltage only for half of each cycle. If the duty cycle is 0.8, then the chopper converts voltage for three-fourths of each cycle.\nSOLUTION: The duty cycle of a step up chopper affects the output voltage. To determine the value of the duty cycle, consider the following:\nThe input voltage is 110 V and the output voltage is 150 V. The duty cycle affects the amount of voltage converted. For example, if the duty cycle is 0.32, then the chopper converts 0.32 times as much voltage as it does with a duty cycle of 0.67.\nSo, with a duty cycle of 0.32, the chopper converts 110 V x 0.32 = 35.2 V of input voltage to output voltage. This is less than the desired output voltage of 150 V.\nWith a duty cycle of 0.67, the chopper converts 110 V x 0.67 = 75.9 V of input voltage to output voltage. This is more than the desired output voltage of 150 V.\nSo, the correct answer is 0.67."}

Files are stored on a computer's hard drive, and each file is represented by a unique name, or name/address. When a computer program needs to use a file, it sends a message to the operating system, which is like a dishwasher. The operating system loads the file into memory, or into a \"dish,\" so that the program can use it. When the program is done using the file, it sends another message to the operating system, which puts the file back on the hard drive, or into a storage area called a \"dishwasher.\"\nThe analogy is not exact. A computer's memory is organized so that it can store and use many files at the same time. This organization is called a stack. Each time a file is moved into memory, it is put on top of the stack. So, a file can be \"stacked\" on top of other files that are already in memory.\nWhen a file is removed from memory, it is taken off the top of the stack. This is called popping a file from the stack.\nFiles can also be moved around on the stack to make room for new files. This is called stacking a file.\nSOLUTION: Stack is also known as.\nThe stack is a type of memory. When a program uses a function, or subroutine, the function's instructions are stored in the stack. When the program is done with the function, the instructions are removed from the stack.\nThe stack is different from other types of memory in that it is organized in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner. This means that the most recent items added to the stack are the first ones out.\nWhen a computer program uses a function, the function's instructions are stored in the stack. When the program is done with the function, the instructions are removed from the stack."}

The armature coil is connected to the motor, and the magnetic field interacts with the armature coil to produce a current in the armature coil. This current is used to power the motor.\nThe diagram below shows the connections for a simple Ward-Leonard system. The power source is connected to the field coil. The armature coil is connected to the motor.\nThe power in the system is determined by the current in the field coil. To maintain a constant speed, the power in the field coil must change to compensate for any change in the torque needed by the motor.\nSOLUTION: The lower limit of the speed imposed by field resistance means that there is a minimum speed that the motor can achieve. If the motor tries to rotate faster than this minimum speed, the field resistance will increase, and the motor will slow down."}

It measures the intensity of light striking a surface.\n1 lux is the light intensity that provides a luminance of 1 candle per square meter. So, 1 lux is roughly equal to the light intensity that a candle would provide if it were 1 meter away from a surface that was 1 square meter in size.\nThe candle power of a light source is a measure of the rate at which the light source emits luminous flux. It is measured in candle power.\nSo, the candle power of a light source is a measure of the brightness of the light source.\nTo find the candle power of a lamp, you need to determine the rate at which the lamp emits luminous flux. You can do this by looking up the lamp's luminous flux and its wattage.\nThe wattage of a light source is a measure of the rate at which the light source uses electricity. A higher wattage indicates a higher rate of electricity use.\nThe luminous flux of a light source is a measure of the total amount of visible light emitted by the light source.

When a thyristor is turned on, it allows current to flow. When it is turned off, it stops the current.\nThyristors are used in motor control, power control, and other applications. They are also called silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs).\nSOLUTION: A thyristor has two states: on and off. To turn a thyristor on, a small amount of current must be applied to it. This current is called the trigger current.\nThe trigger current is different for each type of thyristor. For some types, the trigger current is as low as 0.002 A. For others, it is as high as 0.01 A.\nThe latching current is the current a thyristor needs to stay on after it has been turned on by the trigger current. To keep a thyristor on, a higher current than the trigger current is needed. This current is called the latching current.\nThe latching current is usually higher than the trigger current. For example, the latching current for a thyristor with a trigger current of 0.002 A might be 0.009 A."}
