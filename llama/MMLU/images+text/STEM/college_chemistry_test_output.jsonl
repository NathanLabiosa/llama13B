However, this approach does not provide information about the intermediates. Intermediates are not formed in equal proportions, so their relative concentrations are not necessarily equal to their absolute concentrations.\nTo measure the concentration of intermediates, you can use spin trapping. This method uses a spin-labeled ligand that specifically binds to the intermediate. The intermediate is trapped by the spin label, which prevents it from reacting further. The spin-labeled intermediate can then be detected by EPR.\nThe EPR signal from the spin-labeled intermediate is proportional to the concentration of the intermediate. So, spin trapping can be used to measure the concentration of intermediates.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nSteady state concentration of free radical intermediates is often too low to enable direct detection by EPR.\nDirect detection by EPR is not sensitive enough to measure the steady state concentration of free radical intermediates.\nSpin trapping provides more structural information than direct detection by EPR.\nSpin trapping can be used to detect the formation of a specific intermediate by trapping it with a spin label.\nDetection of spin adducts requires lower power than direct detection of radical intermediates.\nSpin trapping requires less power than directly detecting the free radical intermediates."}

Isotopes are variants of a chemical element. They have the same number of protons in their nuclei, but different numbers of neutrons. Because of the different numbers of neutrons, isotopes of a element have different atomic masses.\nRadioactive isotopes are radioactive. That is, they emit radiation. The radiation emitted by a radioactive isotope is called gamma radiation because it appears to be a high-energy electromagnetic wave.\nThe half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for exactly half of the isotope to transform into a different isotope. For example, if a 500-mCi sample of a radioactive isotope has a half-life of 6.0 hours, exactly half of the isotope will transform into a different isotope in 6.0 hours. The remaining isotope will be left in 6.0 hours.\nSOLUTION: The half-life of the radioactive isotope is 6.0 hours. This means that exactly half of the isotope will transform into a different isotope in 6.0 hours.\nThe quantity of the radioactive isotope has an activity of 150 mCi when it is delivered to the hospital. To determine how much activity will remain 24 hours after delivery, consider how much of the isotope will transform into a different isotope in 24 hours.\nExactly half of the isotope will transform into a different isotope in 6.0 hours.

The elements that make up molecules are charged, and the charge of an element is called its mass-to-charge ratio.\nThe three main parts of a mass spectrometer are the ionizer, the mass analyzer, and the detector.\nThe ionizer converts the molecules to be analyzed into ions. The ionizer can use several different techniques to convert the molecules. One common technique is to use a electron beam to break up the molecules into ions.\nThe mass analyzer separates the ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. The mass analyzer uses electric and magnetic fields to separate the ions. Ions with a higher mass-to-charge ratio are deflected more than ions with a lower mass-to-charge ratio.\nThe detector detects the ions and displays them as a mass spectrum. A mass spectrum is a graph of the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions. The x-axis shows the mass-to-charge ratio, and the y-axis shows the number of ions.\nSOLUTION: I.

Mendeleev's periodic table is the first modern version of the table.\nScientists can use spectroscopy to identify the elements in a sample. Each element has its own unique spectrum.\nIn the early 1900 s, scientists were able to use spectroscopy to determine the composition of stars. This led to a revolution in our understanding of the universe.\nScientists use many types of spectroscopy. Some of the most common types are listed below.\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy uses magnetic fields and radio waves to examine the structure and composition of molecules.\nInfrared (IR) spectroscopy uses infrared light to examine the structure of molecules.\nRaman spectroscopy uses light to examine the structure of molecules.\nUltraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy uses ultraviolet light and visible light to examine the absorption and emission of light by molecules.\nSOLUTION: Raman spectroscopy is a light-scattering technique. When light passes through a sample in Raman spectroscopy, the sample scatters the light.

It is the final value that this property reaches as the temperature of the substance approaches infinity.\nThere are several ways to calculate the limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume for a substance. One way is to calculate the molar heat capacity at constant volume for a substance at increasing temperatures and to approach the problem as if the temperatures were approaching infinity.\nAnother way is to use the limiting values of other properties as the temperatures approach infinity. For example, the limiting high-temperature value of any thermodynamic property is equal to the value of that property for an ideal, perfectly conducting gas at the same temperature.\nSOLUTION: To calculate the limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume for a diatomic molecule, you need to find the limiting values of C_V for a diatomic gas as the temperature approaches infinity.\nAn ideal, perfectly conducting gas has a limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume of 3R.

These ions can pull or push on nearby magnets when they interact with material that contains magnets. This property makes these ions useful as probes in certain medical tests.\nWhen one of these paramagnetic ions interacts with another molecule, the interaction can be used to monitor the other molecule.

For example, if an ion is too large, it cannot enter a cell through a small place called a gap junction.\nSOLUTION: The radii of the ions are shown in the table below.\n| Ion | Atomic radius | Ionic radius |\n| K+ | 1.0 | 1.0 |\n| Rb+ | 1.0 | 1.0 |\n| Ca2+ | 1.0 | 1.3 |\n| Sc3+ | 1.0 | 1.5 |\nThe atomic radius of K+ is 1.0. The ionic radius of K+ is also 1.0. So, K+ has the smallest radius."}

The nucleus will be magnetized when it is exposed to an external magnetic field. The magnetization of the nucleus will cause a magnetic field to be produced around the nucleus. This magnetic field will change depending on the orientation of the nucleus.\nThe NMR frequency is the frequency at which this magnetic field will change. The NMR frequency is different for each nucleus.\nFor a given external magnetic field, the NMR frequency is related to the nuclear magnetization by the equation:\nNMR frequency = \u03b3 / \u03bd\nWhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio for the nucleus and \u03bd is the external magnetic field strength.\nThe gyromagnetic ratio \u03b3 is a constant for each nucleus. For a given nucleus, the NMR frequency increases as the external magnetic field strength increases.\nSOLUTION: The NMR frequency of 31P in a 20.0 T magnetic field can be calculated as follows:\nNMR frequency = \u03b3 / \u03bd\nUsing the gyromagnetic ratio for 31P, which is 288.7 MHz T^-1, and the external magnetic field strength, which is 20.0 T:\nNMR frequency = 288.7 MHz T^-1 / 20.0 T\nNMR frequency = 14.435 MHz\nThe NMR frequency of 31P in a 20.0 T magnetic field is 14.435 MHz."}

The number of lines can range from a few lines to many lines. The EPR spectrum of a substance contains information about the chemical environment of the electrons.\nEPR spectra have two types of lines: sharp lines and broad lines.\nSharp lines have a well-defined frequency. These lines are also called \"resolved lines.\" They are usually shown as doublets, because the EPR spectrum of a substance contains two ends.\nBrother lines have a broad frequency. These lines are also called \"unresolved lines.\" They are usually shown as a single line.\nThe number of lines in an EPR spectrum is an odd number. This is because EPR spectra have two ends, or ends that are not equal.\nSOLUTION: The EPR spectrum of a solution of dimethylnitroxide has two ends. So, the number of lines in the EPR spectrum is an odd number.\nThe EPR spectrum of a solution of dimethylnitroxide also has two ends that are not equal. So, the number of lines in the EPR spectrum is either 2 or 3.\nThere are two ends in the EPR spectrum of dimethylnitroxide. So, the number of lines in the EPR spectrum is 2."}
