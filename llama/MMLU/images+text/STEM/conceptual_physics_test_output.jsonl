Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\nSOLUTION: The second law of thermodynamics tells you that heat doesn\u2019t flow from cold to hot. So, cold to hot ever is not true.\nHot to cold without external energy is not true. At temperatures much lower than the boiling point, heat doesn\u2019t flow from cold water to hot water. But external energy can change this. For example, heat from the surroundings can make the water get hotter over time.\nCold to hot without external energy is not true. At temperatures much higher than the boiling point, heat doesn\u2019t flow from hot water to cold water. But external energy can change this. For example, heat from the surroundings can make the water get cooler over time.\nHot to cold ever is not true. This applies to both external and internal changes."}

The energy of moving molecules is called thermal energy. The greater the thermal energy of the molecules, the higher their average speed.\nThe average speed of molecules in a gas depends on the temperature of the gas. Temperature measures how hot or cold the gas is. If the temperature goes up, the average speed of the molecules goes up. The more kinetic energy the molecules have, the higher their average speed.\nSOLUTION: At a given temperature, the molecules of a certain gas have the greatest average speed if that gas is the most massive gas in the mixture. The more massive a gas, the more often it will be involved in collisions. Since the temperature is constant, the molecules of the most massive gas will have the highest average speed.\nBut all have the same speed on average. This answer choice is incorrect. The average speed of all the molecules in the mixture is equal."}

This can be demonstrated by the following experiment.\nHold two hands out in front of you, as if you were holding a football.\nWave one hand back and forth perpendicular to the other.\nTry to get your hands to touch. The energy will not pass through the material of your hands.\nHowever, the energy does not need to touch the hands. It is sufficient to wave the hand about 1 inch away from the other hand. The energy is transferred from one hand to the other by waves.\nSOLUTION: Electrons do not touch the nucleus of an atom. Instead, electrons orbit the nucleus. The orbits are called discrete orbits because electrons do not orbit closer to the nucleus than their orbits.\nModels of electrons orbiting the nucleus can be based on waves. Electrons do not actually travel in waves. Instead, the orbits of electrons are often described using waves."}

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nThe energy from the motion of atoms, called thermal energy, can be transferred from one molecule to another by thermal bonds. Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the thermal bonds link more atoms together, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nHigh temperatures do not necessarily mean that a matter gets hot faster. A matter can get hot faster at low temperatures. This is because there are more thermal bonds between atoms at higher temperatures. So, a matter can have a higher temperature and get hot faster.\nA heat engine is a machine that uses thermal energy to do work. Overall, heat engines are more efficient when run at high temperatures. At high temperatures, there are more thermal bonds in the matter. So, the matter can do more work before it cools."}

This process releases a large amount of energy.\nWhen a uranium nucleus undergoes fission, the energy released is primarily in the form of kinetic energy of fission fragments. The fragments are the two smaller nuclei that are formed when the uranium nucleus splits.\nThe fragments have a lot of kinetic energy because they are moving a lot. This kinetic energy is what causes fission fragments to be radioactive.\nGamma radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation. It is released when an atom's nucleus becomes unstable. The nucleus emits radiation, and the radiation can be emitted from the atom as gamma radiation.\nAn atom of a nonradioactive element has not become unstable. So, gamma radiation is not primarily released in the form of gamma radiation.\nNeutrons are subatomic particles that are found in the nucleus of an atom. Neutrons can be emitted when an atom's nucleus becomes unstable.\nThe neutrons do not directly release energy into the atmosphere. But they can be absorbed by other atoms.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\nSOLUTION: When water changes state to steam, a change of state occurs. So, the water changes state from liquid to gas.\nThe water changes from a liquid to a gas, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed. So, the energy is not changed to a different form.\nThe energy is released by the water."}

Some of the most important laws of physics are those that describe the behavior of electric charges.\nOhm\u2019s law, named after Georg Simon Ohm, states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor.\nV = I \u00d7 R\nWhere V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.\nFaraday\u2019s law, named after Michael Faraday, states that a change in a magnet\u2019s magnetic field produces an electromotive force (EMF) in a nearby conductor.\nThe EMF is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field.\nElectromotive force is a measure of the tendency of a circuit to drive a current. It is similar to the pressure in a container, which is a measure of the tendency of a fluid to move.\nIf the pressure in a container is higher, the fluid will be forced through a smaller opening at a higher speed.\nIn a circuit, an EMF with a higher magnitude will drive a current with a higher magnitude through a conductor with a higher resistance.\nA higher magnitude of EMF is similar to a higher pressure in a container. It is associated with a higher magnitude of current through a conductor with a higher resistance.\nCoulomb\u2019s law, named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, states that the force between two charges is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charges.\nThe greater the magnitude of the charges, the more strongly the charges attract or repel each other.\nNewton\u2019s laws, also known as the laws of motion, describe the relationship between a object\u2019s mass and its acceleration.\nAn object\u2019s mass tells you its resistance to acceleration. An object with more mass will not accelerate as quickly as an object with less mass.\nSOLUTION: Metal detectors work by detecting changes in the magnetic field around metal objects. When a metal object is present, it disturbs the ground around it. This disturbance shows up in the magnetic field.\nMetal detectors use a coil to measure the magnetic field.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.\nSOLUTION: Sound is a wave. Like other waves, sound can travel through gases. So, sound travels in gases."}

When water changes into a gas, the gas bubbles up as a boil.\nThe process of boiling water tends to warm the water. But the temperature of the water does not keep increasing. After the water boils, the bonds in the water's molecules are broken. The water then gets rid of energy and gets cooler."}

This gradient is caused by the earth's core emitting heat into the surrounding mantle.\nSome earthquakes are caused by tidal friction, or the resistance that the earth's crust encounters as it moves through space. During a full or a new moon, the gravitational pull of the moon and sun combine to create tidal friction, which can cause earthquakes.\nSOLUTION: The principle source of earth's internal energy is radioactivity. Radioactivity is the process of emitting radiation from the nucleus of an atom. This radiation can be in the form of waves, such as x-rays or gamma rays, or it can be particles, such as neutrons.\nThe energy of the radiation can be used to heat the earth's interior. This heating effect is called geothermal heat.\nGravitational pressure is not a source of Earth's internal energy. Although the pressure is great, it does not change significantly.\nTidal friction is not a source of Earth's internal energy. Although tidal friction can cause earthquakes, the energy it releases is not stored for long periods."}
