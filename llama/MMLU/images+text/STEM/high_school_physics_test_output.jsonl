So, its acceleration is zero at that instant.\nThe ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nThe ball takes more time to travel to the highest point than to fall back down. This is because the ball is moving downward faster than it is moving upward."}

The spring supports the block, and the block is made of metal. When the block is lifted from the table and released, it will fall back down. But because the spring resists flexing, the block will not fall back down to the table directly. Instead, the block will fall back down and hit the table with a certain amount of force. This is called an oscillation.\nThe amplitude of an oscillation is a measure of the distance from the center of the oscillation to the point where the spring-block system is currently located.\nSOLUTION: When the second block falls on the first block, the combined mass is made up of two equal parts. The combined mass is stuck together after the second block falls. So, the system is made up of a single mass that is stuck to the spring.\nThe spring will still resist flexing, and the mass will still fall back down. But now, the mass is stuck to the spring. So, the distance from the center of the oscillation to the point where the spring-block system is currently located is zero.\nThis means that the amplitude of the oscillations is zero."}

The power of light increases as the intensity of the light increases.\nThe intensity of light is inversely proportional to the distance between the light and the area it strikes.

The period is equal to 1/the frequency.\nThe frequency is equal to the inverse of the period. So, the frequency is equal to 1/period.\nThe frequency tells you how often the object swings back and forth in a unit of time. For example, if the frequency is 0.5 swings per second, the object will swing back and forth once every second.\nA lower frequency means that the object takes longer to swing back and forth. So, decreasing the period of the pendulum will decrease its frequency.\nSOLUTION: Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released decreases the height that the ball must move up to return to its starting position. This height is part of the energy that the ball uses to keep swinging. So, by decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released, you decrease the period of the pendulum.\nIncreasing the mass of the ball increases the ball's resistance to swinging. So, the period of the pendulum increases.\nDecreasing the length of the string decreases the distance that the ball must travel to complete one swing.

The formula for angular velocity is \u03c9 = \u03b4t^2. The formula for distance traveled is d = \u03c9 \u00d7 t.\nThe disk's angular velocity is changing over time.

Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If the object is moving, the force can do work. The amount of work a force does on an object depends on the force's magnitude and the distance over which the force acts.\nWhen a force does work on an object, the object's kinetic energy increases. The object's kinetic energy is determined by its mass and speed. So, the amount of work a force does on an object also affects the object's speed.\nA force can also do work by moving an object upward against a force of gravity. When this happens, the object's potential energy increases. The object's potential energy is determined by its mass and the height at which it is located. So, the amount of work a force does on an object also affects the object's height.\nSOLUTION: The rubber band winds and unwinds around the axle supporting the wheels. This winds up the rubber band, storing potential energy in it. When the rubber band uncoils, it transfers energy to the cart, giving it more kinetic energy.\nDepending on how the rubber band is initially wound, more or less potential energy can be transferred to the cart. So, the distance the cart goes up the ramp depends on how the rubber band is wound.\nThe normal force on the cart's wheels will be different depending on how much the rubber band winds or unwinds. But this force does not explain why the cart does not go a consistent distance up the ramp.\nHow much energy is transferred from kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy depends on the vertical height at which the cart ends up. But this height does not explain why the cart does not go a consistent distance up the ramp.\nSome of the cart's initial kinetic energy will be dissipated due to work done by friction.

This means that the objects bounce off each other. The kinetic energy of an elastic collision is conserved.\nA collision is inelastic when the objects do not bounce off each other. This means that the objects stick together after the collision. The kinetic energy of an inelastic collision is not conserved.\nSOLUTION: The ice skaters are moving in different directions at different speeds. When they collide, their ice skates stick together. But which way do the ice skaters go after the collision? To find this out, consider the direction the ice skaters were moving before the collision. The 50-kg ice skater was moving west.

Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.\nSOLUTION: A beam of monochromatic light is a beam of light with a single frequency. (The term monochromatic means \"one color.\" )\nA beam of monochromatic light entering a glass window pane from the air will experience a change in speed. But the frequency and wavelength of the light will not change.\nThe speed of the light outside the window is 299,792,458 meters per second. This is much faster than the speed of the light inside the window. So, the light slows down when it enters the window.\nBut the light still has a wavelength of about 600 nanometers.

The larger the temperature difference and the greater the area of contact, the greater the rate of heat transfer.\nHeat is transferred through the rod by convection. Convection is the movement of a liquid or gas from a region of high temperature to a region of low temperature. In a cylindrical rod, convection occurs along the length of the rod.\nThe rate of heat transfer along the rod depends on the temperature difference between the two ends of the rod. The larger the temperature difference, the greater the rate of heat transfer. Since the temperature difference varies from 10\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C, the rate of heat transfer along the rod will vary accordingly.\nThe area of the rod is a fixed value. It does not change. So, the length of the rod is the only geometric factor that affects the rate of heat transfer along the rod.\nSOLUTION: Look for the geometric factor that affects the temperature difference between the two ends of the rod. The length of the rod affects the temperature difference between the two ends of the rod. When the temperature difference is 20\u00b0C, the length of the rod is the same as when the temperature difference is 10\u00b0C. So, the length of the rod is the only geometric factor that affects the rate of heat transfer along the rod."}
