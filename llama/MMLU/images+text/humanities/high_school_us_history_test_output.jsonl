It is also the idea that immigration should be limited or restricted.\nNativism has a long history in the United States. Some of the earliest expressions of nativism can be found in the responses of early American colonists to native people.\nLater, in the 1800 s and 1900 s, waves of immigrants from Europe were met with nativist sentiment.\nAlien Act of 1798: The first federal law dealing with immigration, the Alien Act of 1798, became law in response to concern about the French revolution. The act gave the president power to deport aliens who were deemed dangerous to the government.\nIn 1800, Congress passed the Alien Sedition Act, which extended the power to deport aliens to the president and made it a crime to make false statements against the government.\nBoth of these acts were repealed in 1802.\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965: This act was designed to reunite families and also to admit new immigrants on the basis of their skills or qualifications. The act removed the National Origins quotas, which had been used to limit immigration from particular countries.\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 also created a new classification for a \"special immigrant,\" which could be granted to a person who was deemed to have been helpful to the United States. This provision was included because of a desire to admit more people like Albert Einstein.\nThe Wagner Act of 1935: This act gave workers the right to organize unions and to engage in collective bargaining. The law did not address immigration directly, but it did help to improve working conditions for many Americans.\nThe Espionage Act of 1917: This act was passed during World War I. It made it a crime to oppose the war effort or to give aid to the enemy. The act was used to arrest and prosecute people who opposed the war, including many immigrants.\nSOLUTION: The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 is the closest example of nativism. This act had a clear bias against immigrants from eastern and southern Europe."}

The Confederacy saw the preservation of slavery as a major reason for seceding.\nBritain and France were considering recognizing the Confederacy as a separate country in 1862 and 1863.

Instead, it left the issue to be dealt with by laws that were already in place. At the time, many of the northern states had laws in place that would gradually abolish slavery. The southern states, on the other hand, had laws that would keep slavery in place.\nIn the years after the ratification of the Constitution, the northern and southern states continued to debate the issue of slavery.

Presidents may also use speeches to rally public support for a particular course of action.\nSOLUTION: Look at the underlined text.\nThe 1980s have been born in turmoil, strife, and change. This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we will not fail.\nCarter discussed the challenges faced by the United States and called for Americans to face these challenges together. He did not say that the United States would definitely defeat the Soviet Union and its allies or that he would definitely defeat incumbent President Ronald Reagan in the upcoming election."}

In the 1840 s, Anthony began publishing a newspaper, The Revolution, to promote equal rights for women.\nIn the 1860 s, a woman named Elizabeth Cady Stanton organized the first women's rights convention, which was held in Seneca Falls, New York. Stanton's Declaration of Sentiments, modeled after the Declaration of Independence, listed the grievances of women and demanded equality with men.\nIn the 1890 s, the women's rights movement re-emerged with a greater focus on women's suffrage, or the right to vote. This Suffrage movement was successful in gaining the right to vote for some women, but it was not until 1920 that women could vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment.\nSOLUTION: The Married Women's Property Act, passed in 1848, was intended to recognize a change in the roles of women in society. The act said that a woman's property would no longer be controlled by her husband. Instead, the property would be controlled by the woman herself.\nThis change was an important step towards the legal recognition of women's equality. In the 1800 s, men and women were not considered equal before the law. During the 1800 s, reformers began to work for women's rights.

The colonists' desire for self-rule and the idea that government should be established by a written constitution were not new. They had been discussed by colonial leaders for decades.\nHowever, it was not until the British government began to interfere with colonial government that many colonists began to think about government in a more formal sense. For example, in 1750, Benjamin Franklin, a colonial governor, proposed that the colonies work together on a project. He wrote, \"In some cases, it would be useful for the different colonies to be under a federal government.\" The word federal means a government in which power is divided between a central authority and smaller regional governments.\nNearly 30 years later, in 1787, a convention of representatives from each state met in Philadelphia to discuss how to make the central government more effective. The convention included James Madison, who had just finished writing a document known as the Virginia Plan. The Virginia Plan called for a strong central government with a chief executive, a judiciary, and a bicameral, or two-chambered, legislature.\nThe convention debated many issues before finally producing the Constitution of the United States. It was then sent to the states for ratification, or approval. When the Constitution was ratified in 1788, it created a strong central government based on the principles of federalism and representative democracy.\nSOLUTION: Andrew Hamilton's success in the Zenger case most directly reflects the American colonists' long tradition of self-rule.\nIn his closing argument, Hamilton argued that Americans were entitled to complain when they were hurt and that it was the cause of liberty. His argument demonstrated that Americans were not willing to submit to abuses of power by the British government. In fact, the American desire for independence from Great Britain was a direct result of British attempts to exercise too much control over the colonies."}

I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves. But again, I stand on my statement that I think that libertarianism and conservatism are traveling the same path.\"\nRonald Reagan, Interview published in Reason magazine, 1975\nWhich of the following groups would be most opposed to the sentiments expressed in the excerpt above?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Neoconservatives"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reagan Democrats"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Progressive Liberals"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Populists"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A political party is a group of people who share the same ideas about how government should work. Parties are the building blocks of our political system.\nThere are many political parties in the United States. Some of the major parties are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Other parties are called smaller parties or third parties.\nWhat do the different political parties believe?\nThe beliefs of political parties are called their platforms. The platforms of the major parties in the United States are usually more complex than the platforms of smaller parties.\nSome of the issues that the platforms of major parties address are:\nEconomic issues: Major parties in the United States usually have platforms that address economic issues, such as taxes, government spending, and regulation.\nSocial issues: Major parties in the United States usually have platforms that address social issues, such as education, the environment, and health care.\nInternational issues: Major parties in the United States usually have platforms that address international issues, such as war and peace, trade, and immigration.\nThe platform of a party can be as long as 100 pages. It is not practical to put a party's entire platform in a multiple-choice question. So, questions about a party's platform may refer to a shorter statement of the party's positions.\nIn the 1970s, President Ronald Reagan said that he believed that conservatism and libertarianism were \"traveling the same path.\" This means that he believed that the two ideologies were very similar.\nConservatism and libertarianism are both ideologies. An ideology is a set of beliefs about how government should work.\nSome of the differences between conservatism and libertarianism are:\nConservatism emphasizes traditional values and a limited role for government.\nLibertarianism emphasizes individual freedom and a small role for government."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Those whose condition is such that their function is the use of their bodies and nothing better can be expected of them, those, I say, are slaves of nature. It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Christopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: During the 15th and 16th centuries, many Europeans believed that it was their duty to spread their culture and religion to other parts of the world. Christopher Columbus, an Italian, was one of these people. In 1492, he sailed west across the Atlantic Ocean on behalf of the Spanish monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella. His goal was to find a new trade route to the Indian Ocean.\nColumbus reached land on October 12, 1492, and he believed that he had reached the East Indies, or what we now call India. Over the next several years, Columbus made three more voyages to the Americas. In 1499, the Spanish crown appointed a second governor, Nicolas de Ovando, to the West Indies. Ovando was responsible for the torture and murder of many native people.\nBartolome de Las Casas, a Spanish priest who had come to the Americas in 1502, took up the cause of the native people. He argued that they should be treated with respect and that their lives should be spared. Las Casas believed that native people were survivors of the cataclysm that had destroyed Atlantis. He believed that the Spanish conquest of the Americas was a result of the wrath of the gods.\nSOLUTION: The following statement is most accurate: Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people.\nBy the late 15th century, the Spanish had developed a strong aversion to miscegenation, or interbreeding. As a result, Spanish explorers considered it beneath them to marry native people.\nThe African slave trade was not part of the initial wave of conquest. However, as the Spanish began to settle the Americas, they turned to slavery. At first, the Spanish enslaved native people. Later, they imported African slaves.\nChristopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America. Viking expeditions had reached North America in the 11th century.\nEarly native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation. Spanish explorers were among the first Europeans to see these native American crops."}

There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them.

Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.

But we do not have the right to resort to violence\u2014or the threat of violence\u2014when we don't get our way. Our founders constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear. Oklahoma City proved once again that without the law there is no freedom. Criticism is part of the lifeblood of democracy. No one is right all the time. But we should remember that there is a big difference between criticizing a policy or a politician and demonizing the government that guarantees our freedoms and the public servants who enforce our laws.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton, \"What We Learned in Oklahoma City,\" 2010\n(Written on the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing)\n\"If there would not have been a Waco, I would have put down roots somewhere and not been so unsettled with the fact that my government\u2026was a threat to me.

You need to read and analyze several documents to determine how events, actions, or ideas are related.\nHere are some tips to help you make inferences between documents:\nCompare the ideas presented in each document. Does each document support the same conclusion, or do the documents offer different perspectives on an event or issue?\nIdentify the similarities and differences between the documents. Are there any patterns or contradictions among the documents?\nDetermine where each document supports a claim. Are the claims introduced, supported by evidence, and concluded in the document?\nConsider the structure of the documents. Are the documents well-organized, and are their arguments logical?\nWatch for overly broad or vague claims. Are the claims overly broad, or do they oversimplify events or issues?\nDon't assume that all parts of a document are supported by evidence. Be careful not to overlook a claim that is not well-supported.\nSOLUTION: The excerpt from President Clinton's essay argues that criticizing the government is a healthy part of democracy. It also argues that violence and the threat of violence are not acceptable ways to express dissent.\nThe excerpt from McVeigh argues that the government was a threat to him. He suggests that the events at Waco and Ruby Ridge led him to believe that the government was a violent threat.\nThe excerpt from Representative Conyers argues that the government used abusive tactics at Waco. He suggests that the use of tear gas and other tactics could have led to the deaths of the children who died in the fire that ended the standoff.\nThe excerpt from Janet Reno's statement to Congress argues that the government had to use force to enforce its laws. She suggests that the use of force was not a first choice, but a last resort.\nInferences that are supported by the documents:\nAnti-government sentiment in the 1990 s was inspired by what many people perceived as government overreach.\nSome Americans in the 1990 s feared that the government was a threat to them.\nJanet Reno, the attorney general in 1993, ordered a raid on the Branch Davidian compound.\nAfter the Oklahoma City bombing, the government increased its use of force to enforce its laws.\nInferences that are not supported by the documents:\nThe government's raid on the Branch Davidian compound was a response to anti-government sentiment.\nJanet Reno resigned from office in part due to pressure from Representative Conyers."}

During the ratification of the Constitution, opponents of the document worried that the federal government might exercise too much power at the expense of the states. In response, supporters of the Constitution agreed to add the Bill of Rights, which would guarantee individual rights and preserve the power of the states.\nHowever, the debates over federal power and states' rights have persisted. During the 1960 s, for example, many African Americans argued that the federal government should take a more active role in protecting their civil rights. Some white Americans, however, believed that states' rights should supersede federal authority.\nSOLUTION: The passage by Martin Luther King Jr. argues that injustice in one place is a threat to justice everywhere. This shows that King saw the country as a single community and believed that the federal government should intervene to protect the rights of all Americans.

By 1870, the year after the war ended, the tracks had expanded to 52,000 miles.\nThe rail system had a number of effects on the United States. One of its major effects was to facilitate the expansion of markets. Farmers, for example, could sell their crops to buyers in distant cities. In addition, the railroads made it cheaper to ship goods across the country. As a result of these changes, the American economy became more efficient and productive."}

The reformers were inspired by the Christian faith to help those in need. The reformers' work led to the establishment of schools, hospitals, and prisons.\nIn the 1800 s, a more formal social reform movement began. It was led by people who were concerned about the problems of urban life. These reformers were influenced by the Second Great Awakening, which had led to an increased interest in personal self-improvement. Social reformers of the 1800 s worked to improve labor conditions, end slavery, and improve education.\nDuring the mid-1800 s, a new religious movement began. Many of its followers were women. Christian Science, as it came to be called, taught that matter was not real and that sickness was a mistake. Its founder, Mary Baker Eddy, believed that illness could be cured by prayer alone.\nFeminist Susan B. Anthony was born in 1820. In the 1840 s and 1850 s, she worked as a teacher and a nurse.

However, it was also a period of social unrest and change. The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the continuing presence of American troops in Vietnam triggered a conservative backlash against the liberalism of the earlier era.\nThe conservative response to this period of social change was to argue that the federal government was becoming too large and too involved in American lives. This concern for big government was a central part of the conservative movement of the time.\nThe liberal response to the period of social change was to argue that the federal government needed to do more to address social inequalities and to promote social justice. This concern for social justice was a central part of the liberal movement of the time.\nSOLUTION: Kennedy's statement reflects American confidence in a time of prosperity. Kennedy was proposing a new goal for the United States: to send astronauts to the moon.

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

At the time, the United States used a bimetallic standard, which means that it recognized both silver and gold as valid forms of money. The ratio of silver to gold was set at 15 to 1 in the Coinage Act of 1873. This means that for every 15 ounces of silver, one ounce of gold could be used as money.\nHowever, the value of silver was going up, while the value of gold was going down. This made the silver standard more generous than the gold standard. Many farmers and westerners favored a silver standard, because it would allow more silver money to come into circulation.

Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"If you analyze it I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism.

The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals.
