When an argument or claim introduces two parts, or branches, by contrasting them, it is using a disjunctive syllogism.\nA disjunctive syllogism occurs when two branches of an argument or claim contrast two possibilities. One of the possibilities is accepted, and the other is rejected.\nThe logician John Venn developed a method for determining whether a syllogism is valid. A syllogism is valid if the rules he established are followed.\nOne of Venn's rules is that the minor premise must accept one choice and reject the other. In other words, the minor premise must either reject all of the possibilities or accept exactly one choice.\nFor example, the minor premise of a valid disjunctive syllogism could be:\n\"The cake is on the table, or the cake is in the refrigerator.\"\nThis premise accepts one choice and rejects the other. The cake is accepted to be in only one place.\nAnother valid disjunctive syllogism could have the following minor premise:\n\"The flag is flying, or the flag is drooping.\"\nThis premise rejects both choices. The flag is drooping.\nA valid disjunctive syllogism must have a minor premise that accepts one choice or rejects all the choices.\nSOLUTION: The minor premise of a valid disjunctive syllogism must accept one choice or reject all but one choice.

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.\nEquivocation is a type of logical fallacy in which a word or phrase is used in more than one way.\nWhen the Dean says that he'd guess about one in a hundred, he is using the phrase one in a hundred in two different ways. He uses it to describe the ratio of students to faculty, and he uses it to describe his estimate of the ratio. So, the Dean's statement is ambiguous.\nA strong argument does not use words in multiple ways.\nThe Dean could resolve the ambiguity by using different phrases to describe the ratio of students to faculty and his estimate of the ratio.\nFallacy of Division is a type of logical fallacy in which an argument or claim misrepresents the issues at hand by assuming that what is true for each member of a group is also true for the group as a whole.\nThe Dean's argument depends on the assumption that one student in a hundred is similar to ninety-nine students not in trouble. However, the students not in trouble are not similar to the student who is in trouble. So, the Dean's argument is a fallacy of division.\nA strong argument does not make assumptions about groups that are similar to the group as a whole only because the group as a whole is true for some of its members.\nDenying the Antecedent is a type of logical fallacy in which a strong argument is misrepresented as a weak argument.\nThe Dean's argument could be misrepresented as a weak argument that claims that no student is in trouble. However, the Dean's argument is actually a strong argument that claims that only one student is in trouble. So, the Dean's argument is not a denying the antecedent fallacy.\nAppeal to Nature is a type of logical fallacy that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice.\nThe Dean's argument could be an appeal to nature fallacy. However, the choice between one in a hundred and ninety-nine in a hundred is not a choice between natural and unnatural choices. So, the Dean's argument is not a appeal to nature fallacy.\nAuthority is a type of logical fallacy in which an argument or claim misrepresents the issues at hand by appealing to a supposed authority on a subject rather than providing evidence.\nThe Dean's argument could be a appeal to authority fallacy. However, the Dean is not claiming that a supposed authority says that there is one student in a hundred with academic trouble. So, the Dean's argument is not a appeal to authority fallacy."}

Over the past century, our understanding of the universe has changed dramatically. The science of cosmology has shown that the universe is not static and unchanging. Rather, it is dynamic and changing. Confronted with this evidence, we must reassess the traditional view of divine creation.\nThe guide of the perplexed explains that God exists alone, and nothing else. After creating the universe, God is not now involved in the universe's ongoing existence.\nThis view explains why the world appears to be in flux. If God is not now intervening in the universe, then the changes we observe are not miracles. Instead, they are part of the natural order that God established when He created the universe.\nThis view also addresses the problem of evil. Evil is not a consequence of God's actions. Rather, it is a consequence of the way God created the world.\nMoses Maimonides argues that, because God exists alone, He is unchanging. So, the world that best reflects God's unchanging nature is the world that has the greatest permanence.\nSOLUTION: Maimonides argues that God created the world out of nothing. But creating something out of nothing is impossible. So, this view contains an inherent contradiction.\nThis view also argues that time is an accident of motion. But motion is not an accident of what is moved. Rather, motion and what is moved are created simultaneously. So, time cannot be an accident of motion.\nFinally, this view equivocates on the word create. When Maimonides argues that God created the world out of nothing, he is using the word create in its traditional sense. But when he argues that time is a created thing, he is using the word create in a different sense."}

But in many cases, what seems natural is not necessarily the healthiest or most sustainable choice. For example, appealing to nature would argue that a very sweet food is healthy because it is natural. However, a very sweet food may be unhealthy because it contains a lot of sugar.\nAppeals to authority can be dangerous, because the authority being appealed to may be wrong. This fallacy can be particularly seductive, because it is easy to assume that people who are experts in a field know more about it than the general public will ever understand. However, even experts can be wrong.\nPrejudicial language is language that insults or demeans a group of people. Words can be hurtful, and they can also be used to manipulate public opinion.\nSOLUTION: The passage argues that appropriate technology is the best technology. It supports this claim with a brief anecdote about a conference on appropriate technology. The passage does not necessarily prejudice the reader against the other three categories of technology. Therefore, the question does not ask you to discuss an issue that is prejudiced by the passage.\nThe passage argues that appropriate technology is the best technology. It appeals to the authority of an expert who disapproves of inappropriate technology. This is a valid argument.\nThe passage argues that appropriate technology is the best technology. It assumes that the reader knows what is meant by appropriate technology. This may not be a valid assumption.\nThe passage argues that appropriate technology is the best technology. It uses a joke to suggest that the reader should believe in appropriate technology. This is not necessarily a valid argument."}

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a fallacy. Fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.\nA fallacy may present irrelevant information:\nFallacy | Description\nad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent\nappeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice\nbandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice\ncircular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself\nguilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something\nred herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim\nA fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:\nFallacy | Description\nfalse causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other\nfalse dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist\nhasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence\nstraw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against\n\nSOLUTION: The choice of thankfulness isn't necessarily the issue. The issue is whether the person has a right to be angry. The fallacy is a false consolation, which is a dismissive response that isn't actually comforting."}
