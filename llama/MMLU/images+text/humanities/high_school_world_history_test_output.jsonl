{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms."}, {"label": "B", "text": "can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India."}, {"label": "C", "text": "should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression."}, {"label": "D", "text": "seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: During the period of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries, many European powers built empires with a number of similar characteristics. One of the most important was the construction of a system of governance that concentrated power in a distant capital and then relied on a military or police force to maintain order.\nThis system was designed to extract resources from the colonized territory. In order to do this, it had to subvert the traditional power structures that had existed before the empire built its capital there. These traditional power structures included the landholding aristocracy, the clergy, and the market vendors.\nTo subvert these power structures, the European empires typically made laws that were different from the ones that had been in place before the empire built its capital. For example, the European empires often made laws that required people to pay taxes to the empire. These laws were designed to extract resources from the colonized territory.\nThe European empires also made laws that changed the traditional balance of power within the society. For example, the European empires often made laws that gave certain groups of people special privileges. These groups might include not only the empire's own citizens but also selected indigenous people. The empires did this in order to undermine the traditional aristocracy and to create a new hierarchy of power that could be controlled by the empire.\nThe European empires used the military or police to enforce their laws. They often recruited people from the colonized territory to be in these forces. This policy had two purposes. First, it helped to subvert the traditional power structures: people who joined the military or police were likely to be motivated by the desire to gain power and resources. Second, by recruiting people from the colonized territory, the European empires created a force that was loyal to the empire, not to the traditional structures of power.\nSOLUTION: The second passage suggests that the Cawnpore Massacre was the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy. This theory is consistent with the observation that the rebels seemed to have planned the attack in advance.\nThe passage also mentions that the violence was motivated by a desire to revenge the death of a local ruler. This was a powerful motivation. The British had put the ruler in prison, and he died there.\nHowever, the passage does not discuss the extent to which the violence was justified. The first passage suggests that the violence was not justifiable. According to the first passage, the Cawnpore Massacre was the result of an uprising of Indian sepoys against British rule."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

He was concerned that the polarization between the rich and poor peasants would become worse day by day if this trend was not stopped. Therefore, he argued that agriculture had to be collectivized in order to eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside. By collectivizing agriculture, Mao believed that all the rural people would become increasingly well off together."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nWhile some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive war\u2026 most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them.

Some historical assumptions are so commonly held that they are taken for granted. These assumptions can be strong enough to shape how people think about the past.\nMany people assume that the Middle Ages were characterized by war, disease, and famine. These assumptions are not entirely false, but they are also not entirely true. Most people did not live in towns. Most people were not nobles. But most people did not die in war, disease, or famine.\nThe assumptions people hold about the past can shape how they think about the present. For example, if you believe that war is the natural state of humanity, then you might think that war is inevitable. Many people believe that the Middle Ages were a time of constant war. So, some people think that war is inevitable.\nSome historical assumptions are so strong that they are taken to be true without much thought. For example, many people assume that the United States is the most powerful country in the world. This assumption is sometimes called a dominant assumption.\nDominant assumptions are not necessarily true. They are just assumptions that are widely accepted. These assumptions can be challenged. For example, some people might argue that the United States is not the most powerful country in the world. Other countries may have more powerful economies or armies.\nPeople can change their assumptions. Over the past few decades, many people have stopped assuming that men are naturally more intelligent than women. Other assumptions, such as the idea that war is necessary for human progress, are more difficult to change.\nSOLUTION: This historical assumption tends to support the idea that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era:\nIbn Khaldun, a pioneer in the field of sociology, stated that the Prophet Muhammad had taught that jihad was the main factor in the development of the Islamic community.\nIbn Khaldun lived in the fourteenth century. He is often called the founder of modern sociology.\nThis passage, from the Bahr, a book written in the 1150 s or 1160 s, supports the assumption that most Muslim rulers were required to prosecute the jihad to bring about the victory of Islam.\nEven Christian merchants were not stopped or hindered in Muslim territories, which suggests that most Muslims were not interested only in protecting their own territory.\nThis assumption is not true. It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion\u2026.The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months. On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.\nLet the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Killing of civilians during wartime"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Violence is a serious issue that has confronted societies for as long as history has been recorded.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich statement most accurately compares the Mongol (post-classical) empire with the Persian (classical) empire?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Mongols invested in building large-scale monuments, whereas the Persians focused on public works."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Empires are built by conquest, and during most of their histories, they are maintained by a powerful ruling class. Yet, all empires are changed by the peoples they conquer. These changes can take different forms.

The people over whom the ruling class governs might find inspiration in local traditions or in the customs of their conquerors. As a result of these pressures and temptations, empires change in different ways.\nWhen the Mongols conquered lands, they moved people and resources from those lands to other parts of the empire. This process, which was necessary for the Mongols to govern their empire, helped to spread ideas, cultures, and traditions throughout the empire. As a result, the Mongol empire was a cultural and social melting pot.\nCompare the Mongol empire with the Persian empire.\nBoth the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.\nThe Mongols did not always conquer lands by force. Sometimes, they made alliances with local rulers and did not impose Mongol rule. When the Mongols did conquer lands, they moved people and resources from those lands to other parts of the empire. This process helped to spread Mongol culture and tradition throughout the empire, but it did not erase the cultures of the conquered peoples.\nThe Persians, like the Mongols, did not always conquer lands by force.

Learning to distinguish between strong and weak evidence will help you assess the quality of the claims you read.\nConsequences of colonialism in Africa:\nColonialism was the process of taking control of weaker countries or areas. Extreme colonialism, such as the transatlantic slave trade, deportation, and forced labor, often had severe consequences for the people who were colonized. But even small colonial encounters could have long-term effects.\nHistorians look at colonialism from different angles. One way to do this is to compare colonialism to global imperialism.\nGlobal imperialism is the process of expanding a country's power and influence through the acquisition of weaker areas. Great empires, such as the Romans and the British, used global imperialism to gain control of many countries and areas.\nConquest of the Aztec Empire:\nIn 1519, Spanish explorer Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s led an expedition to Mexico. They arrived in Mexico in 1519, and by 1521, they had defeated the Aztec Empire.\nThe conquest of the Aztec Empire had many consequences. For example, the Spanish brought new diseases to the Americas, and the native populations suffered from them. Also, the Spanish forced the native population to convert to Christianity.\nThe conquest of the Aztec Empire was a major colonial encounter. But was it the \"quantum jump\" that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony?\nThe reformation of Catholic Christianity:\nThe reformation of Catholic Christianity was the process of changing Christianity. In the 1500 s, many Christians did not think that the pope, the bishop of Rome, was the religious authority. The reformation of Catholic Christianity created new Christian sects, or groups.\nThe reformation of Catholic Christianity had many consequences. For example, the reformation helped cause wars between Christian sects. These wars lasted for about 150 years.\nThe reformation of Catholic Christianity was a major change. But was it the \"quantum jump\" that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony?\nIsolationism of Tokugawa Japan:\nIn the 1600 s, the Japanese government closed Japan to most foreigners. The Japanese government also told Japanese people to stop traveling and living abroad.\nThe isolationism of Tokugawa Japan had many consequences. For example, Japan was able to avoid some diseases that afflicted other countries. But the isolationism also kept the Japanese from learning about new technologies and ideas.\nThe isolationism of Tokugawa Japan was a major change.

At that time, the automobile was just becoming widely used, and countries around the world were still largely rural. So, an event that happened at that time may have been much more important than an identical event that happens today.\nTo understand the historical context of a time period, you should identify the major issues and events that occurred during that period. You can then compare these things to other events to see how they are similar or different.\nSOLUTION: Look at the chart.\nThe chart shows the literacy rates of the Russian-speaking population between 1897 and 1955.\nLiteracy rates rose dramatically between 1926 and 1939. This period of rising literacy rates occurred during the time of the Soviet state under the leadership of Joseph Stalin. Stalin's centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization may help explain the rise in literacy rates.\nIn the years after World War II, the Soviet Union saw an explosion in post-secondary education. In 1955, the literacy rate among the Russian-speaking population was 99.90%. This period of rapid growth in post-secondary education may help explain why the literacy rate was so high in 1955.\nExperimentation with syndicalist forms of socio-economic organization was not widespread until after the Russian Revolution of 1917. So, the literacy rates shown in the chart are not a result of syndicalist forms of socio-economic organization.\nEducational reform in the modern era was not centralized and state-directed. So, the literacy rates shown in the chart were not a result of educational reform in the modern era.\nSecond-stage industrialization in the non-Western world is a historical process that involved the expansion of manufacturing and the growth of second-stage industries. Second-stage industrialization began in countries such as Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa in the 1960 s. So, second-stage industrialization in the non-Western world was not responsible for the rise in literacy rates shown in the chart."}

They used his parts to form the different castes. The hymn says that Brahman (the priests) were created from Purusa's mouth, Rajanya (the warriors) from his arms, Vaisya (the merchants and farmers) from his thighs, and Sudra (the servants) from his feet.\nHowever, the caste system is not directly mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, the ethical and practical advice given by Krishna to Arjuna.

Movements may arise because thinkers find that they have insights that are similar in various ways.\nA series of related positions may make up a movement. For example, the philosophers who were part of the Enlightenment may have had a number of different specializations, but they all shared a commitment to the importance of reason and the scientific method.\nA movement may also be defined by its opposition to another set of views. For example, existentialism was in part a response to the philosophical system of Hegel.\nExistentialism is a philosophy of personal responsibility. Existentialists believe that individuals must create meaning in their own lives. They reject the idea that there are any objective standards that can tell people how to live.\nExistentialism was most strongly developed by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. Sartre's main concern was the problem of individual freedom. He argued that people are free to choose their own values and actions, but that this freedom also comes with a heavy responsibility. Camus was more interested in the idea that life may not have a meaning that can be easily understood.\nReligious fundamentalism is a movement that is not associated with any specific philosopher or philosophy. It is a movement that is characterized by a strict adherence to a particular set of religious beliefs. Fundamentalism tends to reject new ideas and interpretations of a religion that are not in keeping with the fundamentalist's understanding of the religion.\nNew age syncretism is a movement that is not associated with any specific philosopher or philosophy. It is a movement that is characterized by the belief that a variety of different systems of thought can be harmoniously combined.\nLiberation theology is a movement that is not associated with any specific philosopher or philosophy. It is a movement that is focused on the relationship between religion and politics. Liberation theologians believe that the role of religion is to help bring about social change.\nSOLUTION: The author of the passage argues that it is impossible for him to know a meaning of life that transcends his condition.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nThe political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The passage argues that it is better to be feared than loved because fear is more sustainable and reliable than love.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Purusa-Sukta\"\nPurusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds.

These gods are kept alive by the sacrifices and rituals of humans. Because humans participate in the universe, Hindus believe that they can contribute to the continuation of the universe.\nThe passage suggests that the gods created human beings to help them.

They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers.

Cultural differences can sometimes lead to miscommunication or confusion.\nPeople in different cultures may have different ideas about what is polite or impolite, what is normal or unusual, or what is right or wrong. These ideas can be different from person to person within a culture.\nSome cultural differences are easy to understand. For example, it is impolite to use a swear word to a person's face in some cultures, but in others, it is just as impolite to fail to use swear words in a heated argument.\nOther cultural differences are not so easy to understand. For example, in some cultures, it is important to maintain a distance between people in public, while in others, it is important to maintain a close physical proximity.\nSOLUTION: The men in the culture Ibn Battuta observed in Mali in the 1300 s were Muslims who kept to the prayers, studied fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and learned the Qur'an by heart. They also had close friendships with women outside the prohibited degrees of marriage.\nThis suggests that the veil was not an important part of their religion.

This has happened often in world history, and many colonized people have resented being controlled by their colonizers.\nThe British empire is an example of a colonial empire. It began in the late 1700 s and lasted for many years.\nThe people of the colonies were not represented in the British government. The British government did not give the colonists equal rights. In fact, the British government often made laws that were specifically designed to benefit English people and restrict colonists.\nFor example, the Sugar Act was a British law that imposed new taxes on sugar imported to the colonies. The law was designed to benefit the British sugar industry.\nThe Stamp Act was a British law that taxed all paper goods, including newspapers. The money raised by the tax was to be spent by the British government.\nThe colonists very much resented being governed in this way. They did not have any say in the laws that were passed. And the laws were often designed to hurt the colonists.\nMany colonized people also suffered from the loss of land. Land was taken away from them, and they were forced to move.

These trading posts were places where Europeans could trade with Africans. The trading posts were part of the establishment of Portuguese trading stations.\nThe consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa was also under way.

The first Spanish officials to arrive in the New World believed that the native populations could be ruled under the same systems that had been used in Spain. However, subsequent Spanish viceroys and colonial officials came to believe that the natives were not interested in adopting Spanish ways. In the late 1500 s, Spanish officials began to implement policies that were more just to the natives of the New World.\nThese changes were partly a response to the practices described in the passage. The passage suggests that the mine owners were using unpaid Indian labor and were torturing and killing Indians. These practices were widespread throughout the Spanish colonies. Many Spanish colonial officials were concerned about the mistreatment of natives, and they argued that such treatment was not good business. Indentured servants and African slaves were both more expensive than unpaid Indian labor, but Spanish colonial officials began to import more African slaves in response to the concerns about Indian treatment.\nSOLUTION: The passage suggests that the mine owners were not paying their Indian laborers and were forcing them to work on the mines under threat of punishment. These practices were harmful to the natives, and the passage argues that they were widespread throughout the Spanish colonies. The passage also argues that these practices were hidden from Spanish colonial officials.\nIn response to the practices described in the passage, the Spanish Crown promulgated royal decrees insisting on more humane treatment of the natives. These royal decrees were part of a broader effort to make the colonial administration more just.\nThe passage does not directly address the other changes.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nRodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The importation of New World products into Africa"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: During the period 1450 to 1750, the world experienced significant cultural, economic, and territorial changes. Some of the changes were related to the global spread of long-distance trade, the growth of empires, and the forced movement of people.\nSome aspects of these changes were influenced by new technology, including the compass, the astrolabe, and the printing press. Other changes were related to the expansion of trade networks and the growth of empires.\nOne major change was the global spread of Christianity. Christian missionaries, or preachers, traveled to many parts of the world, including Africa and the New World. They preached the teachings of Jesus Christ, and often worked to improve the social and economic conditions of their communities.\nThe African diaspora was the movement of African people out of Africa. Many African people were forced to leave Africa and move to the New World as part of the transatlantic slave trade.\nSOLUTION: Rodney argues that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation. The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa does not address how European capitalists came to exploit Africa. The importation of New World products into Africa was not an exchange between equals. The African diaspora was a forced movement of people, not an exchange of resources. And the colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers was the result of the imperialist system."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty.

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

Different religious authorities could issue contradictory rulings, and which authorities were accepted as authoritative could vary among groups.\nThis flexibility could lead to different interpretations of religious obligations. For example, the obligation to participate in a crusade was not a clear duty for Christians in the Middle Ages. Christian theorists argued about whether the Bible obligated Christians to help other Christians under attack.\nSome theorists argued that the duty was not clear. For them, the Bible did not offer a clear example of a Christian community sending assistance to another Christian community under attack.\nOther theorists argued that the duty was clear. For them, the Bible contained multiple examples of assistance and rescue.\nIn the 12th century, the Church used its authority to issue a ruling that a crusade was a religious duty. A ruler who did not go on a crusade could be excommunicated.\nThe ruling was issued in response to appeals from the Byzantine emperor, who was fighting to reclaim Anatolia from the Turks. The Byzantine emperor had appealed to the pope for help, arguing that the Christians were under attack.

A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind.

To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nWhich of the following resources would the author of the second passage have been most likely interested in obtaining from local natives?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ivory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tobacco"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Silver"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Furs"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: During the 16 th and 17 th centuries, European countries established trading companies to profit from the trade of goods and resources.\nThe Dutch established the Dutch East India Company.

In addition to trading, the companies were also involved in the administration of the areas where they had their forts.\nIn order to maintain control over the areas and the people who lived there, the companies relied on local leaders who were already in power.

Their development often involves a process of building upon earlier ideas.\nThe ancient Greeks developed the concept of natural law. Natural law was the idea that there are certain laws that are common to all humans. These laws are not laws in the sense of rules passed by a legislature. They are not laws in the sense of rules made by a government. Instead, they are laws in the sense of fundamental principles.\nThey are laws that are known by all humans. They are laws that are obvious to all humans. They are laws that are accepted by all humans.\nThe ancient Greeks did not write about the idea of natural law as we understand it today. But their ideas about justice and fairness were important steps in the development of this concept.\nIn the same way, the ideas of one philosopher often build on the ideas of other philosophers.\nMarxism is a more recent philosophical idea. It builds on the ideas of Marx and Engels.\nMarx and Engels believed that the nature of work matters. It matters, they believed, to how a society functions.\nThey believed that as technology advances, the value of a particular type of work tends to go down. So, for example, the work of a farmer tends to be less valuable than the work of a doctor.\nBut the wages for a type of work do not always go down when the value of that work goes down. This means that the wages for some types of work may be too high, and the wages for other types of work may be too low.\nWhen the wages for a type of work are too high, the prices of goods and services will be too high. When the wages for a type of work are too low, the prices of goods and services will be too low.\nMarx and Engels believed that these problems would get worse over time. They believed that the only way to fix these problems was to change the way society is organized.\nThey believed that a socialist society would be a fairer society. In a socialist society, the means of production would be owned by the workers. The workers, not capitalists, would get the money from the sale of goods and services.\nIn the long run, Marx and Engels believed, a socialist society would be a classless society. There would be no capitalists or workers. There would only be people.\nPhilosophical ideas often evolve in response to other philosophical ideas. Marxism was no exception.\nFascism was a philosophical idea that emerged in the 20th century. Fascism involves a strong central government that uses its power to promote the interests of a single group.\nMercantilism is an economic idea. Mercantilism involves the belief that a nation should export more than it imports. Mercantilism also involves the belief that a nation should accumulate gold and silver.\nCapitalism is an economic idea. Capitalism involves the belief that a society should be organized around private ownership of the means of production.\nSOLUTION: The principal philosophical underpinning of Lenin's call to power was Marxism.\nMarxism is the idea that a socialist society would be a fairer society. In a socialist society, the means of production would be owned by the workers. The workers, not capitalists, would get the money from the sale of goods and services.\nAccording to Marxism, the only way to achieve a socialist society is to have a revolution. In the revolution, the workers must overthrow the capitalists. The workers must take control of the means of production.\nLenin believed that the time was ripe for a revolution. He believed that the workers must seize power. They must do this immediately. They must do this before the capitalists could organize a counter-revolution."}

In order to maintain a brisk trade, Portugal needed to supply high-value goods in exchange for the goods Kongo wanted. So, the first trade did not work well for Kongo.\nIn the second letter, King Afonso I of Kongo tells King John III of Portugal that the Portuguese often kidnap noblemen and other relatives.

It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes.

Some of these societies were considered more civilized than others. In this chapter, we examine the treatments of barbarians by civilized societies in this period.\nBarbarians were societies that were considered less civilized than the societies that were encountering them. These societies were often described by the Romans as violent and warlike. As a result, the Romans did not treat barbarians as equally civilized.\nThe treatment of barbarians by civilized societies in 600\u20131450 C.E. was similar in some ways to the treatment of barbarians by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E.\nIn both periods, civilized societies:\nconverted barbarians to their own religions\nutilized barbarians as soldiers\nimposed servile statuses on barbarians\nand invited barbarians to rule instead of their own ruling classes.\nHowever, in the period 600\u20131450 C.E., barbarians were increasingly considered uncivilized and were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies. This was different from the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., when barbarians were often assimilated and converted to the religions of their conquerors.\nSOLUTION: An invitation to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes is not a treatment of barbarians by civilized societies. In 600\u20131450 C.E., barbarians were not always invited to rule instead of the ruling classes.\nBarbarians were sometimes allowed to rule over other barbarians, but they were never allowed to rule over civilized people.\nThe laws of the Frankish kingdom, for example, made it clear that the kingdom's ruler, the king, was a civilized person. According to these laws, only the king and his warriors could be considered civilized people.\nAll other people, whether free people or slaves, were considered barbarians."}

It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them.

This relationship is not only a result of economic strength but also a cause. Economic power can be used to support powerful armies and to fund large governments, which can then be used to shape politics in a region.\nMany people believe that a country's economic development is its most important resource for achieving political power. A country's economy can provide the means to build a military, to assist other countries, and to pay for the administration of domestic and foreign affairs.\nSome of the main factors that contribute to economic development include education, technological innovation, infrastructure, and international trade.\nA country with a well-educated population is more likely to have a skilled workforce and be innovative. A country with a strong infrastructure is more likely to have efficient and sustainable economic growth. And a country with international trade is more likely to have a diversified economy and access to foreign resources.\nSOLUTION: Ibn Battuta's description of Aden provides evidence of limited economic opportunities in a medieval Islamic society. He writes that Aden is an exceedingly hot place, surrounded by mountains, and has no crops, trees, or water. However, Aden is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants.\nIbn Battuta's passage also provides evidence of the supremacy of piety among the inhabitants of Aden.

These exchanges involved peoples from many different parts of the world, including the Byzantines, the Islamic peoples, the Celts, and the Chinese.\nOne significant source of cultural exchange was the spread of written texts. For example, the Greek scientist Hippocrates wrote about medicine in the form of texts that were studied and passed on by generations of doctors. In the eleventh century, the Arab physician Ibn Sina wrote a book that was a comprehensive review of medicine up to that time. In the thirteenth century, the Italian physician Giovanni da Crema wrote a commentary on Ibn Sina's work.\nAnother source of cultural exchange was the movement of peoples and ideas along the Silk Road, a network of trade routes that extended from China to the Mediterranean. For example, the Chinese invented the compass, which was adopted by the Arabs and helped them expand their trade routes.\nYet another source of cultural exchange was the movement of peoples. For example, the Celts migrated throughout Europe, influencing the art and culture of the regions into which they moved.\nSOLUTION: The second passage illustrates the exchange of ideas from the Islamic world to Europe. Ibn Sina wrote about medicine in Arabic, but European scholars translated his works into Latin. These translations made Ibn Sina's ideas available to doctors in Europe.\nThe first passage illustrates the exchange of ideas from Mesoamerica to Europe. Europeans learned about Mesoamerican medicine through trade and the study of Mesoamerican civilizations."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.\"\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.\nWhich of the following correctly describes one of the primary reasons that Greek culture was disseminated widely around the Mediterranean region during the time period represented by the passage?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The geography of Greece contains many natural resources that facilitated a profitable mining industry."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The geography of Greece contains numerous freshwater lakes that facilitated a successful fishing industry."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The geography of Greece contains prominent river valleys that facilitated widespread agriculture."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The geography of Greece contains many natural harbors that facilitated trade and commerce."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": ""}

Some governments are unjust and harmful. A strong government may be able to do what it wants, but that does not mean it is doing what is right.\nMost people believe that the purpose of government is to secure the rights of its people. But how can this be done? In the past, many thinkers have believed that the best way to secure people's rights is to give more power to the government.\nOthers believe that the best way to secure people's rights is to limit the power of the government. In this view, if the government has less power, then it will not be able to do much harm. The idea that the government should be limited in its power is part of the United States Constitution. The Constitution is the highest law in the United States. It says that the government has only the power that is granted to it. If the government tries to exercise power that is not granted to it, then it is acting outside the law.\nSOLUTION: Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli lived in the 1500 s. At that time, Italy was not a unified country. Instead, it was a group of city-states that were often at war with each other.\nMachiavelli was interested in how political leaders could bring peace and stability to Italy.

This law was intended to limit the contact between Chinese and foreigners and to restrict foreign trade.\nThe Chinese could also restrict foreign trade by imposing tariffs. A tariff is a tax on goods as they cross the border. In the late 1700 s, the Chinese imposed an extraordinary tariff on foreign products. This tariff made foreign goods more expensive and limited the trade between China and other countries.\nThe Chinese could use other methods to restrict foreign trade. For example, in 1760, the Chinese emperor passed a law that made it illegal for Chinese subjects to trade with foreigners. This law made it difficult for European merchants to find locals who were willing to trade with them.\nSOLUTION: The Chinese imposed extraordinary tariffs on all foreign products.\nIn 1757, the Chinese emperor proclaimed that all foreigners were to be confined to the coastal cities of China.

These two countries competed in many ways, including by trying to spread their ideologies to other countries.\nWorld War I and World War II were wars between countries. During World War I, many empires collapsed. During World War II, the Allies and the Axis powers competed for control of the world.\nThe Scramble for Africa was a competition between European countries to see who could gain the most control over Africa. Many empires and colonies were established as a result of this competition.\nSOLUTION: The second paragraph mentions co-operation with all states that have a mixed economy. It does not mention competing empires or colonialism. It does not mention the competing ideologies of World War II or the Cold War. The only mention of a war is the Scramble for Africa. So, the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph refers to the Scramble for Africa."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nWhat traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: World history is a vast and complex field. It includes the study of many different societies, and it covers a time range of thousands of years. Consequently, it is not possible to remember all of the details about every society. In order to study world history, it is necessary to identify the most important trends and themes and to recognize the trade-offs and compromises that have been made.\nA traditional view of world history is that China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies. This view is based on centuries-old technological advances in Europe, such as the printing press and the steam engine, that were not made in China until much later. Furthermore, during the 18th and 19th centuries, China suffered a series of military defeats by more technologically advanced European nations.\nSome historians have challenged this traditional view. They note that before the 18th century, China was not necessarily behind Europe in technology. For example, China was the first to use paper, the compass, and gunpowder.\nOther historians have suggested that the traditional view is not that China was necessarily backward in technology, but that it was not as open to innovation as some other societies. For much of its history, China has been a highly centralized society. Its rulers have tried to maintain strict control over all aspects of society, including technology. This approach has both advantages and disadvantages. One disadvantage is that it can make a society less open to new ideas and technologies."}

They obtained profits based on the company's success. In this era, joint-stock companies were typically involved in shipping or shipping-related trade.\nLabor unions.\nA labor union is an organization of workers who share similar interests. In the mid-19th century, unions began to emerge in the United States. They fought for better wages and working conditions.\nZaibatsu groups.\nA zaibatsu is a powerful business group in Japan.
