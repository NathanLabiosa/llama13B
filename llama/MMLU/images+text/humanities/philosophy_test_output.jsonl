For example, almost everyone thinks that a sweet taste is pleasant. Other aesthetic judgments are culturally specific. For example, what is considered beautiful or attractive may differ between cultures.\nSOLUTION: Aesthetics deals with objects that are essential to our existence.\nWe have aesthetic judgments about many things, including everyday objects. For example, consider a hammer. Aesthetic judgments about a hammer could include its balance, its design, and the pleasure it brings to use."}

They often focus on potential issues with the evidence, rather than on the issue itself.\nNagel claims that most skeptical arguments are based on linguistic confusions. He means that the arguments often involve misunderstandings about the meanings of words that are central to the argument. For example, the word prove means to demonstrate without any possible doubt. However, in the context of scientific evidence, prove has a weaker meaning: to demonstrate with a high degree of probability. When skeptics demand that a claim be proved in the strict sense, they are likely to be mistaken."}

In political philosophy, theories take the form of narratives that describe the nature of the political world and the relationships between individuals and groups.\nThese narratives include an account of the origins of political power and the principles that guide the use of political power. They often include, too, an account of the nature of moral principles and the relationship between politics and economics.\nA theory can help you understand how the world could be. It can also help you evaluate whether the world is as it should be.\nImagine that you want to understand the nature of political power. One theory you could use is liberalism. Liberalism has an account of the origins of political power and the principles that guide the use of political power. It also has an account of the nature of moral principles.\nAccording to liberalism, the origins of political power are in the social contract. Individuals create a government by entering into a contract. In this contract, they agree to accept the benefits of society and to accept the responsibilities that come with those benefits. They agree to obey the laws that the government creates to maintain social order.\nLiberalism also tells you that the principles of justice are the foundation of the social contract. These principles tell you what is just and unjust. They include the principles of equality and freedom.\nEquality means that everyone should have the same rights. Freedom means that everyone should have the same opportunities.\nSOLUTION: To decide which answer choice is the most accurate, you need to understand the question. You need to understand what Rawls says about the original contract.\nRawls says that the original contract is the foundation of the social contract. It is the basis for the principles of justice. In the original contract, the parties agree to just terms of social cooperation.\nThe original contract is not the details of the society the parties enter. The original contract is the basis for the principles that guide the use of political power. It is not the details of the government the parties establish.\nSo, Rawls does not conceive of the original contract as setting up a particular form of government."}

They also try to work out what is necessary for particular kinds of things to be true. For example, they might ask whether we can know that other people are not just machines that can mimic human behavior. Or they might ask what it means to say that an object is beautiful.\nSome philosophers think that we should start with basic questions about the world. Other philosophers believe that we should start with basic questions about our experiences. Still, other philosophers think that basic questions arise from our attempts to understand and talk about the world.\nIn recent years, philosophers have also discussed how our practices and institutions can make a difference to what we can do. For example, we can learn to do many things, including riding a bicycle and speaking a language. And when we learn, we are not just changing our knowledge, but also our practices and our institutions.\nSOLUTION: Anscombe's claim is that it is not profitable to do moral philosophy until we have an adequate philosophy of: religion.\nMost of the questions that come up in moral philosophy concern what we do or should do. But what we do or should do might not always be right or wrong. Instead, what we do or should do might be made right or wrong by our beliefs about what is divine. So, if Anscombe is correct, we need a philosophy of religion before we can do moral philosophy."}

A position is fair when it is just.\nSo, the term \u201cjustice as fairness\u201d conveys the idea that the principles of justice are agreed to in an initial position that is fair. Rawls uses the word \u201cjustice\u201d to refer to the principles of justice.

Instead, he believed that pleasure was a sense of contentment and satisfaction.\nEpicurus did not think that the best life was one that involved fighting and struggling. Instead, he thought that the best life was one that was free of trouble and worry. So, he claimed that the virtue of courage was not about being willing to die for a cause. Instead, it was about not feeling any trouble or worry.\nEpicurus also thought that the same was true for justice. Just as it is not just to take more than your fair share, it is also unjust to worry about what other people think of you.\nTemperance and prudence are similar. They both involve controlling your desires and living a moderate life. But temperance is more about controlling your desires for food and drink, while prudence is more about controlling your desires for material goods.\nSOLUTION: According to Epicurus, all other virtues spring from two basic virtues: temperance and prudence.

One of the main goals of practical rationality is to choose the best means to achieve a goal. So, practical rationality is about deliberation and decision making.\nThere are several possible justifications for practical rationality.\nMoral justification. One way to justify practical rationality is by referencing moral principles. For example, if it is morally wrong to ignore important facts, then practical rationality involves avoiding that misconduct.\nDeliberative justification. Another justification for practical rationality is based on the value of deliberation. Deliberation is generally considered to be a good thing, and so practical rationality, which is concerned with deliberation, is justified.\nEpistemic justification. A practical rational agent is someone who is trying to learn about the world and how to survive and thrive in it. Epistemic justification underwrites practical rationality by emphasizing the importance of gathering information and using it to make decisions.\nAn illusion. It is possible that practical rationality is an illusion. A person who believes in practical rationality may be seen as having an illusion.

A moral rule is a rule that an agent has for deciding what to do. It is genuine if it is based on the agent's values. An agent's values are the things that are important to her for their own sake.\nBaier claims that an agent's values are the only criteria for making a decision genuine. If an agent's values do not bear on the decision, then the decision is not a genuine moral rule. For example, an agent's desire to look good to others is not a value. It is a desire. A desire does not make a decision right or wrong. A genuine moral rule is a rule that an agent finds important for its own sake.\nIf a moral rule is not based on an agent's values, then it is not a genuine moral rule. It is not a genuine moral rule to follow a moral rule that others expect you to follow. It is not a genuine moral rule to follow a moral rule that you think will lead to a particular outcome.\nSome moral rules do not make right or wrong into a decision.

In order to do this, they must be able to keep track of the data they have collected. Keeping records is part of the process of analyzing data.\nIn order to keep records, researchers must first decide what data to record. They then need to organize and review the data. Finally, they need to share the data with other researchers, who may repeat the study or use the data to answer new questions.\nAll of these steps require that researchers handle the data with care. They must protect the data from being lost or damaged. They also must protect the privacy of the people who have provided the data.\nPrivacy means being able to keep some parts of your life to yourself. In social science research, privacy is especially important when the data being collected is about people.\nSome ways researchers protect participants' privacy include:\ndeleting all names and other identifying information\ncombining data with other data to hide the identities of individual participants\ncreating fictitious names for participants\nSOLUTION: It is important that personal data about research participants are kept within secure, confidential records because:\nin case individuals, places, or organizations can be harmed through identification or disclosure of personal information.\nThe consequences of disclosure can be harmful to the individuals, places, or organizations.\nSo that the participants cannot find out what has been written about them.\nParticipants have a right to privacy.\nTo enable the researcher to track down individuals and find out more about their lives.\nThe researcher wants to get in touch with the participants.\nGovernment officials, teachers, and other people in authority can have easy access to the data.\nThe data is supposed to be confidential."}

Cars that have all of these traits are included in the concept car.\nSome concepts are physical objects that you can touch or hold in your hands. Other concepts are abstract, which means that you cannot touch or see them.\nA set of objects, events, or ideas does not become a concept until you define it.

He did not fear death, but rather yearned for the end of life.\nEpicurus claimed that death is the end of all fears and worries. If death is the end of life, it is impossible to experience fear or worry during that state. So, if death is an illusion, then so is the fear of death. However, if death is not an illusion, then yearning for the end of life is not necessarily a wise attitude.\nSOLUTION: According to Epicurus, the wise man realizes that death is an illusion. Death is not an illusion, but the fear of death is. When we are alive, we are aware that we exist. When we are dead, we are no longer aware of anything. So, death is the end of being aware of anything.\nYearning for the end of life is a contradiction. If you are alive, you want to be alive.

Hobbes does not think that people ought to desire something simply because it is conducive to their happiness. He thinks that what makes something good is that it is conducive to human happiness."}

Unlike rules, which are designed to guide a particular decision, moral principles are intended to guide any decision. A moral theory can specify the principles that an agent should follow in deciding what to do.\nSome moral theories say that the rightness of an action depends solely on its consequences. These theories are consequentialist.\nConsequentialist theories can be further divided into those that focus on the agent's intentions (virtue oriented) and those that focus on the overall outcome of the action (deontological and egoistic).\nA virtue oriented consequentialist theory says that an action is right if and only if it is an action that a virtuous person would do. Virtuous person is defined in terms of the qualities of character that promote overall happiness or flourishing.\nA deontological consequentialist theory says that an action is right if and only if it leads to the best overall outcome. This type of theory is also called an end-result theory.\nAn egoistic consequentialist theory says that an action is right if and only if it leads to the best overall outcome for the agent. This type of theory is also called a self-interest theory.\nA moral theory that says that the rightness of actions depends solely on their consequences is a consequentialist theory. These theories are not concerned with the agent's intentions. They are not concerned with whether the agent is acting out of virtue, or out of self-interest, or out of a desire to do the right thing. They are only concerned with the overall outcome."}

Different theories of what those rules are may lead to different answers about where and when one is obligated to do what the rules require.\nFor example, a theory that focuses on the results of an action may hold that one is obligated to do what the ideal moral rules would require in a setting devoid of institutions. In such a setting, one may be able to do an action that has the best possible results.\nA theory that focuses on adherence to rules may hold that one is obligated to do what the ideal moral rules would require in an ideal institutional setting.

A quote may support a claim by appearing directly after a statement that sets up the quote as an example or a special case of a more general rule. On the other hand, a quote may refute a claim by appearing directly before a statement that contradicts the quote.\nSOLUTION: The reading assigns Gauthier the view that deliberative justification is replaced once we acknowledge moral requirements. The quote appears directly after a statement that sets up the view as an example of a more general rule. So, the quote refutes the idea that deliberative justification is refuted by moral requirements."}

In this case, the argument is not necessarily false, but it is not necessarily true, either.

In a democracy, the majority makes rules and laws. But the laws cannot be unfair or unjust. If they are, people can go to court to get relief. For example, in the United States, people can go to court if the government or an individual has broken a law. Laws that are broken are called rights. If one person is harmed by another person, that person may have a right to be compensated for the harm. Compensation is like money that the other person has to give to the first person.\nJudges are supposed to interpret laws. Judges have to decide what laws mean. For example, a law may say that people can walk on the sidewalk. But what if the sidewalk is cracked and someone trips and falls? A judge has to decide what the law means in this case.\nIn a democracy, the king or queen is not in charge. In a democracy, the people are in charge. In a democracy, the people choose people to make laws for them. These people are called representatives.\nSOLUTION: According to Locke, every person in a society is bound by the laws of that society. So, every man, by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to everyone of that society to submit to the determination of the judges.

These aims are fundamental to any life, and they are not acquired. Children do not need to learn what their basic needs are.\nIn order to decide what is right or wrong, we need to know what our basic aims are. If we do not know what our aims are, then we do not know what is wrong with a plan or an action that thwarts or frustrates those aims.\nFor example, if we do not know what our aims are, then we do not know that one choice is better than another. Imagine that you are trying to decide whether to go to the gym or to stay home and watch television. If your aim is to relax, then you would think that staying home is the better choice. But if your aim is to be physically fit, then you would think that going to the gym is the better choice.\nSome things are intrinsically valuable, and these are the things that are most fundamentally beneficial or most fundamentally worthy of pursuit. In other words, these are the things that make life most worth living.\nFor example, living a life of virtue is intrinsically valuable. This makes sense, because living a life of virtue is most fundamentally beneficial. If living a life of virtue were not intrinsically valuable, then it would not be most fundamentally beneficial.\nSome things are instrumentally valuable, and these are the things that are beneficial or worthy of pursuit because they get you something that is intrinsically valuable. In other words, these things are not most fundamentally beneficial or most fundamentally worthy of pursuit in themselves.\nFor example, eating a meal is instrumentally valuable. This makes sense, because eating a meal is beneficial because it keeps you alive. But living a life of virtue is more fundamentally beneficial. So, eating a meal is not more intrinsically valuable than living a life of virtue.\nSOLUTION: Aristotle believes that we should begin ethical inquiry by specifying what our fundamental duties are. This is because the right thing to do is to do our duty.\nWhat are the fundamental duties of a human being? Aristotle thinks that we have an aim in living, which is to live a life of virtue. So, a human being's fundamental duties include the duties that are necessary for living a life of virtue."}

When an author criticizes another, they often charge that the other author has not lived up to his or her own standards. To understand the criticism, you need to keep track of the author's terms and definitions.\nIn her essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Elizabeth Anscombe criticizes G.E. Moore and W.D. Ross for not distinguishing between the foreseen and intended consequences of an action.\nAccording to Anscombe, Moore and Ross commit the failing that Ross identifies in the intuitional morality that they criticize. They do not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of an action.\nAnscombe claims that this failure makes these moral theorists vulnerable to the charge that they endorse the divine law conception of ethics.\nAccording to Anscombe, the divine law theorist believes that an action is right if and only if it is what God commands. But what makes an action a command of God? According to the divine law theorist, what God commands is what will bring about the greatest amount of overall satisfaction. To determine what God commands, you must decide what will bring about the greatest amount of overall satisfaction and then do that.\nAnscombe claims that Moore and Ross can be charged with endorsing the divine law conception of ethics because they do not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of an action.\nIf you do not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of an action, you may think that an action is right if it brings about the greatest overall satisfaction. This is the theory that Anscombe calls the greatest-satisfaction theory.\nAnscombe argues that the greatest-satisfaction theory is not the correct theory. According to Anscombe, the greatest-satisfaction theory implies that it is right to do an action that brings about the greatest overall satisfaction, even if that action also brings about other consequences that are not satisfactory.\nAnscombe claims that this theory does not give the right answer in cases where there are other consequences that are not satisfactory.\nSOLUTION: To understand Anscombe's criticism of Sidgwick, you need to consider the terms and definitions Sidgwick uses.\nSidgwick argues that the most we can hope for in this life is a \"negative\" good, such as the absence of pain. A \"positive\" good is a greater amount of satisfaction. Sidgwick believes that the universe contains a \"natural balance\" such that for every positive good that happens, there is a corresponding negative good.\nAccording to Anscombe, Sidgwick claims that there is a \"natural balance\" to the universe.\nThis means that for every positive good that happens, there is a corresponding negative good.\nAnscombe claims that Sidgwick does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of an action.\nAccording to Anscombe, a person foresees a consequence of an action if the person takes that consequence to be a possibility. A person intends a consequence of an action if the person takes that consequence to be a goal.\nAnscombe claims that Sidgwick does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of an action. For example, Sidgwick does not distinguish between a person's intentions and that person's foreseen consequences."}

For example, we might see that it is right to return a library book before leaving a town. We can then come to see that it is prima facie wrong to leave town with the library book. From this, we can apprehend the general principle that we should not leave town with something belonging to someone else.\nAnother philosopher, W.D.

For example, we might apprehend the general principle that we should not leave town with something belonging to someone else. We can then infer that it is prima facie wrong to leave town with a library book.\nA third philosopher, Immanuel Kant, believes that we cannot learn of our moral duties from our own inclinations and interests.

They signal the appearance of Nagel's own thoughts and concerns. According to Nagel, the problem of moral luck arises because: the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events. In other words, the problem of moral luck arises because the self is under threat when moral assessments are made in terms of the circumstances of an action rather than its outcome. In the first paragraph, Nagel claims that we cannot base moral assessments on the circumstances of an action because the actor cannot be identified. In the second paragraph, he presents the case of the statute and the person who jumps in front of a moving vehicle to save the statute. Nagel believes that the person is not morally responsible for his action, but that is not because the outcome was not serious. Rather, it is because the self is under threat when moral assessments are made in terms of the circumstances of an action rather than its outcome. In the third paragraph, Nagel discusses the implications of the problem of moral luck. He claims that our theories of human action are hopelessly off track. We cannot make sense of the notion that the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events. This is because we are unable to step back from our own point of view.\nSOLUTION: Nagel is not claiming that philosophers try to apply arbitrarily stringent standards to moral responsibility (A). Nor is he claiming that our moral theories are hopelessly off track (C). Nagel is claiming that our theories of human action are hopelessly off track (D). He believes that we cannot make sense of the problem of moral luck."}

They can be triggered by different things and can lead to different actions. They can also influence how you perceive things.\nSome emotions are mild and do not last long. Other emotions are strong and can change your behavior.\nWhen you are using ethical thinking, it is important to be aware of your feelings. They can be a important part of how you define a moral problem. But feelings are not the most important part of how you define a moral problem.\nEmotions can be triggered by different things. They can be based on your senses, your beliefs, or your values.\nSome emotions are based on your senses. You can see that something is hurt or damaged, and you feel bad.\nSome emotions are based on your beliefs. You may believe that certain things are wrong, and you feel bad when you do them.\nSome emotions are based on your values. You may feel that certain things are important, and you feel good when you do them.\nSOLUTION: Feelings are not an unerring guide. This means that you should not make decisions only based on how you feel. Your feelings can change, and they can be affected by your mood or by what you have been doing.\nFeelings are not essential to impartiality. You can be impartial by using ethical thinking and not letting your feelings affect your judgments.\nFeelings are essential and inevitable. Everyone has feelings. Everyone has a sense of what feels good or bad.\nFeelings are reason based. When you have a feeling, it is because something has happened. Either you have perceived something or you have done something. Your feelings can tell you that something has happened, but they do not tell you what to do."}

It must be logical, it must be empirically adequate, and it must be consistent with previous theories. A theory that is not empirically adequate is not valid. It may be a logical model, but it is not a theory.\nA theory is not just a description of an event. A description of an event may be empirically adequate, but it is not necessarily a theory. A theory is a particular type of description that is designed to refer to observable events.\nA theory is not just a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a tentative assumption about an unobserved phenomenon. A theory is a more complete hypothesis. It is a description of an unobserved phenomenon that is designed to be verified by observations.\nThe criteria of validity apply to all theories, not just to theories in the natural sciences. But the criteria of empirical adequacy do not apply to all theories.\nIn the social sciences, a theory may be empirically adequate even if it has not been verified by observation. This is because it may be difficult or impossible to observe some social phenomena.\nIn the field of economics, for example, it is impossible to observe all the phenomena that are described by economic theories. But economic theories are still empirically adequate. They are designed to be verified by observations, and they can be verified by observations that are possible to make.\nIn contrast, a theory in the natural sciences is not empirically adequate if it has not been verified by observation. A theory in the natural sciences makes a prediction that can be tested by observing the behavior of a specific object. If the behavior of the object does not match the prediction, the theory is not empirically adequate.\nSOLUTION: In order to show how particular objects of experience cause us to recall innate ideas, a theory must be empirically adequate. It must be possible to observe the effect of particular objects of experience on people's recall of innate ideas.\nSince it is impossible to observe how particular objects of experience cause us to recall innate ideas, this theory is not empirically adequate. It is not a valid theory."}

Mill claimed that the principle of utility can be derived from two other first principles: the indifference of pleasure and pain and the importance of consciousness.\nThese three first principles are self-evident, which means that they can be known without proof. Because the principle of utility can be known in this way, Mill claimed that it cannot be proven from self-evident principles.\nHowever, Mill also recognized that first principles cannot be proven by empirical methods. To prove something from empirical principles, you can observe the situation in which two things are equal and then conclude that they are always equal.
