Harm can be caused by pushing, shoving, hitting, or in any other way causing pain or discomfort to another person. Harm can also be caused by ignoring someone's needs.\nFor example, consider the following scenarios. In both cases, the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\nScenario 1: After school, the main character pushes a classmate in a crowded hallway.\nScenario 2: The main character walks by a classmate who has dropped his notebook. The main character picks up the notebook and walks away.\nMost people would find it wrong to push another person, even in a crowded hallway. On the other hand, turning your head and walking away after picking up a notebook is not necessarily wrong.\nSOLUTION: For the first scenario, the main character does something clearly morally wrong. The main character threw bread crumbs at ducks. Feeding bread to ducks is not bad. However, throwing bread at them can startle them and scare them away.\nFor the second scenario, the main character does not do something clearly morally wrong. The main character left the same diaper on his elderly paralyzed aunt for days at a time. Leaving a diaper on an adult is not bad. Adults can remove the diaper when they want."}

For example, persuading someone to lend you money by making them feel guilty is taking advantage of them.\nWhat is not wrong?\nEven if a action has some negative effects, it may not be wrong. What makes an action wrong is that it involves harming or taking advantage of another person.\nFor example, throwing a ball in the park is not wrong.

As a moral standard, the principle of respect for persons is generally considered to be central. This principle includes many different moral rules, such as the rules against lying, cheating, and deliberately causing pain or harm to others.\nOne of the key points in the principle of respect for persons is that individuals have a right to make certain that they do not suffer harm from the actions of others. In other words, persons have a right to be let alone. This right is important because it helps to protect individual autonomy and dignity.\nAn action that violates this right to be let alone is morally wrong. For example, the following actions are morally wrong:\nlying to someone,\ncausing someone unnecessary pain,\nand taking pictures of someone without that person's consent.\nOn the other hand, the following actions are not morally wrong:\ncutting someone's hair when the person is asleep,\nand running a red light when no one is around."}

Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite and will eventually be depleted, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Here are some key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources:\n1. Availability: Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible, while non-renewable energy sources are finite and will eventually run out.\n2. Environmental impact: Renewable energy sources have a much lower environmental impact than non-renewable sources, which can lead to air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other negative effects.\n3. Cost: Renewable energy sources can be more expensive to initially set up, but they typically have lower operational costs than non-renewable sources.\n4. Reliability: Renewable energy sources are often more reliable and can be used in more remote locations than non-renewable sources.\n5. Flexibility: Renewable energy sources are often more flexible and can be adapted to different situations and needs, while non-renewable sources are more rigid and inflexible.\n6. Sustainability: Renewable energy sources are more sustainable over the long term, while non-renewable sources are not, and their depletion can lead to economic and social instability."}

It involves a set of values and a sense of what is right and wrong in everyday life. Moral principles are more abstract and are considered by many people to be the foundation of ordinary morality. They are often based on shared beliefs and are used to justify general rules.\nBoth the principle of respect for persons and the principle of responsibility are moral principles.\nRespect for persons is the idea that individuals are important and have value. It includes the idea that people should be free to make choices about their own lives.\nThe principle of responsibility says that people should be accountable for their actions. It includes the idea that people should be able to make promises and be required to keep them.\nThese moral principles, and others like them, are supposed to help guide people in everyday situations. But they can be difficult to apply in specific situations. For example, what would respect for persons have to do with not sending astronauts into space without checking their suits for holes? What would the principle of responsibility have to do with asking a little girl to come over and cuddle?\nIn these cases, it is helpful to remember that ordinary morality is a matter of common sense. Everyday moral judgments are not always clear-cut, but they are made by people who share common sense moral values.\nSOLUTION: Scenario 1 is morally wrong. The main character does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Not checking astronauts' suits for holes could lead to death or serious injury. This is a mistake that should not be made.\nScenario 2 is not wrong. The main character does not do something clearly morally wrong. Asking a little girl to come over and cuddle is not seriously wrong."}

Spanking a child is also morally wrong because it causes suffering.\nSOLUTION: In scenario 1, the main character does something morally wrong. The main character deliberately delayed his or her roommate's laundry so that the roommate must go to a laundromat.

If you admit that you are not on your way, you are not lying.\nSOLUTION: In Scenario 1, the main character sprayed the phone with urine. This is a clear case of lying.
