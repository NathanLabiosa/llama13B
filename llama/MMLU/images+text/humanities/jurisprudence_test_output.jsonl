If you have an obligation to follow a rule, it means that you are expected to follow its rules.\nBeing obliged to follow a rule means that you are expected to follow the rule. If you break the rule, you will be subject to punishment.\nHaving an obligation to follow a rule means that you are expected to follow the rule. If you break the rule, you will be subject to punishment.\nA rule's power to compel comes from the sanction that is attached to it.\nSuppose that a library has a rule that you must be quiet. If you are told to be quiet, and you refuse, you will be subject to punishment. The punishment makes the rule's expectations binding.\nThe concept of a rule is central to Hart's theory of law.\nA rule is a set of expectations that specifies the behavior of actors in a system.\nHart's theory of law focuses on the relationship between rules and the principles that are used to decide cases.\nAccording to Hart, a rule has two aspects: the internal aspect and the external aspect. These two aspects are created by the way in which the rule is used.\nThe internal aspect of a rule is its substance. It is what the rule is about.\nThe external aspect of a rule is its connection to other rules.

The approach a court takes to making this choice depends on the philosophy of law it applies. Three such philosophies have been widely recognized in the United States: law and economics, critical legal studies, and natural law.\nLaw and economics assumes that markets are the most efficient way to organize economic activity. Legal decision making should seek to promote market efficiency, it argues. This philosophy's views about the role of law in society make it similar to the approach called economic analysis.\nCritical legal studies questions the way legal decisions are made and the assumptions behind them. Critical legal scholars believe that legal decisions are not based on objective principles, but are instead influenced by the interests of the powerful. They argue that the law should be used to challenge social inequalities.\nNatural law is based on the idea that there are rational, objective principles that should guide legal decision making. The most well-known version of natural law is the idea that there is a single, objective set of moral principles that should be used to guide society and the law. Other versions of natural law focus on the specific interests of different moral theorists.\nSOLUTION: The Law and Economics approach believes that promoting market efficiency should be the central goal of legal decision-making. So, the Law and Economics School would make this choice."}

Law as medium is the more formal and intermediate function of law. It is embodied in legal rules that are applicable to all members of society, and it contributes to the integration of society by removing ambiguities and providing guidance to individuals. Law as institution is the more informal and advanced function of law. It is embodied in the courts and other legal institutions that confront and interpret rules in specific cases and situations.

This means that law is not just a system of rules, but it is also a system of moral rules.\nThe 'harm principle' is a part of Fuller's inner morality of law. This principle says that there are limits on the rules of a legal system. Those limits are determined by the harm principle. The harm principle says that there are certain rules that a legal system may not make. For example, a legal system may not make rules that allow harm to other people.\nA positivist view of law is not a view of law that takes into account its moral content. A positivist views law as a system of rules that is based on social facts. Social facts are things that are made by people acting together. In this view, law is not based on moral principles. It is based on social facts.\nA morality of aspiration is a view of law that takes into account its moral content. According to this view, law is a system of rules that is based on moral principles.

Secondary rules do not necessarily have a clear and direct basis in the Constitution, but they are justified and can be sustained by reference to the Constitution.\nThe rule of recognition is a secondary rule. It is a rule that determines whether a particular matter is a subject of controversial political dispute. If a matter is not a subject of controversial political dispute, then the secondary rule of recognition will determine that it is not a legal issue.\nThe rule of recognition is not a social rule. A social rule is a rule that is made by a community. The rule of recognition is not made by the community, but rather is imposed by the courts.\nThe rule of recognition applies only in the case of unitary constitutions. In a unitary constitution, the central government has a monopoly on making rules. The rule of recognition is a rule that determines which rules are legal rules. In a federal constitution, the states and the central government have a joint stake in the constitution. So, the rules of recognition in a federal constitution are made by the central government.\nThe rule of recognition fails to specify the source of authority.

They identify what a particular norm does or explains how a particular norm affects the behavior of officials or members of a legal system.\nSome statements of purpose reflect basic presuppositions that are taken for granted in a legal system. These statements do not describe the consequences of following the norms; they describe the norms themselves. For example, the ultimate source of a legal system's morality is a statement of purpose that reflects the basic presupposition that there is a moral source to the legal system.\nOther statements of purpose define the scope of a legal system. These statements describe the norms that are within the legal system and the norms that are outside of it. For example, the constitution of a state is a statement of purpose that defines the scope of the legal system. It identifies the norms that are part of the legal system and the norms that are not part of the legal system.\nSOLUTION: The Grundnorm is the rule that distinguishes norms from habits of obedience. It is the criterion that a norm must meet to be a norm. To be a norm, a rule must be prescribed and proscribed. It must be a duty to follow the rule, and it must be a duty not to violate the rule.

The police power is the power of the government to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its people.\nRegulatory law also includes administrative law. Administrative law is the law that governs the activities of administrative agencies. An administrative agency is a government agency that is responsible for enforcing a particular regulatory scheme.\nQualified is a synonym for qualified.\nCollaborated is a synonym for collaborated.\nCodified is the correct answer.\nCodified law is a collection of statutes. A statute is a rule that is enacted by a legislative body. In the United States, statutes are enacted by Congress. In other countries, statutes are enacted by a variety of different bodies.\nSome statutes are simple. They may contain only a single sentence. Other statutes are more complex. They may contain multiple provisions.\nSOLUTION: Collaborated and codified are synonyms.\nStatutes are often called codified law."}

A tort is a wrongful act that harms someone else. In order to prove a tort, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were intentional, or negligent, and that the defendant's actions caused the plaintiff's harm.\nFor example, if a plaintiff trips and falls on a sidewalk, and the defendant had nothing to do with the sidewalk, the plaintiff's harm is not caused by the defendant's actions. In this case, the defendant is not liable.\nIn a criminal case, the state has the burden of proving that the defendant committed a crime. In order to prove a crime, the state must show that the defendant's actions were intentional.\nFor example, if a plaintiff trips and falls on a sidewalk, and the defendant had nothing to do with the sidewalk, the plaintiff's harm is not caused by the defendant's actions. In this case, the defendant is not liable.\nBattery is a tort. It is commited when a person touches another person without that person's consent.\nAssistant: SOLUTION: Sally was scared, but Donny did not actually touch her. So, Donny will not be liable for battery.\nAssault is a tort. It is committed when a person tries to hurt another person, but the person does not actually touch the other person.\nSally was scared, and Donny did not actually touch her.

Marxist theory argues that law is shaped by the underlying economic system and that capitalist law is used to benefit the capitalist class. In a capitalist economy, the capitalist class has the most power and wealth, and law is used to maintain this system. In a socialist society, the proletariat class has the most power and wealth, and law is used to maintain this system. In a socialist society, the Marxist theory of law would be taken more seriously, and individual rights would be rejected in favor of the greater good.\nSOLUTION: A Marxist account of law rejects individual rights because they are inconsistent with state control. According to Marxist theory, individual rights are in conflict with the collective good. In a socialist society, the greater good comes before individual rights."}

A theory can be pure without being unreal. For example, the pure part of a theory might involve the concepts involved in a problem, while the impure part of the theory might involve assumptions that are unproven or untestable.\nA theory that is not pure is an impure theory. An impure theory is a theory that deals with the practical problems involved in a situation. An impure theory can be useful because it is specific and testable.\nSOLUTION: Kelsen's pure theory of law is a theory that deals only with the concepts involved and ignores the practical problems.\nKelsen defined law in according with morality and purity.

It asks the question \"What is the law?\" and \"What should the law be?\"\nThe nature of law is a question that has been debated by scholars for centuries. Meanwhile, the practice of law has changed dramatically over the past few decades. Many new laws have been created to deal with issues that were not as much of a concern in the past.\nThere are four major approaches to jurisprudence, or theories of law. Each of these approaches is based on a different understanding of the nature of law:\nThe command approach views law as a set of rules that the ruling group or authority has established. According to this approach, law is not based on moral or ethical principles, but on the whims of the ruling authority.\nThe law and economics approach views law as a tool that can be used to promote economic growth and efficiency. This approach is based on the idea that costs and benefits are at the heart of most legal disputes.\nThe natural law approach views law as a reflection of underlying moral and ethical principles. According to this approach, the law should reflect what is right and just.\nThe critical legal studies approach views law as a tool of the powerful. This approach claims that law is not an objective set of rules, but is instead shaped by the social and political characteristics of the powerful.\nSOLUTION: The philosophers of the command school believe that the law is a set of rules developed, communicated, and enforced by the ruling party. They do not believe that the law is a reflection of the society's morality, history, logic, or sociology."}

He believed that punishment should be used to keep people from breaking the rules, not to punish people for revenge or to make them suffer.\nDeterrence is the main purpose of punishment, according to Durkheim. If punishment is harsh enough, it will deter people from breaking the rules.\nHowever, Durkheim did not think that punishment could change a person's character. So, rehabilitation is not Durkheim's view of the function of punishment.\nVengeance is not Durkheim's view of the function of punishment, either. A society can punish people for revenge, but that does not maintain the society.\nDesert is the idea that people get only the punishments they deserve. But what deserves what? A society uses rules to decide what is punishable. So, desert is not a clear answer to the question of the function of punishment."}

He uses the analogy of a ship to illustrate his view. A ship is a single entity, and so is the law. So, he argues that judges must look to the law as a single coherent structure and seek to determine what it requires in a particular case.\nDworkin believes that understanding the law involves understanding its rules. He defines a rule as a set of principles that are mutually supportive. For Dworkin, a rule is not a simple set of instructions or a list of prohibited actions. Instead, a rule is a set of principles that come together to provide a standard for decision making.\nDworkin also believes that the rule of recognition is not a rule. A rule of recognition is a rule that is accepted as a basic part of the legal system. For Dworkin, the rule of recognition is not a rule because it is not a set of principles that are mutually supportive."}

A legal fiction can be used to simplify a problem, to put a person or entity in a better position, or to make the law more consistent.\nFor example, for many years, the law assumed that children could not be employed. But this fiction was changed by the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which set the minimum working age at 16.\nAnother example of a legal fiction is the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. This person is not really a secretary of the Treasury, but the law assumes that he or she is. This allows the Assistant Secretary to sign documents or perform other acts that would normally be done by the Secretary of the Treasury.\nSOLUTION: A legal fiction is an assumption that the law makes, even though it is not real. It can be used to modify a rule of law without changing its language.\nThe definition of legal fiction describes a rule of law that has been altered, its letter being unchanged, its operation being modified."}

It views law as a social practice, with its own internal structure.\nThe Scandinavian realists are a group of legal scholars who share many of the insights of American legal realism. But they also have some important differences. They reject the idea that law is based on natural law or morality. Instead, they see law as a product of social practices.\nJeremy Bentham and Austin both argue that law arises from the habitual actions of legal officials. But Bentham is skeptical of the common law. He thinks that the common law is not a genuine system of law, but rather a set of customs that have been allowed to drift over time.\nJohn Austin's view of the common law is more charitable. He thinks that the common law is a system of law, but one that is imperfectly understood. Austin believes that the common law is a system of rules that are based on the commands of the sovereign.\nSOLUTION: The Scandinavian realists reject a metaphysical approach to law because they see it as an unreliable method by which to understand the concept of law. They prefer an empirical approach.\nThe Scandinavian realists have no interest in the operation of the legal system. They see law as a social practice, and their focus is on the ways in which legal officials create rules and principles.\nBentham's sceptical account of the common law does not necessarily contradict his view that legal rules are created by legal officials. Bentham believed that rules are created by officials, but he was sceptical of the common law's claim to be a system of law.\nA natural law analysis of legal ideas is not central to the Scandinavian realist approach. Unlike natural law theorists, who seek to discover a higher law that should be applied in every case, the Scandinavian realists see law as a product of social practices."}

It asks questions about the nature of law, its role in society, and the principles on which it should be based.\nThere are four major perspectives, or schools, of jurisprudence. They are not exhaustive, but they are the most important.\nThe command perspective believes that law is a system of rules that have been given by a higher authority. This higher authority can be a deity, or it can be a government that is acting in the public's best interest.\nThe sociological perspective believes that law is a product of society. It reflects the values and needs of a community. Law is not the command of a higher authority, but rather an expression of the customs and norms of a people.\nThe analytical perspective believes that law is a tool of the state. It is used by the state to accomplish its goals. Laws are not rules that have been given by a higher authority, but rather tools that the state uses to achieve its objectives.\nThe historical perspective believes that law is an aggregate of social traditions and customs that have developed over the centuries.

One way realists describe the relationship between law and society is that law is determined by social facts. This means that law is not fixed or certain, but depends on the particular social context in which it arises. For example, the laws of one society may differ from the laws of another society.\nThe social facts that affect the content of law include politics, the economy, and culture. For example, the laws of a society may reflect the political and economic interests of powerful groups. They may also reflect the cultural values of the society.\nOther schools of legal thought do not see law as simply a product of social facts.\nThe ontological school believes that law is a system of rules that has a life of its own. Laws are valid and binding, whether or not anyone follows them.\nThe epistemological school believes that law is a system of rules that is created by a process of social negotiation. Laws are valid and binding, but the rules are effective only if people believe that they are valid."}
{"question": "The will theory of rights maintains that the enforcement of Y's duty requires the exercise of will by X. It assumes the correlativity of rights and duties.

An interest is a value, and a value is something that a person wants. An interest can take many forms, and each form is represented by a right. For example, the right to free speech is an interest in being able to express yourself without censorship.\nThe will theory of rights maintains that the enforcement of your rights requires the exercise of will by other people. It assumes that rights and duties are correlative. This means that if you have a right, then someone else has a duty. For example, if you have a right to free speech, then other people have a duty not to censor you.\nThe interest theory of rights does not make this assumption. According to the interest theory, your interests can be protected without the need to impose duties on other people. For example, your interest in not being censored can be protected by laws that prohibit censorship, not by a duty of another person not to censor you.\nSOLUTION: The first attempt at formulating the interest theory does not make the assumption that rights and duties are correlative. It proposes that X's interest is related to Y's duty. However, this proposal does not address the role of will. It simply states that X's interest is related to Y's duty.\nThe second attempt at formulating the interest theory does not make the assumption that rights and duties are correlative. It accepts that conferring a right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized. This proposal does not mention will.\nThe third attempt at formulating the interest theory makes the assumption that rights and duties are correlative. It treats an interest as the exercise of choice. This proposal includes an element of will.\nThe fourth attempt at formulating the interest theory asserts that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties\u2014only when they are actually imposed. This proposal makes the assumption that rights and duties are correlative. It includes an element of will."}

In their works, they offer different views about the role of government and the social contract.\nAccording to Hobbes, life before the social contract was a state of nature. In the state of nature, there was no government, no laws, and no contract. Life was \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" Hobbes believed that people in the state of nature were willing to give up some of their freedom in order to have a government that would establish laws and order.\nAccording to Locke, life before the social contract was not as Hobbes described it. Locke believed that in the state of nature, people were not as motivated by self-interest as Hobbes claimed. He also believed that in the state of nature, people could choose to establish a social contract. By forming a social contract, people could give up some of their freedom in order to establish a government that would protect their natural rights.\nBoth Hobbes and Locke agree that the principal purpose of government is to maintain order. They also agree that the social contract is an agreement that people enter into voluntarily. However, they have opposing views about the nature of contractual obligations. Hobbes believed that people's obligations were absolute, whereas Locke believed that people could dissolve their obligations if the government failed to protect their natural rights.\nHobbes and Locke also have opposing views about the role of law in society. Hobbes believed that laws should be created by the government, and that the primary function of laws is to maintain order. Locke believed that laws should be created by the people, and that the primary function of laws is to protect the natural rights of the people.\nHobbes and Locke do not disagree about the role of the courts in maintaining order. Both philosophers believe that the primary function of the courts is to enforce the laws."}

Jurists can be judges, who apply laws to make decisions in particular cases, or legislators, who make laws.\nLon Fuller was a jurist who focused on the differences between the branch of the law that deals with the rights and obligations of individuals, called civil law, and the branch that deals with crimes and punishment, called criminal law.\nIn his hypothetical case of the Speluncean Explorers, Fuller asks the reader to consider a situation in which five explorers are stranded in a cave. They have no food, and so they decide to eat one of their own. They are subsequently rescued, and the surviving explorers are put on trial for murder.\nThe facts of the case are used to illustrate the differences between the civil law and the criminal law. The civil law deals with actions that harmed other individuals. In the civil law, the harm is usually a trespass for which money damages can be obtained. In the criminal law, the harm is a crime, and the perpetrator is subject to punishment.\nThe central questions of legal and political philosophy are the questions that arise from the relationship between law and society. These questions concern the nature of law, the relationship between law and morality, and the role of jurists in society.\nFuller's case of the Speluncean Explorers is a critique of the role of the judiciary in cases involving a conflict between law and morality. It illustrates the problem of determining the extent to which a judge should consider the moral implications of a case.\nMens rea is a Latin phrase that means \"guilty mind.\" It is a requirement for most crimes. To convict a defendant of a crime, a jurist usually must prove that the defendant had a guilty mind."}

So, lexical priority means that language has higher priority over law.\nAn unjust law is not law.\nAn unjust law is a law that is unfair or wrong. At one time, many laws were based on the belief that some people are inherently superior to others. These laws were unjust.\nLex iniusta non est lex is a statement that an unjust law is not law. This statement means that an unjust law is not a law at all.\nThe law is not valid unless it is formally enacted.\nA law that is not formally enacted is not a real law.

According to Regan, animals are not just things, but they are beings that have rights.\nRegan believes that the following principle applies to animals: \"An animal is not just anything. An animal is a being that is capable of feeling and of experiencing the world around it. So, an animal has inherent value. If an animal has inherent value, then that animal has inherent rights.\"\nBecause animals have inherent rights, Regan believes that animals should not be used for human purposes, such as food, clothing, or research. He also believes that animals should not be kept in zoos or circuses.\nSOLUTION: Tom Regan's sentimental anthropomorphicism in support of animals' rights means that he believes animals have inherent worth, which entitles them to the absolute right to live their lives with respect and autonomy.\nAccording to Regan, the suffering of a few animals may in principle be justified by the pleasure of or benefit to the many.

What is fair depends on what society considers just. What society considers just depends on its collective conception of justice.\nThere are many theories of justice. One of them is the capability approach.\nThe capability approach begins with the idea that the most basic resources for being just are capabilities. Just institutions and just policies expand the capabilities of some group.\nWhat makes one policy more just than another depends on how it affects people's capabilities. A just policy is one that expands the basic capabilities of the poorest members of society.\nThe capability approach rejects Rawls' theory of justice.\nRawls believes that the most basic rights are the rights to life, liberty, and property. He considers a society just if it respects these rights.\nBut the capability approach argues that the right to life, liberty, and property does not capture what is important about the distribution of resources. What is important is the set of capabilities that people have.\nFor example, the right to life, liberty, and property does not capture whether a person has the capability to speak freely. The capability approach considers freedom of speech to be a capability.\nThe approach also considers the capability to participate in political decision-making to be a capability. So, a just society, according to the capability approach, is one that expands the capabilities of some group.\nSOLUTION: The capability approach rejects Rawls' theory of justice because it fails to address the actual capabilities people have to benefit from his theory of justice.\nRawls' theory of justice applies to peacetime society.
