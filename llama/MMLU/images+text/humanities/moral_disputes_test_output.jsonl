For example, people today have gained much more control over the growth of their economies and the quality of their societies. To understand how this change has come about, it is helpful to know about the ideas of John Stuart Mill.\nMill believed that the main goal of government should be to create the conditions for human happiness. He believed that a government for the people should do two things: create wealth and distribute it fairly.\nMill thought that the value of a particular pleasure depended on both its quantity and its quality. For example, he thought that a small quantity of a pleasure that is highly enjoyable is more valuable than a large quantity of a less enjoyable pleasure.\nIn order to improve the lives of his fellow Brits, Mill argued that governments should do three things. They should create more opportunities for education. They should create more opportunities for employment. And they should make sure that the wealth that is created is distributed fairly.\nSOLUTION: Look at the way Mill described the value of a particular pleasure.\nThe value of a particular pleasure depends on both its quantity and its quality.\nBecause the value of a pleasure depends on both its quantity and quality, both its quantity and its quality are what its value depends on."}

Moral theories can be described as either teleological or deontological.\nA teleological moral theory is based on the notion of a right, which is an action that has a right effect. An action has a right effect if it promotes a certain purpose. The most famous teleological moral theory is consequentialism, which holds that an action is right if it promotes the most overall happiness or the greatest good.\nA deontological moral theory is based on the notion of a duty, which is an action that is required by a rule. An action is required by a rule if it follows from the rule. The most famous deontological moral theory is Kantianism, which holds that an action is right if it follows from the rule of duty.\nA virtue ethic is based on the notion of a virtue, which is a habit or disposition that it is morally good to have. Virtue ethics holds that an action is right if it is done for the right reason, and the right reason is a virtue.\nContractualism is a type of deontological moral theory. It holds that an action is right if it follows from the principles that people would choose to follow if they were deciding on these principles in a fair and informed way."}

If we treat the environment as a matter of trade-offs, we must give up the idea that we can optimize all of these aims and values at the same time. Instead, we need to identify a set of aims and values that can guide our trade-offs and help us live sustainably. Baxter argues that we should view our treatment of the environment as a matter of various trade-offs whose aim is to promote human welfare.\nSOLUTION: Baxter argues that we should view our treatment of the environment as a matter of various trade-offs whose aim is to promote human welfare. This approach assumes that the natural environment is a source of benefits to human beings.\nIf we accept this assumption, we can see that the other answers are not as closely focused on promoting human welfare as Baxter's approach. Minimizing damage to individual living beings could be important, but it is not as directly focused on promoting human welfare as is Baxter's approach. Suffering of sentient creatures and ecosystem integrity are not directly focused on promoting human welfare."}

These theories offer different justifications for punishing people who break the law.\nRetributive theories of punishment focus on the notion of moral desert. Imagine that you are a judge. You believe that the main purpose of punishment is to correct bad behavior. But you also believe that some actions are so bad that they deserve punishment, even if punishing the person does not correct the behavior. For example, retributive theories of punishment might justify punishing a person for committing a terrible crime, even if the person is unlikely to commit another crime in the future.\nPerfectionist theories of punishment focus on the notion of deterrence. Imagine that you are a judge. You believe that the main purpose of punishment is to prevent people from breaking the law. To do this, the punishment must be sufficient to deter the person from committing another crime. For example, perfectionist theories of punishment might justify giving a person a longer sentence for committing a crime with a deadly weapon, as the weapon makes it more likely that the person will commit another crime.\nLegal theories of punishment focus on the notion of rehabilitation. Imagine that you are a judge. You believe that the main purpose of punishment is to help people who break the law to change their ways. For example, legal theories of punishment might justify sending a person to a drug rehabilitation program instead of sending the person to prison.\nPreventive theories of punishment focus on the notion of general deterrence. Imagine that you are a judge. You believe that the main purpose of punishment is to prevent other people from breaking the law. For example, preventive theories of punishment might justify giving a person a longer sentence to set an example for others.\nSOLUTION: Retributive theories of punishment are at odds with consequentialist approaches to punishment. According to retributive theories of punishment, the main purpose of punishment is to correct bad behavior or to hold people accountable for their actions. Retributive theories do not focus on the benefits that punishing people can bring."}

In other words, the argument supports the conclusion.\nThe conclusion of an argument does not necessarily have to be drawn directly from the argument. The conclusion can also be drawn by following up on the argument. For example, if an argument supports a claim, the claim is the conclusion. If a claim is supported by an argument, the claim is the conclusion.\nA conclusion can be supported by a single argument or by multiple arguments.\nSOLUTION: The question tells you that Reiman believes that van den Haag's argument leads to the conclusion that the refusal to execute criminals has a civilizing effect. van den Haag's argument leads to this conclusion because it claims that the refusal to execute criminals has the potential to make society more dangerous. This conclusion is based on the idea that the refusal to execute criminals leads to an increase in the number of criminals. If the number of criminals increases, society becomes more dangerous."}

So, what makes things equal?\nAccording to Singer, the principle of equality requires that if one person is to have an equal chance to get a thing, then there must be at least some identical aspects of the person and the thing. If there are no such aspects, then the principle of equality requires differential treatment. For example, if everyone wants a different type of pizza, then the delivery person must make differential deliveries.\nIf the identical aspects of the person and the thing are not present, but the person believes that they are, then the principle of equality allows for the person to be disappointed. For example, if someone believes that two items are identical, but they are not, the principle of equality does not require that the items be exchanged."}

It does not harm someone just by being true of them. It only harms them when it is part of a larger social process that treats them as mere objects.\nSOLUTION: Nussbaum says that treating someone as an object is necessary for sexual objectification.

The action that leads to the best consequences is the right one.\nConsequentialist moral theories are value-based theories. They say that some actions are better than others.\nAn imperative of a consequentialist moral theory is an expression of what the agent ought to do. Imperatives identify the consequences that the agent ought to promote.\nAn alternative to an imperative is a course of action that the agent could take. An action is open to the agent if the agent could do it.\nA strongly impartialist moral theory is a moral theory that believes that some actions are right or wrong in themselves, independently of their consequences. Such a theory would not be consequentialist."}

Assistant Professor of Medical Ethics William J. Winslade writes that euthanasia is a term that is often used in a broader sense to include any intervention that ends the life of a person whose life may be terminated.\nSuicide is the act of killing oneself. It is typically seen as a response to depression, anxiety, or other emotional distress.\nMost societies today view suicide as a tragedy. In the past, however, suicide was often viewed as a cowardly or selfish act. Today, many people consider suicide from the perspective of the individual who takes his or her own life.

Each of the natural resources listed here is a fuel. Fuel is a natural resource that can be burned to release energy.\nAn oil spill is a visible reminder of how fuel can harm the environment. Oil spills kill birds and other animals, and can damage the water supply.\nSOLUTION: Step 1: Decide what Baxter's view is.\nIn his view, the first and foremost step toward a solution of our environmental problems is a clear recognition that our objective is not pure air or water but rather some optimal state of pollution.\nSome optimal state of pollution is an acceptable level of pollution.\nAn overall maximally clean environment is a state with no pollution. Baxter does not consider this option to be a step toward solving environmental problems.\nSome maximal state of pollution is the worst possible level of pollution. Baxter does not consider this option to be a step toward solving environmental problems.\nThe preservation of all living species is not a step toward a solution of our environmental problems. It is the solution to our environmental problems.\nStep 2: Find the choice that is Baxter's view.\nThe preservation of all living species is the view that the complete destruction of the environment will result in the extinction of all living species, including humans.\nSome optimal state of pollution is Baxter's view. An acceptable level of pollution is better than a worse level of pollution, but a complete lack of pollution is better yet."}

It can be a version of consequentialism, the ethics of prime facie duty, Kantian theory, or virtue ethics.\nConsequentialism is a moral theory that says an act is right if and only if it has good consequences. There are many different varieties of consequentialism.\nThe ethics of prime facie duty is a moral theory that says some acts are right or wrong in themselves. Right and wrong are not dependent on the consequences of an act.\nKantian theory is a moral theory that says an act is right if it is done for the right reason. A person has a duty to act in the right way, regardless of the consequences.\nVirtue ethics is a moral theory that says an act is right if and only if it is an act of a virtuous person. Virtue ethics is concerned with the character of a person, rather than with the specific acts that person performs.\nSOLUTION: To be a version of consequentialism, a moral theory must say that right and wrong depend on the consequences of an act. Virtue ethics does not make consequentialism's claim. So, virtue ethics is not a version of consequentialism.\nThe ethics of prime facie duty does not make consequentialism's claim. So, the ethics of prime facie duty is not a version of consequentialism.\nKantian theory says that right and wrong are not dependent on the consequences of an act.

However, retaliation is not a moral principle; instead, it is a consequence of the punitive mentality that focuses on revenge. The right to retaliate is incompatible with the right to punish, which is the foundation of the criminal law. Punishment aims to protect society and to restore the wrongdoer.\nThe principle of legality says that the law must be followed. All aspects of the criminal justice system must operate within the legal framework. The principle of legality means that the law enforcement officers, the prosecutors, and the judges must do their jobs according to the established legal procedures.\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the severity of the punishment match the severity of the crime. A more severe crime will be punished with a more severe penalty than a less severe crime.\nThe principle of precedent requires that similar cases be judged in similar ways. In other words, the punishment for a similar crime should be similar to the punishment for a similar crime that was previously judged.\nThe principle of intent says that the punishment should match the defendant's intent. The punishment should be severe if the defendant intended to cause serious harm. The punishment should be less severe if the defendant did not intend to cause serious harm.\nThe principle of voluntariness says that the punishment should match the voluntariness of the crime. The punishment should be less severe if the crime was committed involuntarily.\nThe principle of justification says that the punishment should match the justification for the crime. The punishment should be less severe if the crime was justified.\nSOLUTION: The answer is A.

After all, many things are born into people that are not good or natural. For example, people are born with a desire to eat chocolate, but that does not mean that it is always good for them.\nSimilarly, just because something is innate or natural does not mean that it is good or moral. For example, people are born with a desire to harm others, but that does not mean that harming others is good or moral."}

Different approaches to ethics can be used to answer questions about what is right and what is wrong.\nConsequentialist approaches judge the rightness or wrongness of an action by its consequences. According to consequentialism, an action is right if and only if it has good consequences.\nA virtue ethics approach focuses on the character of the person performing the action. An action is right if and only if it is performed by someone with good character.\nAn ethics of prime facie duty approach suggests that an action is right if and only if it fulfills a basic duty.\nA Christian/Marxist approach focuses on the effects of an action on people's lives. An action is right if and only if it promotes human flourishing.\nSOLUTION: Hardin argues that it is in our moral interest to have as few children as possible. He claims that having more children makes the problem of hunger and poverty worse, and that having fewer children makes it better. So, Hardin's approach is consequentialist in that it focuses on the consequences of having more or fewer children."}

Metaethics is the branch of ethics that addresses the nature of ethical properties, statements, and judgments.\nNatural law theory is a metaethical theory. It holds that there are universal truths about what is right and wrong that are based on human nature. These truths are discovered by observing the nature of the world and the human experience.\nVirtue ethics is a metaethical theory. It holds that the right thing to do is to do what is best for human beings. What is best for human beings is to cultivate virtues. Virtues are habits that make people able to act in their own best interests.\nDeontological ethics is a metaethical theory. It holds that the right thing to do is determined by rules. These rules are not based on the consequences of following them. Instead, the rules themselves are what make the act right or wrong.\nConsequentialist ethics is a metaethical theory. It holds that the right thing to do is to do what will have the best consequences. This theory does not focus on the rules or the virtues associated with an act. Instead, it looks at the overall outcome of the act.\nSOLUTION: A virtue ethics theory will approach the morality of abortion by considering how much overall intrinsic value is likely to be brought about by abortion. Abortion is not necessarily intrinsically good or bad, but it can be a necessary evil in certain situations.\nA consequentialist theory will approach the morality of abortion by considering how much overall intrinsic value is likely to be brought about by abortion. The right thing to do is to do what will have the best consequences. So, a consequentialist theory will look at the overall outcome of the abortion.\nA Kantian ethics theory will not approach the morality of abortion by considering how much overall intrinsic value is likely to be brought about by abortion. Immanuel Kant believed that the right thing to do is to act in accordance with the principles of the Categorical Imperative. The Categorical Imperative is a set of rules that tell you how to act. These rules are not based on the consequences of following them. Instead, the rules themselves are what make the act right or wrong.\nA natural law theory will not approach the morality of abortion by considering how much overall intrinsic value is likely to be brought about by abortion. Natural law theory is based on the idea that there are universal truths about what is right and wrong. These truths are based on human nature. The right thing to do is to do what is best for human beings. But the right thing to do is not necessarily to consider the consequences of an act."}

A human fetus is not viable until around 24 weeks into pregnancy, at which point it could potentially survive outside of the womb.\nMoral permissibility is the extent to which an action is morally right or wrong.

It is the view that right action is that which brings about the greatest amount of pleasure or the least amount of pain."}

Although some people believe that addiction is a choice, it is actually a disease that is caused by multiple social, genetic, and environmental factors.\nNearly every individual has a genetic profile that is predisposed to addiction. For example, some people have a genetic propensity for obesity, which is caused by the presence of specific genes. Similarly, some people have a genetic predisposition to addiction, which is caused by the presence of specific genes. Because of the genetic nature of this disease, it is not uncommon for individuals to have a family history of addiction.\nAddiction affects neurotransmitters in the brain, including dopamine. When an addictive substance is used, it causes a surge in dopamine levels in the brain. Over time, the brain adapts to the increased dopamine levels by producing fewer dopamine receptors. When the addictive substance is removed, the dopamine levels in the brain drop, and the brain responds by producing fewer dopamine receptors. This change in neurotransmitters and receptors makes it more difficult for the addict to experience pleasure.\nAddiction is a behavior that is reinforced by social factors. For example, an individual may be more likely to become addicted to a substance if he or she uses the substance with others. Similarly, an individual may be more likely to become addicted to a substance if he or she lives in an environment that makes it easy to obtain the substance.\nSOLUTION: Shapiro explains that the best explanation for drug addiction appeals to a person's individual mindset and social setting.

For example, it is permissible to use a drug that controls your pain but also causes addiction, if you need the drug to control your pain. The drug is a means to the bad effect of addiction, not a way of achieving a different goal. However, if you use the drug to get high, it is not a means to the bad effect of addiction; it is a way of achieving a different goal.\nIntrinsic value is a central concept in ethics. Something has intrinsic value when it is valuable in itself, not just because it is useful. So, pleasure has intrinsic value, because it is valuable in itself. But money does not have intrinsic value, because it is not valuable in itself. It is valuable because it can be exchanged for things that are valuable in themselves.\nSOLUTION: An action is intrinsically permissible if the action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible. So, the action is morally permissible, because it is not always wrong to do something that has both good and bad effects.\nNo actual person would ever endorse an action that is intrinsically wrong. So, the second choice is not correct.\nAn action is intrinsically valuable if it is valuable in itself. So, the action is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable. But that does not necessarily mean that the action is morally permissible.\nThe first choice is correct. The action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible."}

Sen- tience is the ability to have subjective experiences. Animals are sentient, but plants and fungi are not.\nDoes sentience determine moral status?\nSinger believes that it does. He claims that if an entity is sentient, then it has moral status. This means that it is morally important to avoid causing the entity unnecessary harm.\nDoes belonging to a moral community determine moral status?\nSinger argues that belonging to a moral community is not the single relevant factor in determining moral status.

Evidence can include data, statistics, stories, or examples.\nWhen you are evaluating a claim, it is often helpful to consider the evidence that supports the claim. Here are some ways to do that:\nCheck if the evidence is relevant. A relevant evidence is one that changes with the claim. For example, the fact that a car is useful is not relevant to the claim that a car is fast.\nConsider how the evidence supports the claim. Evidence can support a claim in different ways. For example, a statistic can illustrate a point, or an example can demonstrate a general rule.\nDetermine whether the evidence is strong. Strong evidence convinces you that the claim is true. Evidence can be strong even if it does not convince you completely. The strength of evidence can affect how strongly you believe the claim is true.\nSOLUTION: De Marneffe argues that increased availability of a drug leads to increased use of that drug.

If national borders are not open to immigration, it is often because the state is unable to provide for the basic needs of its citizens. But if a state cannot provide for the basic needs of its citizens, how can it fulfill its role as a liberal democracy? The question of whether a state should be able to close its borders to immigrants is thus closely tied to the question of whether liberal democracy can survive in a world in which the state is no longer the primary provider.\nSOLUTION: From a liberal egalitarian perspective, the sudden opening of one country's borders to immigrants might do more harm than good. But this possibility is not due to a violation of the principles of liberal egalitarianism. Rather, it is due to certain conditions that are not necessary violations of those principles. For example, the sudden influx of immigrants could put significant pressure on a country's resources, and this could lead to greater inequality. But this outcome is not necessarily due to a violation of the principles of liberal egalitarianism. So, liberal egalitarianism is not false.\nSOLUTION: Carens argues that sometimes you have to do more harm than good in the short term to do more good in the long term. This means that, in some cases, the opening of a country's borders to immigrants might do more harm than good. But this outcome is not due to a violation of the principles of liberal egalitarianism.

His principle, known as the Categorical Imperative, is often interpreted as never treating persons as mere means to your ends.\nIn other words, don't use people for their usefulness to you, or as a means to your own self-interest. Instead, treat them as ends in themselves, or as equally valuable to you.\nSOLUTION: The first answer choice is never as a mere means. This is the most direct way to ensure that you don't treat people as tools to use for your own benefit.\nThe second answer choice is never as a means. This choice is too weak, since it still allows you to use people as means to your ends.\nThe third answer choice is in ways that produce the most good for everyone concerned. This choice is not necessarily about doing the most good for others. It is about acting in ways that produce the most good, period. So, it is consistent with the Kantian principle.\nThe fourth answer choice is in ways that serve one's own best interests. This choice is too strong. According to Kant, it is never okay to use people as mere means to your ends. Using people to serve your own interests is exactly that."}

They might say that an action is wrong because it is contrary to some moral rule or principle. Some rules are universal, meaning that they apply to all people. Other rules are particular, meaning that they apply to specific groups or situations.\nMost moral principles are aimed at promoting well-being and reducing harm. So, a right action is one that brings about a benefit-harm balance that is at least as good as the best available alternative.\nA benefit-harm balance is a matter of how much good and harm something does. So, the right amount of harm is the amount of harm that makes the benefit-harm balance at least as good as the best available alternative.\nThe amount of harm that makes the benefit-harm balance at least as good as the best available alternative is what makes the punishment proportionate.\nSome philosophers think that the only punishments that are justified are punishments that are proportionate. They argue that the only actions that are wrong are those that involve harm that is not proportionate to the harm caused by the wrongdoing."}

An owner has the right to decide how to use his or her property.\nIn a society, people can have different ideas about what property rights are acceptable. How can these ideas affect other ideas? Can these ideas be consistent with one another?\nInconsistency comes when two ideas cannot be combined so that they both remain consistent. For example, the idea that a person can do anything he wants with his property and the idea that society has the right to limit the use of property are inconsistent.\nWhen ideas are inconsistent, they present problems. If you combine inconsistent ideas, you get contradictions.\nA contradiction is an idea that does not make sense. Inconsistent ideas are not consistent with one another.\nFor example, the idea that a person can do anything he wants with his property and the idea that society has the right to limit the use of property are inconsistent. You cannot consistently hold both ideas at the same time.\nSome inconsistencies can be resolved by changing one or more ideas. For example, you might decide that society does have the right to limit the use of property. But other inconsistencies are persistent.\nA society that allows individuals to own property can have different ideas about what property rights are acceptable. But these ideas cannot be completely inconsistent. For example, a society cannot have the idea that property owners have the right to limit the use of their property and the idea that society has the right to limit the use of property.\nSOLUTION: Wellman argues that insisting on unlimited property rights commits one to deontological theory. Deontological theory is the idea that there are absolute rules of morality.\nIn the political arena, some absolutes are used to justify totalitarian societies. For example, the idea that the end justifies the means is an absolute that has been used to justify totalitarian societies. Totalitarian societies are not anarchies, but they are not democracies either.\nIn an anarchy, there are no absolutes. An anarchy is a society without a government."}

When the government fails to recognize these rights, it commits an injustice.\nInjustices can happen when the government acts to harm individuals. For example, the government punishing a person for expressing an unpopular opinion is an injustice. The government acting to harm one of its citizens is also an injustice.\nOther injustices can happen when the government fails to act. For example, not protecting individuals from harm can be an injustice. Not providing a fair trial can be an injustice.\nThe answers below indicate how Huemer argues the government can disregard natural rights.\nIt is sometimes alright for the government to disregard natural rights to as to protect someone from themselves.\nHarming another person is a violation of that person's rights. So, to harm someone to protect them from themselves is contradictory.\nFailures by the government to recognize natural rights count as injustices.\nThe violation of a natural right is an injustice. So, when the government fails to recognize a natural right, it commits an injustice.\nIt is sometimes alright for the government to disregard natural rights, when the harms are bad enough.\nHarming a person is always a violation of that person's rights. So, the harms need to be especially bad for the government to disregard natural rights.\nIt is just bad for the government to fail to recognize natural rights.\nThe violation of a natural right is an injustice. So, the government failing to recognize natural rights counts as an injustice."}

Here are some ways in which governments can differ from each other:\n* Type of government: A government can be authoritarian, in which case only a few people rule. Or a government can be democratic, in which case more people can have a say.\n* Centralization: A government can be centralized, in which case power is held by a center. Or a government can be decentralized, in which case power is held by people outside the center.\n* Regime: A regime can be a dictatorship, in which case one person rules. Or a regime can be a monarchy, in which case power is passed down through a family. Or a regime can be a republic, in which case power is held by elected officials.\nSOLUTION: Pollution is one type of externality. Externalities are costs or benefits that are not reflected in the prices of goods and services.\nWhen the economic activity of wealthy nations imposes external costs on poor nations, the poor nations are being imposed upon. So, the externality imposes an unequal social order."}

We can use the term principle to refer to any one of the fundamental assumptions about right and wrong that makes up a system of ethics.\nSome ethical systems provide different principles. The principles of a system of ethics may give different answers to questions such as the following:\nWhat makes an action right?\nWhat makes an action wrong?\nWhat is the ultimate standard of right and wrong?\nWhat is the ultimate source of rights?\nSOLUTION: Sandel's case against moral engineering can be seen as an application of the ethics of prima facie duty. According to this approach, the principles that make an action right are that the action is necessary and that it is not wrong."}

While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:\nIdeas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?\nOrganization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?\nVoice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?\nSentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?\nWord choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?\nGrammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?\nSOLUTION: Look for the answer that is most similar to the problem. The problem involves the ticking time bomb scenario, and the answer should address the problem directly.\nBaron argues that a single instance of torture is a slippery slope that could lead to more torture. He contends that once a society accepts torture as a means of solving a problem, it becomes difficult to limit the use of torture to a single case. Thus, even if a single instance of torture were to save a million lives, it would still be wrong."}

We have an intuition that some action is wrong, and we have a second intuition that supports that first one. These two intuitions together justify our judgment that the action is wrong. When we make a moral judgment, we are assuming that our intuitions come in pairs.\nPart of a moral principle is an intuition that supports a particular judgment. A moral principle says that it is always wrong to do something, or that it is always right to do something.\nSome moral principles are particularistic. Particularistic moral principles hold that something is wrong only if someone has a reason to object. So, if no one is harmed by an action, particularistic moral principles make the action look right.\nOther moral principles are universal. Universal moral principles hold that something is wrong regardless of whether anyone objects. So, even if no one is harmed by an action, universal moral principles make the action look wrong.\nIf a moral principle is neither particularistic nor universal, then it is not a moral principle at all.\nSOLUTION: Find the moral principle that backs up the intuition that wasteful driving is wrong.\nPart of that moral principle is the intuition that wasteful driving is wrong. The other part is a reason to think that the intuition is correct.\nSo, if we cannot find a moral principle to back up our intuition that wasteful driving is wrong, then we do not know whether wasteful driving is wrong."}

Killing can be done by causing death or by failing to prevent it. The wrongness of killing is generally believed to be greater when it is done with less justification.\nA less controversial example of the killing/letting die distinction is withholding medical treatment. Every competent adult has the right to refuse medical treatment. So, a medical treatment that is not urgently needed is not killing or letting die, but rather letting die.\nIn contrast, urgently needed medical treatment that is withheld is usually killing or letting die. For example, if a competent adult refuses a lifesaving operation, the doctors will not perform the operation. However, if the patient is unconscious, the doctors are required to perform the operation.\nThe question of whether the killing/letting die distinction is morally relevant can be posed by asking whether we are equally to blame for allowing people in Third World countries to starve as we would be for\nrefusing to give them the money they need to purchase food.\nIf you decide to withhold food, medicine, or other necessities of life from someone, you are essentially deciding that it is acceptable for that person to die. So, by withholding food, you are letting that person die.\nSOLUTION: Poisoning food is killing. Refusing to give someone the money they need to purchase food is letting die. Withholding medicine that they need to survive is letting die. Depriving them of knowledge they need to produce food is not killing or letting die."}

In the United States, the government is not allowed to stop speech that is offensive or unpopular. There are many reasons why people think freedom of speech is important.\nOne reason is that freedom of speech allows people to share their ideas and opinions with others. This can help people make better decisions. For example, if one candidate is running for office, and the other candidate is spending millions of dollars on ads that are not true, you should know that. You can make a more informed decision about who to vote for.\nAnother reason is that freedom of speech protects people's rights. The U.S. Constitution says that freedom of speech is a right. So, if someone wants to say something, they have the right to say it.\nA viewpoint-biased speech restriction should be troubling to those who value a strong right to privacy, a strong protection for freedom of speech, and equal educational opportunity.\nIf someone is telling you that you can't say something, that person is restricting your freedom of speech. This is a viewpoint-biased speech restriction. It is troubling to those who value a strong right to privacy because it gives the government too much power. The government could stop you from saying something because it is too private.\nIt is also troubling to those who value strong protections for freedom of speech. The First Amendment says that the government can't stop you from saying something. But a viewpoint-biased speech restriction is a type of censorship. Censorship is when the government or other powerful group stops people from saying or doing something.\nAnd it is troubling to those who value equal educational opportunity. Schools have a hard time teaching kids how to think for themselves if the kids are not allowed to hear all sorts of ideas."}

Here are some ways that political parties in the United States have approached government:\nFederalists believe in a strong central government. They think that the central government should have a lot of power. Federalists believe that the central government is important to the country's security. They also believe that the central government can make sure that all parts of the country are treated fairly.\nDemocrats are liberal.

He is considered one of the most influential moral philosophers in history.\nKant believed that the only moral law that applies to all people is the law of universalizability. This means that a maxim, or a rule that you follow, can be a universal law only if it can be applied to everyone without contradiction.\nFor example, if everyone followed the rule \"I will only drive on the side of the road with the flow of traffic,\" then traffic would flow more smoothly. But if everyone followed the rule \"I will only drive on the side of the road with the opposite flow of traffic,\" then there would be chaos. The first rule can be a universal law, but the second rule cannot.\nKant argued that there are two other important principles of morality:\nA person must never treat others as a mere means to an end. Instead, every person must be treated as an end in himself or herself.\nA person must treat himself or herself as an end in himself or herself.\nThese two principles are part of what makes up the law of universalizability.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether an action is morally permissible, look for the maxim of the action. Then ask whether the maxim can be a universal law.\nThe maxim of an action outside of marriage is to masturbate, engage in prostitution, or engage in consensual sexual activity. But each of these actions violates the law of universalizability. For example, if everyone masturbated outside of marriage, then the meaning of marriage would be destroyed.\nTherefore, none of the above are morally permissible on Kant's view."}

However, in euthanasia, the doctor administers the means to end the individual's life. In physician-assisted suicide, the individual ends his or her own life with the aid of the doctor.\nOpponents of physician-assisted suicide argue that it is morally wrong and could lead to abuse, such as pressure from family members to end a person's life.

For example, some species of fish, amphibians, and reptiles reproduce by laying eggs that hatch into offspring that are genetically identical to the parent organism. Other animals reproduce by asexual reproduction, which is a type of cloning. Hydra, a type of animal, reproduces by budding. Each Hydra has a stem with a growth on it. The growth can break off and grow into a new Hydra.\nSOLUTION: Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is the process used to create a cloned animal. First, a cell is taken from the animal to be cloned. Then, the nucleus of the cell is transferred into an egg that has had its own nucleus removed. The egg then grows into a fetus, which can be born.\nSo, the SCNT individual has genetic material primarily from one person instead of two."}

Instead, virtue is a disposition to do the right thing. Virtue is a habit that makes it possible for a person to do the right thing.\nAristotle believed that to be virtuous, a person must have the ability to control his or her emotions. For example, a virtuous person is able to control his anger.\nAristotle thought that virtue was not only about controlling emotions, but also about finding a balance between them. A virtuous person is able to avoid extremes in feeling and action.\nIntellectual knowledge is not the same as virtue. A person may know what is right, but that does not necessarily mean that the person is virtuous. Virtue requires that a person do what is right.\nSOLUTION: To be virtuous, a person must have the ability to control his or her emotions and avoid extremes in feeling and action. Anger is an emotion. If a person is able to control his anger, he is able to control his emotions.\nAristotle does not say that virtue is the ability to ascertain what God would desire. Virtue does not depend on religious beliefs."}

Aquinas believed that human beings have a natural inclination to do good and that they have a duty to realize their potential. To do this, they must live in accord with the moral law.\nAquinas was a medieval Christian who believed that the natural law is known through reason. It is universal and immutable, and it governs the behavior of all beings. Following the natural law is thus necessary for human beings to achieve their purpose.\nAquinas's approach to ethics is based on the notion of virtue. Virtue is a habit of acting in accord with the natural law. Some virtues are intellectual, such as prudence, and some are moral, such as generosity.\nAquinas believed that human beings are rational animals. They have both intellectual and moral virtues. The intellectual virtues are necessary for knowledge, and the moral virtues are necessary for achieving human flourishing.\nAquinas's moral theory is a version of natural law theory. According to natural law theory, the purpose of ethics is to determine how to live in accord with the natural law. A theory that focuses on the natural law as the basis for ethics is a version of natural law theory."}

They are based on the idea that certain practices are risky or harmful.\nFor example, consider the claim that some sexual practices are risky. This claim can be supported in one of two ways. The first way is to argue that engaging in these practices is itself harmful. The second way is to argue that these practices lead to harm. For example, engaging in certain sexual practices might increase the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection. This increase in risk is itself harm. But it is not necessarily harmful to engage in the practices.\nOne important consideration with harm arguments is that they are not always clear on the nature of the harm. This lack of clarity can lead to hidden assumptions.\nFor example, consider the claim that certain sexual practices are immoral. This claim might be based on the idea that these practices are harmful. But harm to whom? This is the hidden assumption. One might assume that the practices are harmful to the people engaging in them. But this is not necessarily the case. The practices may be harmful to others. For example, engaging in certain sexual practices might increase the risk of spreading a sexually transmitted infection.\nAnother hidden assumption is that harm is always bad. This assumption is not always valid. For example, consider the possibility of harming someone in order to save others. In this case, the harm is not always bad."}

One important concept in this topic is the idea that an organism is made up of cells. In an animal, cells form organs, and organs make up the body.\nThe study of the development of an animal begins with a single cell: the fertilized egg. As the fertilized egg grows, it becomes an embryo and then a fetus. The embryo is formed when a sperm fertilizes an egg.\nA sperm and an egg are not embryos. They are cells that fuse to form a fertilized egg.\nA fertilized egg is not an organism. It is a set of cells that has the potential to form an organism.\nOrganisms are made up of many cells. In multicellular organisms, cells do not have all the same functions. This means that different cells form different parts of the organism.\nFor example, in people, skin cells and heart cells are different types of cells. The skin cells form the skin, and the heart cells form the heart."}

Moral judgments are often made about the actions of persons. For example, being kind to others is usually considered a good action, and hurting others is usually considered a bad action.\nThe consequences of an action are what happens as a result of the action. Consequences can be intended or unintended. Intended consequences are what you do something to achieve. Unintended consequences are what happens as a result of an action, but it was not the purpose of the action.\nA concrete object is a material object. Moral judgments are not usually made about concrete objects. For example, a brick is a concrete object, but it is not considered to be right or wrong.\nA person is a human being. People are the beings that have ethical duties. They are the beings whose actions can be judged as right or wrong."}
