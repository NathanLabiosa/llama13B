{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing.

The right atrium and the left atrium are the top chambers. The right ventricle and the left ventricle are the bottom chambers.\nA ventricular septal defect is a heart defect in which there is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. The septum is the muscular wall that separates the right and left ventricles.\nThink about how blood flows through the heart. Blood enters the right atrium from the body. The heart's electrical system causes the muscular walls of the right atrium to contract and pump blood into the right ventricle. The heart's electrical system then causes the muscular walls of the right ventricle to contract and pump blood out to the lungs.\nBecause of the ventricular septal defect, oxygen poor blood from the body is mixed with oxygen rich blood in the left atrium. After that, the blood is pumped into the left ventricle.\nThe left ventricle pumps this mixed blood into the aorta. The aorta is the main artery in the body. It carries the blood to all parts of the body.\nSOLUTION: A ventricular septal defect causes oxygen poor blood to mix with oxygen rich blood. This mixture is pumped into the aorta and then flows out to the body.\nThe oxygen rich blood is pumped into the left atrium. The left atrium then pumps this blood into the left ventricle.\nThe percentage of oxygen in the right atrium is lower. But the percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle is higher. The oxygen rich blood is pumped into the lungs.\nThe percentage of CO2 in the right ventricle is higher. But the percentage of CO2 in the right atrium is lower.

The food we eat contains organic compounds, including sugar, which the body can break down to release energy. This process is called oxidation. The release of energy from organic compounds occurs when the compounds are broken down to form carbon dioxide and water. This release of energy is what makes chemical fuel different from other types of fuel, such as solar or wind power. Chemical fuel can be released to power the body's activities immediately, rather than having to store energy from solar or wind power.\nWhen the body breaks down one gram of glucose, glycogen, or fat, it releases approximately 4.1 kJ (kilojoules) of energy. These three substances are the body's main energy sources. One gram of alcohol releases 2.4 kJ of energy when completely oxidised in the body.\nSo, one gram of glucose releases more energy than one gram of alcohol."}

So, 1 gram of a substance contains 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 atoms.\nTo calculate the number of grams of a product, use the following formula:\ngrams of product = number of atoms of the product / 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 atoms/gram\nIf you are using the formula to calculate the number of grams of a product, make sure that the number of atoms is a number with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nFor example, the number of atoms has a unit of moles. So, the formula shows how many grams of the product are in 1 mole of the product.\nTo use the formula to calculate the number of grams of a product, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Look in the formula. The formula contains two numbers.\nThe number to the right of the formula is the number of grams of the product.\nThe number in the formula is the number of atoms of the product.\nStep 2: Cancel out the units. The units of the number of atoms are in units of moles. So, the number of atoms has a unit of moles. The units of the number to the right of the formula are grams. So, the number of grams also has a unit of grams.\nStep 3: Use the formula. Plug in the number of atoms of the product.\nThe number of grams of the product is equal to the number of atoms of the product / 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 atoms/gram.\nThere are 84 grams of ethane in the reaction. So, the number of atoms of ethane is 84 grams \u00d7 (2 atoms of carbon / gram + 8 atoms of hydrogen / gram) = 168 atoms.\nThe unbalanced reaction of ethane gas to carbon dioxide and water is as follows:\nC2H4 + O2 \u2014> CO2 + H2O. There are 96 atoms of carbon in 84 grams of ethane. So, the number of atoms of carbon in the reaction is 96 atoms. The number of atoms of oxygen is 8 atoms. So, the number of grams of carbon dioxide is 96 atoms / 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 atoms/gram = 156 grams."}
{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, what would be an important thing for a person to do after sauna use?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shower in cold water."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exercise."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eat a meal."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Replenish fluids with filtered water."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": ""}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nThe review article sources a lot of data from Finland population studies, where the incidence of sauna use is substantially higher than most countries.

So, it is more plausible in Finland than elsewhere that there is an increased rate of pets in the household. In fact, the article notes that many Finnish saunas are warmed by a wood stove that is kept warm by a petroleum or electric heater."}

These stages include the oral, anal, phallic, latent, and genital stages.\nIn the oral stage, pleasure is focused on the mouth. Children are born with a natural instinct to put their mouths on their genitals. This is because nursing is the first experience of sexual pleasure. The oral stage begins in the first weeks of life and ends around 18 months.\nIn the anal stage, pleasure is focused on controlling bowel movements. During this stage, which begins around 18 months and ends around 3 years, children discover that they can control their bowel movements. This new discovery brings them a sense of power and independence.\nIn the phallic stage, pleasure is focused on the child's genitals. This stage begins around 3 years of age and ends around 6 years. Children begin to discover that their genitals can produce pleasure. They also begin to feel shame about their genitals.\nIn the latent stage, pleasure is not focused on the body. This stage begins around 6 years of age and ends around puberty. Children become more aware of their social world. They begin to understand social norms and rules.\nIn the genital stage, all of the previous stages come together. This stage begins during puberty and continues throughout a person's life.\nAccording to Freud, people can get stuck at a previous stage of development. This is called fixation. A person who is fixated at a stage may have difficulty with the tasks of that stage.\nFor example, a person who is fixated in the anal stage may have trouble with control. This person may struggle with discipline and organization. A person who is fixated in the phallic stage may have trouble with authority. This person may fight against rules and regulations.\nSOLUTION: According to Freud, a person who is fixated in the anal stage has trouble with control. A person who is fixated in the phallic stage has trouble with authority.\nThe young man is described as inability to keep his house clean. This indicates that he may have trouble with control. So, the young man would be fixated in the anal stage."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nWhich of the following is a likely paragraph that follows this excerpt in the article?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A paragraph on a protein that facilitates intracellular function in response to heat."}, {"label": "B", "text": "A paragraph on increased heart attacks in Eskimo populations."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A recap of Finland\u2019s water polo team excellence."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A study on rats exposed to high levels of heat."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The excerpt discusses the health benefits of sauna use.

This means that if the pressure of a gas increases, the volume of the gas will increase.\nIf the pressure of a gas decreases, the volume of the gas will decrease.\nThe relationship between the pressure and the volume of a gas is described by the ideal gas law. According to the ideal gas law, for a fixed amount of gas, the volume is directly proportional to the pressure at a constant temperature.\nSo, if the pressure of a gas increases, the volume of the gas will increase. And if the pressure of a gas decreases, the volume of the gas will decrease.\nSOLUTION: To determine the volume of a gas at a different pressure, you need to know the value of the pressure and use the ideal gas law.\nThe volume of a gas at 200 atm is 0.1 L. To determine the volume of the gas at 1 atm, use the ideal gas law:\nVolume at 1 atm = Volume at 200 atm / 200\nVolume at 1 atm = 0.1 L / 200\nVolume at 1 atm = 0.005 L\nThis is a decrease in volume. So, the volume of the gas is slightly more than 20 L."}

{"question": "The electron transport chain, which is embedded in the mitochondrial membrane, exists primarily to generate new molecules of ATP for use by the cell. This is accomplished by a positive gradient of H+ ions that are formed outside the membrane which then pass back through a specialized channel known as ATP synthase. The energy created from this phosphorylates an ATP to an ATP, known as oxidative phosphorylation. The mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria is known as what?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Passive transport"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Passive diffusion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Active transport"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Endocytosis"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Membranes are flexible biological membranes that enclose cells and organelles. Membranes are made up of phospholipids, which are amphipathic molecules. The phospholipids in a membrane have a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end. The hydrophilic ends face toward the aqueous cell interior, and the hydrophobic ends face toward the cell membrane exterior. This arrangement creates a boundary across which water cannot pass.\nBecause water cannot cross the membrane, water and other solutes must be transported across the membrane. There are several ways in which this transport can happen.\nPassive diffusion occurs through channels in the membrane. Because the channels are open, solutes can freely enter and leave the cell. Neither special proteins nor energy is required.\nPassive transport also occurs through channels in the membrane. However, the channels are only open in one direction. Solutes move down their concentration gradient into the cell.\nActive transport uses energy from the cell to move solutes against their concentration gradient. Some solutes are actively transported into the cell. Others are actively transported out.\nEndocytosis is the process of engulfing substances from the environment outside the cell. The cell membrane wraps around these substances, forming a small vesicle that contains the substances. The vesicle is then inside the cell.\nExocytosis is the process of secreting substances inside the cell into the environment outside the cell. The cell membrane forms a vesicle that contains the substances. The vesicle then breaks, and the substances are released into the environment.\nSOLUTION: H+ ions are transported from the outside of the mitochondrion to the inside. This is passive transport. A concentration gradient is formed by the process of oxidative phosphorylation, which acts like a pump. The concentration of H+ ions is higher inside the mitochondrion than outside. So, H+ ions move down their concentration gradient into the mitochondrion."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nAccording to the article, which of the following is NOT a benefit of sauna use?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decreased risk of heart attacks."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increase in stroke volume."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Improved mental health."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decreased rate of erectile dysfunction."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Looking at the underlined text, you can tell which benefits are stated.\nMen who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.\n...the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.\n...frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner.\n...men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders."}

{"question": "During DNA replication, mistakes are coded into the leading strand about once every 100,000/1 million copies. This DNA is subject to proofreading by several mechanisms. If a mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed, this would most likely be the work of which repair mechanism?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "DNA polymerase I"}, {"label": "B", "text": "DNA polymerase III"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mismatch repair mechanism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Endonuclease repair"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: DNA replication is a complex process that is essential for life. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase reads the template strand of DNA and assembles a new strand of DNA, the replica strand. Because the template strand is read from 5' to 3', the replica strand is also assembled from 5' to 3'. As the replica strand is assembled, the RNA primer, which is bound to the template strand, is removed.\nIf DNA polymerase encounters a stretch of template strand that contains a mistake, it will remove the RNA primer and start over. This is called discontinuous DNA replication.\nMistakes in the template strand that are not detected by DNA polymerase are called replication errors. If a replication error is detected and fixed later in the cell cycle, it is called a post-replication repair.\nIf a replication error is detected and fixed during replication, it is called a replication repair. There are several replication repair mechanisms.\nOne replication repair mechanism is DNA polymerase I. This enzyme can remove a group of nucleotides from the template strand and replace it with the correct nucleotides. This action is called correcting.\nAnother replication repair mechanism is DNA polymerase III. This enzyme can remove a single incorrect nucleotide from the template strand and replace it with the correct nucleotide. This action is called editing.\nA third replication repair mechanism is mismatch repair. This mechanism can remove a segment of the new strand of DNA that contains a mistake and replace it with the correct segment.\nA fourth replication repair mechanism is endonuclease repair. This mechanism can remove a segment of the new strand of DNA that contains a mistake by cutting the strand and replacing it with the correct segment.\nSOLUTION: The mismatch repair mechanism is responsible for fixing replication errors that are detected and fixed later in the cell cycle. This mechanism is not used during replication.\nThe endonuclease repair mechanism is responsible for fixing replication errors that are detected and fixed during replication. This mechanism can remove a segment of the new strand of DNA that contains a mistake by cutting the strand and replacing it with the correct segment.\nDNA polymerase I is responsible for correcting mistakes. This enzyme can remove a group of nucleotides from the template strand and replace it with the correct nucleotides.\nDNA polymerase III is responsible for editing mistakes. This enzyme can remove a single incorrect nucleotide from the template strand and replace it with the correct nucleotide."}

In glycolysis, the rate limiting enzyme is phosphofructokinase, which phosphorylates fructose to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.\nType II fibres are the predominant fibres in the muscles of distance runners. They have more phosphorylase activity than Type I fibres. Phosphorylase catalyses the breakdown of glycogen into glucose.\nEndurance training increases the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle. The TCA cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, is the next step after glycolysis. It uses pyruvate from glycolysis to generate energy.\nOxygen is consumed in the TCA cycle. When oxygen is present, it is used by cytochrome c oxidase to burn up the pyruvate from glycolysis, generating energy in the form of ATP."}

The descending loop of Henle is permeable to water. This means that water can pass through the descending loop of Henle from the filtrate in the surrounding tubes to the blood in the descending loop of Henle. The descending loop of Henle is impermeable to sodium, potassium, and chloride ions. This means that these ions cannot pass through the descending loop of Henle.\nSOLUTION: The descending loop of Henle is permeable to water. According to the graph, the water permeability of the descending loop of Henle is 1.0. This means that the descending loop of Henle is more permeable to water than the surrounding tubes.\nThe descending loop of Henle is impermeable to sodium, potassium, and chloride ions. According to the graph, the permeability of the descending loop of Henle to these ions is 0.0. This means that these ions cannot pass through the descending loop of Henle."}
