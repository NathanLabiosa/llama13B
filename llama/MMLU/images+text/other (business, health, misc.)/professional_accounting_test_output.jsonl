The discount rate is used because the cash flows are occurring in different years.\nThe discount rate tells you the rate of return you could earn by investing the same amount of money today. Because the project's cash flows are happening in the future, they are worth less today. The bigger the discount rate, the less the future cash flows are worth in today's money.\nThe formula for NPV is:\nNPV = PV of Year 5 cash flow + PV of Year 10 cash flow\nThe formulas for present value use the discount rate. For example, the formula for the present value of a cash flow in year t is:\nPV of cash flow in year t = cash flow in year t / (1 + r)^t\nwhere r is the discount rate and t is the year the cash flow will be received.\nPlug in the numbers for the present value of the Year 5 and Year 10 cash flows.\nPV of Year 5 cash flow = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^5\nPV of Year 10 cash flow = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^10"}

This is because the straight-line method provides a constant amount of amortization each year.\nFor example, if a bond with a $10,000 premium is amortized over 5 years using a 6% straight-line rate, the annual amortization is $2,000. In year 5, the bond carrying amount is $8,000, and the remaining amortization is $1,000.\nThe effective interest method, in contrast, provides a declining amount of amortization each year. For example, using the effective interest rate of 6%, the bond carrying amount in year 5 is $9,404, and the remaining amortization is $596.\nSo, the straight-line method overstates the bond carrying amount and understates earnings.\nSOLUTION: At June 30 year 12, the bond is overstated, and earnings are understated.

When you buy a bond, you lend money to the company or government that issues the bond. In exchange, the issuer agrees to pay you interest for as long as the bond is outstanding.\nThe price of a bond is the amount of money you pay to buy it. The face value of a bond is the amount of money that the bond will pay when it matures.\nYield is the amount of interest a bond pays relative to its face value. Yield goes up when the price of the bond goes down.\nSOLUTION: The price of a bond that pays no coupons is simply the face value of the bond. A five-year bond pays no coupons, so the face value is $100.\nThe yield of the bond is 4%. That means the bond will pay $4 in interest for every $100 you pay for the bond. So, the bond will cost $100 + $4 = $104."}

A partner can sell or give away his or her partnership interest, but the partnership itself cannot be sold or given away.\nWhen a partner sells his or her partnership interest, the partnership does not terminate. The partnership can continue until the end of the tax year.\nWhen a partner dies, the partnership may terminate for tax purposes. This happens if the partnership is a general partnership and the partnership interest is transferred after the partner's death. This happens if the partnership is a limited partnership and the partnership interest is transferred to a person who is not a limited partner after the partner's death.\nThe partnership may also terminate for tax purposes if the only partners are brothers or sisters, or if the partnership is a general partnership and the partners are a husband and wife.\nSOLUTION: Stone sold his partnership interest to Taylor. The partnership did not terminate. April 9 was the date of the sale. So, Studio did not terminate as of April 9."}

It can also help simplify the overall system landscape.\nSOLUTION: The best long-term solution is to adopt the fixed asset module of the new system for integration.\nThe current fixed asset process is already on a password-protected spreadsheet. This process will need to be replaced eventually because spreadsheet-based processes are hard to integrate with other systems.\nA stand-alone fixed asset program is a self-contained system that is not integrated with other systems. This type of solution is easier to implement in the short term, but it may not be the most effective or efficient choice in the long term.\nDeveloping a new fixed asset system is a custom solution. This type of solution is expensive and time-consuming to implement. It is also hard to maintain and upgrade.\nPurchasing a stand-alone fixed asset program is a low-risk choice because it is a self-contained system. However, this type of solution is not as effective or efficient as an enterprise-wide system."}

The right exists under the Delaware General Corporation Law, which is the law of the state where most public corporations are incorporated. The statute allows a shareholder to inspect the corporation's books and records, but it also sets out limitations on the right.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law does not require that the demanding shareholder own a specific amount of stock. The law does not require that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose. And the law does not limit the right to inspect to situations where fraud or illegality is alleged.\nSOLUTION: The correct statement about a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records is that the right exists when fraud or illegality is alleged. This is a limitation on the right to inspect. If fraud or illegality is not alleged, the right to inspect is much broader."}

Step 4 is to communicate deficiencies in the design of internal control to the entity's audit committee. Step 5 is to examine trend analysis to determine the appropriateness of the CPA's assessment of detection risk. Step 6 is to evaluate management's plans for dealing with negative trends and financial difficulties."}

It is usually reported on the same date as the cost of goods sold.\nWhen you buy merchandise on credit, you increase your accounts payable. When you sell merchandise on credit, you increase your accounts receivable.\nBoth merchandise inventory and accounts payable are current assets. They are usually listed as separate line items on a company's balance sheet.\nA company's budget should include two types of outlays: cash outlays and credit outlays.\nCash outlays include amounts paid in cash or by check.\nCredit outlays include amounts outlaid but not yet paid. The credit outlays are shown on the balance sheet as accounts payable.\nA company's budget should also include an estimate of the total outlays for the period. This estimate is called the total outlays budget. The total outlays budget is a function of the cash outlays budget and the credit outlays budget.\nThe cash outlays budget is equal to the total outlays budget. This is because all outlays are paid in cash.\nThe credit outlays budget is equal to the total outlays budget minus the cash outlays budget. This is because all outlays are paid in cash.\nSOLUTION: The cost of goods sold is the total cost of the merchandise a company sells. It is usually reported on the income statement.\nThe merchandise inventory is the cost of the merchandise a company has on hand. It is usually reported on the balance sheet.\nThe accounts payable for purchases is the amount a company owes its vendors for merchandise it has bought on credit. It is usually reported on the balance sheet.\nThe merchandise inventory increased by $100,000 from June 1 to June 30. So, the cost of goods sold is $100,000 higher than the accounts payable for purchases.\nThe accounts payable for purchases increased by $50,000 from June 1 to June 30.

In these cases, the errors are corrected by recording adjusting entries.\nAn adjusting entry is made to an asset or a liability account at the beginning or end of an accounting period. Adjusting entries are made to reflect transactions that were not recorded appropriately in the accounting system.\nThe amount of an adjusting entry is determined by the amount of the error and the accounting principle that was violated.\nFor example, if a company errors in recording a transaction, the error may not affect the total amount of cash that the company has. In this case, the adjusting entry would be made to the cash account.\nIf the error affects the cost of goods sold, the adjusting entry would be made to the cost of goods sold account.\nAn adjusting entry may also affect other accounts, such as inventory or income.\nWhen preparing financial statements for the first time, companies should follow these steps:\n1. Identify the transactions that were not recorded appropriately.\n2. Determine the error and the accounting principle that was violated.\n3. Determine the amount of the error.\n4. Record the adjusting entry.\n5. Review the financial statements to ensure that they are accurate and comply with accounting principles.\nSOLUTION: The amount of the error is $90,000.\nThe error affects the year 2 statement of financial position.\nThe $90,000 loss accrual was not recorded in the year 2 statement of financial position.

The quantity is usually listed in hours, and the cost is usually listed in dollars per hour.\nYou will often need to budget for indirect materials and indirect labor as well. Indirect materials are items that are not used directly in producing the product, but that are necessary for production. Indirect labor is the labor that is not directly involved in producing the product.\nSOLUTION: To determine how many units should be produced during the first quarter, you need to calculate how many units are in ending inventory.\nThe quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of each quarter is to equal 30% of the next quarter's budgeted sales of units. So, the quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of the first quarter will be 30% of the first quarter's budgeted sales.\nThe budgeted sales for the first quarter are 30,000 units. To calculate the ending inventory for the first quarter, you need to multiply the budgeted sales by the percentage that makes the quantity of finished goods inventory equal to the budgeted sales.\n30,000 units x 30% = 9,000 units\nSo, the production budget should show $9,000 for units to be produced during the first quarter."}

Auditors also consider the company's historical financial statements and any other relevant information.\nThe risk of financial statement fraud is a function of the nature of the fraud and the auditor's assessment of the risks of the entity's financial statements. The nature of the fraud includes the objectives of the fraud and the methods used to commit it. The risks of the entity's financial statements include the risks of material misstatement and the risks of fraud.\nMaterial misstatement refers to an error that is large enough to affect the decisions of users of the financial statements.\nAuditors assess the risks of material misstatement by considering the materiality of the entity and the industry in which it operates. Materiality depends on the size of the entity and the nature of its operations. Materiality also depends on the specific financial statement accounts and the nature of their intentional misstatements.\nFor example, an intentional misstatement of expenses is more likely to be material in a small entity than in a large entity. An intentional misstatement of asset accounts is more likely to be material in an entity that relies on its assets for financing than in an entity that generates most of its cash flow from operations.\nThe risks of fraud are affected by the industry in which the entity operates. For example, the risks of fraud are generally higher in industries with a high-risk profile.\nThe financial statement accounts with the highest risks of fraud are typically revenue and earnings per share.\nThe presence of red flags, such as a significant increase in sales in December followed by a decrease in January, indicates a potential for fraud in sales revenue. Red flags may indicate that the increase in sales is the result of fraud rather than legitimate business operations.\nSOLUTION: There is a broad indication of financial reporting fraud. A significant increase in sales in December followed by a decrease in January may be a red flag for fraud."}

It is calculated by dividing the company's net income by the number of outstanding shares of its stock.\nFor example, if a company has net income of $100,000 and 5,000 shares of common stock outstanding, its earnings per share would be $20.00.\nIf a company has net income of $100,000 and 5,000 shares of common stock outstanding, its earnings per share would be $20.00.\nThere are two types of stock: common and preferred.\nCommon stock is the most basic type of stock. If a company does well, the value of its common stock tends to go up. But if the company does poorly, the value of its common stock tends to go down.\nPreferred stock pays a set amount of dividends, or dividends that increase at a set rate. The value of preferred stock is generally considered to be more stable than that of common stock.\nDividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders. When a company earns a profit, it can choose to pay some of those profits to its shareholders as a dividend.\nSOLUTION: Toft Co. had 120,000 shares of common stock outstanding at January 1. On April 1, it issued 40,000 additional shares of common stock.\nSo, Toft had 120,000 + 40,000 = 160,000 shares of common stock outstanding during the year.\nToft declared a dividend of $5 per share on 10,000 shares of nonconvertible preferred stock. The dividend was declared and paid during the year.\nSo, Toft paid $5 per share for each of the 10,000 shares of preferred stock.\nToft's net income for the year was $480,000. The income statement shows the company's financial performance for the year. It lists the company's income and expenses and the taxes it paid.\nThe income statement shows that Toft's net income for the year was $480,000.\nEPS is calculated by dividing the net income by the number of outstanding shares of stock.\nThe income statement shows that Toft had 160,000 shares of common stock outstanding during the year. So, Toft's earnings per share for the year is $480,000 \u00f7 160,000 shares = $2.87."}

Depreciation is the term used to describe the process of allocating the decrease in value of an asset to the periods in which it is used.\nThe method of depreciation can affect how much a company charges its customers for a product or service, and it can also affect the company's tax liability. Different methods of depreciation can also affect the company's reported profit.\nThere are several methods of decepreciation. Some methods allocate the decline in value to the assets as if the assets were being bought and sold each year. Other methods allocate the decline in value based on the assets' expected remaining useful life.\nThe double-declining method is a function of the asset's initial cost and its expected remaining useful life. Under this method, the depreciation expense for the first year is the asset's initial cost minus its expected salvage value. For each subsequent year, the depreciation expense is the asset's remaining book value from the previous year minus its expected salvage value divided by its expected remaining useful life.\nThe depreciation expense for the year ended December 31 using the double-declining method of depreciation is $8,000. This is the asset's remaining book value from May 1 of the current year minus its expected salvage value."}

This decline in value is called amortization. Amortization expense is the cost of the amortization.\nAmortization expense is computed as the cost of the asset minus the current value of the asset.\nThe current value of the asset is the asset's beginning value minus the amortization expense for previous years.\nIf the asset is going to be used for a specific period of time, such as five years, then the amortization expense for each year is the asset's cost divided by its expected useful life.\nSOLUTION: The legal life of the copyright is the life of the author plus 50 years. The author's life is not given, but it is likely that the author is currently alive. So, the legal life of the copyright is at least 51 years.\nThe asset's cost is $20,000. The asset's expected useful life is five years. So, the amortization expense for each year is $20,000 divided by 5 years, or $4,000.\nThe current value of the asset is the asset's beginning value minus the amortization expense for previous years. The beginning value is $20,000. So, the current value of the asset is $20,000 minus $4,000, or $16,000."}

This is because a dollar received in the future can be invested to earn interest.\nThe present value of a future dollar is less than the future dollar. The amount by which the present value is less is equal to the interest rate.\nFor example, if the interest rate is 10%, a dollar received in the future is worth only 90 cents today. If the interest rate is 20%, a dollar received in the future is worth only 80 cents today.\nThe net present value of a series of future cash inflows is the sum of the present values of those inflows.\nThe net present value of an investment with a 10% discount rate is higher when the discount rate is lower.\nSOLUTION: The net present value of an investment is the sum of the present values of the cash inflows.\nThe present value of each cash inflow is $3,000 / (1 + 0.10) = $2,909.09.\nThe net present value is the sum of the present values of the cash inflows.\nSo, the net present value is $2,909.09 + $2,909.09 = $5,818.18."}

This change would allow customers to take longer to pay their invoices.\nSOLUTION: Increasing the credit period would likely result in higher profits. The reason is that, by allowing customers to take longer to pay invoices, the company is likely to sell more products. This is because it is easier for customers to pay invoices when they have more time."}

For example, management may engage in fraudulent financial reporting if they believe that the potential gains are greater than the potential penalties or fees for misrepresentation.\nFraudulent financial reporting is a serious issue that can lead to a loss of investor confidence and, in some cases, financial collapse. To address this issue, auditors assess the risk of material misstatements arising from fraud when planning an audit.\nSome factors that increase the risk of material misstatements arising from fraud include the following:\n-Audit client is in a declining industry.\n-Audit client has a history of fraud.\n-There is a high degree of uncertainty about the audit client's future.\n-The audit client has a complex financial structure.\n-The audit client has a history of rapid growth.\n-There are significant changes in the audit client's personnel.\n-The audit client has a highly motivated and capable management team.\n-The audit client is experiencing financial difficulties.\nSOLUTION: Equipment is often sold at a loss before being fully depreciated. is a characteristic that would heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting. This behavior can be a indication of fraud.\nA declining industry or a history of fraud may also heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting. However, these factors do not necessarily indicate that fraud has occurred.\nBank reconciliations usually include in-transit deposits is a characteristic that makes it less likely that material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting will occur. In-transit deposits are not included in the bank reconciliation process.\nEmployees who handle cash receipts are not bonded is a characteristic that makes it less likely that material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting will occur. A bond would compensate the employer for any losses incurred as a result of the employees' actions."}

It is calculated as the weighted average of the costs of the company's different sources of capital.\nThe weights are the proportions of each source of capital in the company's capital structure.\nFor example, if a company has $100 million in debt and $100 million in equity, the weighted average cost of capital is calculated as follows:\nCost of debt = 5%\nCost of equity = 8%\nWeighted-average cost of capital = (5% x $100 million) + (8% x $100 million) = 5.8%\nThe weighted-average cost of capital is used as a benchmark for evaluating potential investments. If the expected return on a potential investment is greater than the weighted-average cost of capital, the investment is worth considering.\nSOLUTION: To calculate Merritt Co.'s weighted-average cost of capital, first calculate the after-tax cost of debt and the cost of equity.\nThen, use the following formula:\nWeighted-average cost of capital = (Cost of debt x Debt) + (Cost of equity x Equity)\nCost of debt = pretax cost of debt x (1 - tax rate)\nDebt = total debt\nEquity = total equity\nThe table below shows the values needed to calculate Merritt Co.'s weighted-average cost of capital.\nAssistant: Calculations:\nThe pretax cost of debt is 5%, and the tax rate is 21%.\nSo, the after-tax cost of debt is 5% x (1 - 21%) = 4%.\nThe debt is $80 million. The total debt is $100 million. So, the debt is 80% of $100 million.\nThe equity is $20 million. The total equity is $100 million. So, the equity is 20% of $100 million.\nWeighted-average cost of capital = (Cost of debt x Debt) + (Cost of equity x Equity)\n= (4% x $100 million) + (10% x $100 million)\n= 4% + 10%\n= 14%"}

Compilation engagements are performed in accordance with Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs).\nThe objective of a compilation engagement is to assist management in presenting financial statements that are representative of its operations. During a compilation engagement, the accountant evaluates whether the financial statements are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nIf the accountant becomes aware of a lack of segregation of duties in the entity's accounting and payroll departments, the engagement should not be accepted. A lack of segregation of duties could lead to incorrect financial statements, and the accountant should not be associated with the preparation of financial statements that are not presented in conformity with GAAP.\nSubstantially all of the disclosures required by GAAP is a matter of professional judgment. If the accountant determines that the omission of disclosures would be material to the users of the financial statements, the engagement should not be accepted.\nCompilation engagements are considered acceptable for nonissuers, such as not-for-profit organizations and employee benefit plans. An nonissuer's financial statements are not required to be filed with a governmental agency.\nAn acknowledgement that the financial statements will be included in a written personal financial plan is not a factor that would prevent an accountant from accepting an engagement to compile the financial statements of a nonissuer."}

The auditor considers the nature of the client's business, the industry in which the client operates, and the specific areas of financial statements that the auditor believes may be at higher risk of material misstatement. The auditor also considers the effectiveness of the client's internal controls.\nThe auditor then plans the audit so that the audit procedures respond to the assessed risk. For example, if the auditor believes that there is a high risk of material misstatement in the client's inventory, the auditor may decide to test the client's internal controls over inventory by performing a test of controls. The test of controls is a procedure that the auditor performs to assess the effectiveness of the client's controls.\nIn assessing the tolerable rate of deviations of a test of controls that was performed using statistical sampling, the auditor should consider that deviations from pertinent controls do not affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records. The tolerable rate of deviations is the rate at which the auditor is willing to tolerate that the test of controls deviates from the expected results. The tolerable rate of deviations is a function of the degree of assurance the auditor is aiming to achieve and the level of sampling risk the auditor is willing to accept.\nWhen the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high, the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk. High sampling risk makes it more likely that the test of controls will materially deviate from the expected results. The auditor can assess the level of sampling risk by considering the nature of the account balance or transaction and the likelihood of errors or fraud.\nIncreasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations. This is because the more items that are selected, the more confident the auditor can be that the test of controls is effective.\nDeviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate. This means that the auditor can tolerate a higher rate of deviations when the rate of deviation is lower."}

A company faces many such events, such as lawsuits, warranties, or pending insurance claims. Because these events can affect a company's financial position, accountants prepare for them by accruing expenses or setting aside assets.\nAn expense is accrued when it is probable that the expense will be incurred and the amount of the expense can be estimated. Unlike prepaid expenses, which are expenses that have been paid in advance, contingent liabilities are not prepaid.\nA company can accrue a contingent liability by setting aside a portion of the amount that it is probable it will be required to pay.

When the inflation premium falls, the cost of equity decreases.\nSOLUTION: The expected dividend is $5, and the dividend growth rate is 3%. So, the expected dividend next year is $5 + 3 = $8.\nThe inflation rate is expected to fall from 5% per year to 3% per year. So, the inflation premium is expected to decrease.\nThe cost of equity is the sum of the dividend yield and the growth rate of the dividend.\nFor a company, the cost of equity is likely to decrease when the dividend yield and the growth rate of the dividend increase.\nWhen the cost of equity decreases, the stock price decreases."}

A debt security is a security that promises to pay a fixed sum of money at a future date.\nA held-to-maturity security is a debt security that the company believes it will be able to hold until it matures. For a held-to-maturity security, the company uses the amortized cost method to calculate interest income. The amortized cost method means that the company spreads interest income over the life of the security.\nAn available-for-sale security is a debt security that the company may buy and sell in the future. For an available-for-sale security, the company uses the fair value method to calculate interest income. The fair value method means that the company uses the current market value of the security to calculate interest income.\nThe company must also use the fair value method to calculate interest income on an available-for-sale debt security if it plans to sell the security before it matures.\nThe company must recognize unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in a separate component of shareholders' equity.\nA held-to-maturity security is not included in the separate component of shareholders' equity.\nSOLUTION: An available-for-sale debt security is a debt security that the company may buy and sell in the future. For an available-for-sale security, the company uses the fair value method to calculate interest income.\nThe fair value of the available-for-sale debt security is $30,000. This means that the debt security has a fair value greater than its cost basis. So, the debt security has an unrealized gain.\nThe unrealized gain is $10,000. This is the difference between the fair value of the available-for-sale debt security and its cost basis.\nDodd's income tax rate was 20%. The unrealized gain is taxable.

This is because not all assets are revalued every year. Instead, some assets are revalued only when their value changes.\nWhen an asset is revalued, the change in value is generally recognized in other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income is a part of equity, on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. You should not include other comprehensive income in the calculation of profit or loss.\nIf an asset is revalued and the increase in value is recognized in other comprehensive income, the change in value is also deferred in the following year.

Dividends are usually paid as cash payments to shareholders.\nA company's dividend growth rate is the percentage change in its dividend payment from one year to the next. Over time, the dividend growth rate can have a big impact on a company's stock price.\nA company's stock price is influenced by the expected value of its future dividends. Because dividends are paid out over time, the value of these future dividends is included in the stock price today.\nA company's equity, or investment, in its business is worth the present value of its expected future dividends. The expected future dividends are discounted to their present value using the company's cost of equity capital.\nIf a company's dividend growth rate is expected to be less in the future than it was in the past, the present value of its expected future dividends will be lower. This means that the stock price today will be less than the cost of the company's equity.\nIf a company's dividend growth rate is expected to be greater in the future than it was in the past, the present value of its expected future dividends will be higher. This means that the stock price today will be greater than the cost of the company's equity.\nSOLUTION: To ensure that the price is consistent with the pricing of a growing perpetuity, the dividend growth rate must be 16%.\nIf the dividend growth rate is 16%, the price of the company's equity will be equal to its cost of equity capital."}

It involves selecting a sample from a population and evaluating the results to determine if any control issues exist. The sample is drawn from the population using a statistical technique called a sample design. A sample design can be designed to ensure that the sample is representative of the population, in which case it is called a stratified sample. Or, the sample can be designed to ensure that the sample is as homogeneous as possible, in which case it is called a simple random sample.\nThe auditor's decision on how to proceed with testing would be influenced by the risks associated with the controls. The following factors can affect the auditor's assessment of the risks associated with controls:\nThe nature of the control, including the extent to which it is designed to prevent or detect errors or fraud.\nThe frequency of the control, including whether it is designed to catch errors or fraud in real time or after the fact.\nThe degree to which the control is tested, including whether it is tested by someone outside the area being controlled.\nThe presence of any red flags, including indications of previous fraud or error.\nThe tolerable risk, including the maximum amount of misstatement the auditor is willing to accept.\nIf the auditor identifies control deficiencies in the sample, the auditor's assessment of the risk associated with the controls is increased. This means that the auditor is less confident that the controls are operating effectively.\nIf the sample results indicate that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate, it means that the auditor is not able to conclude that the controls are operating effectively. In this case, the auditor would be required to reduce the assessed level of control risk.\nThe auditor's planning should not increase the assessed level of control risk. If the auditor's planning is ineffective, the assessed level of control risk would increase. For example, if the auditor's prescribed control is ineffective, the assessed level of control risk would increase.\nThe auditor's substantive tests are designed to determine whether the population is in compliance with the control objective. The significance of the substantive tests is that they provide evidence that the population is in compliance with the control objective. If the substantive tests are not judged to be substantive, the auditor's assessment of the risk associated with the controls is increased. As a result, the assessed level of control risk is increased."}

An internal auditor cannot be objective if they are biased or have a conflict of interest.\nIn order to determine whether the internal auditor is objective, the independent auditor should consider whether the internal auditor's procedures are properly designed and implemented. The independent auditor can do this by performing the following procedures:\nReviewing the internal audit work plan to determine whether it is properly designed to address the company's risk factors.\nInspecting the work papers to determine whether the procedures were properly performed.\nReviewing the internal auditor's reports to determine whether the conclusions and recommendations are appropriate.\nIf the independent auditor identifies a lack of objectivity, they should consider whether the internal auditor's lack of objectivity was material. A lack of objectivity is material if it could affect the internal auditor's procedures or conclusions.\nIf the internal auditor's lack of objectivity is material, the independent auditor should consider whether to communicate with the company's management about the internal auditor's objectivity. The independent auditor's communication should describe the lack of objectivity and explain the effect of the lack of objectivity on the internal auditor's procedures or conclusions.\nIf the internal auditor's lack of objectivity is not material, the independent auditor's communication with the company's management is not required.\nPolicies that prohibit the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed in key management positions could be indicators of a lack of objectivity. However, the independent auditor should first consider whether the policies have a material effect on the internal auditor's objectivity before communicating with the company's management."}

It is also a direct reduction of net income.\nThe inventory turnover is a measure of the number of times that the company sells and replaces its inventory during the year.\nThe inventory turnover formula is:\nInventory turnover = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory\n= Cost of goods sold / (Inventory at beginning of year + Inventory at end of year) / 2\nThe average inventory is the average of the inventory at the beginning of the year and the inventory at the end of the year.\nSOLUTION: To calculate the inventory turnover, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Calculate the cost of goods sold.\nBaxter Co. sold $500,000 worth of goods. The cost of these goods is not given, but it can be calculated by multiplying the cost of goods sold by the inventory turnover.\nCost of goods sold / Inventory turnover = $500,000 / (1.5)\nStep 2: Calculate the average inventory.\nThe average inventory is the average of the inventory at the beginning of the year and the inventory at the end of the year. The average inventory is $200,000 + $300,000 / 2 = $250,000.\nCost of goods sold / Inventory turnover = $500,000 / (1.5) = $333,333 / 1.5 = $222,222\nStep 3: Determine the inventory turnover.\nThe inventory turnover is the cost of goods sold / average inventory.\nInventory turnover = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory = $222,222 / $250,000 = 0.888.\nThe inventory turnover is 0.888, or 88.8%."}

Efficient controls are designed to prevent or detect errors or fraud. Inefficient controls may fail to do one or both of these.\nSome controls are likely to be highly efficient, while others are likely to be highly inefficient. For example, a highly efficient control for protecting cash might be a control that requires multiple custodians to count the cash and compare their counts to one another. A highly inefficient control for protecting cash might be a control that simply requires the custodian to sign for the cash.\nThe overall assessed level of control risk is based on the auditor's assessment of the efficiency of internal controls. The higher the assessed level of control risk, the more likely the auditor is to conclude that a material misstatement has occurred."}

Based upon the following table what action should Skytop take regarding acquisition of the machine and why? Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $1.464 Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $0.683 Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $4.641 Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $3.170 Acquire: Reason:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes Net cash flow is $20000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yes Net future value is $36025"}, {"label": "C", "text": "No Net present value is ($750)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No Net present value is ($8750)"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When considering a major capital project, companies usually evaluate potential projects over their entire economic life. For each year of the project, they estimate the investment costs and the expected cash inflows. For each cash inflow, they calculate a present value using the project's cost of capital. For each present value, they calculate the net present value by subtracting the investment costs. The sign of the net present value indicates whether the project is a financially positive investment.\nIf the net present value is positive, the project is financially positive. If the net present value is negative, the project is financially negative. If the net present value is zero, the project's earnings are equal to its investment costs.\nSOLUTION: To acquire the machine, Skytop will need to invest $80,000. The machine will produce uniform cash inflows of $25,000 for four years.\nFor the machine to be financially positive, the net present value of the machine's cash inflows must be greater than the investment cost.\nNet present value of cash inflows = PV of $25,000 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% = $3.170.\nThe net present value of the machine's cash inflows is less than the investment cost. Therefore, the machine is not financially positive."}

If Dawn had allocated the variances to work in process finished goods and cost of goods sold instead what would have been the effects on current ratio and net income? Current Net ratio income", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increases Increases"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increases Decreases"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Decreases Increases"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decreases Decreases"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A company can use different methods to allocate manufacturing overhead costs to individual products. Two common methods are the traditional cost system and the standard cost system.\nIn a traditional cost system, the actual amount of manufacturing overhead charged to each product is equal to the actual amount of manufacturing overhead incurred. The traditional cost system is simple to operate, but it does not consider how each product affects the overall company.\nIn a standard cost system, the actual amount of manufacturing overhead charged to each product is based on the estimated manufacturing overhead rate. The estimated rate is calculated by dividing the total estimated manufacturing overhead cost by the total estimated manufacturing hours. The standard cost system considers how each product affects the overall company.\nVariances can occur in a standard cost system when the actual manufacturing overhead incurred is different from the amount that was actually charged to products. There are two types of manufacturing overhead variances:\nLabor efficiency variance: Occurs when the actual hours of labor are different from the standard hours.\nLabor rate variance: Occurs when the actual rate for labor is different from the standard rate.\nIf Dawn Corp. had allocated the variances to work in process and finished goods, it would have increased the actual amount of manufacturing overhead charged to those products. This would have increased the current ratio and net income.\nThe current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Allocating the variances to work in process and finished goods would have increased both the current assets and current liabilities. Since the current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities, the increase in current assets would be larger than the increase in current liabilities. So, the current ratio would increase.\nNet income is calculated by subtracting total costs and expenses from total revenue. Allocating the variances to work in process and finished goods would have increased total costs and expenses. Since total revenue did not change, net income would increase."}
