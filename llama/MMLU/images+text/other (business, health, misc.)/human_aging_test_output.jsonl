Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.\nInherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.\nAcquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring.\nThe question of whether traits change with age is complex. Some traits, such as riding a bicycle, do not change with age. Other traits, such as wrinkling, are caused by the environment. But most important, inherited traits do not change with age. This means that genes, which contain the instructions for inherited traits, do not change."}

They are a signal that something is happening in society. For example, if the death rate for heart disease goes up, it is a signal that more people are dying from heart disease.\nLeading indicators can provide important information for predicting future trends. For example, if the death rate for heart disease is going up, it is a signal that the next generation may have a higher probability of dying from heart disease.\nSome causes of death are more sensitive to changes than others. Homicide is a highly sensitive cause of death. A change in the homicide rate is a signal that something has happened in society. For example, if the homicide rate goes up, it is a signal that there may have been an increase in violence in that society.\nOther causes of death are less sensitive to changes. Cardiovascular diseases are a less sensitive cause of death. A change in the death rate for cardiovascular diseases is a signal that something has happened in society, but it may take much longer for the change to show up in the death rate. For example, if more people in a society are dying from cancer, it is a signal that something is happening in that society. But it is also possible that the death rate for cancer has always been high in that society.\nSOLUTION: Look at the chart.\nThe death rate for Alzheimer's has gone up a lot in the past decade. This is a huge increase.\nOther causes of death have not shown such a large increase."}

It is an illness that can be caught from other people.\nThere are many ways that people can get AIDS. Some of the most common ways are through sexual behavior and sharing needles.\nThere is no known cure for AIDS. But there are now many medicines that people with AIDS can take to live longer, healthier lives.\nAll deaths from AIDS were counted as AIDS deaths in the past. But in the year 2016, the authorities changed the way that AIDS deaths are counted. Now, only the people who died from AIDS get counted as AIDS deaths. But during their lives, these people may have died from other causes that were not actually caused by AIDS.\nThis change in counting rules means that there are now fewer AIDS deaths. But it does not mean that AIDS is less of a threat.\nThe number of deaths from accidents has gone down since the year 2000.\nIn 2016, accidents were the fourth leading cause of death.\nKidney diseases are the 10th most common cause of death.\nIn the United States, 1 in 3 people have chronic kidney disease.\nSepticemia is a blood disease.

One of the keys to understanding how natural selection works is to understand how organisms survive and reproduce.\nOrganisms that survive and reproduce are more likely to have offspring that also survive and reproduce. This is how traits get passed from parents to offspring.\nWhen there are many organisms in an environment, some of the organisms will have traits that are better adapted to that environment. Because these organisms are better adapted, they are likely to have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing.\nAs a result of natural selection, traits that are better adapted to an environment will become more common in a population. Over many generations, adaptations can be acquired by a population. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.\nSome adaptations are acquired during a organism's life.

A random sample is a group of people chosen in a way that each person in the population has an equal chance of being chosen.\nSurveys can be conducted by phone, online, or face-to-face.\nSome questions require you to calculate percentages. For example, you may be asked to find out what percentage of people in a certain age group support a particular issue. To do this, use the following formula:\npercentage = number of people who support the issue / total number of people in the age group\nFor example, if 10 out of 25 people in an age group support a issue, and there are 100 people in the age group, then the percentage of people in the age group who support the issue is 10 / 100 = 0.1, or 10%.\nSOLUTION: To find the correct percentage, you need to decide which group says a bridge job is better than their career job. LECTURE: A bridge job is a temporary job that provides income until a person can find a permanent job.\nLess than 25% of people who have had bridge jobs say it was better than their career job. So, the correct percentage is less than 25%."}
