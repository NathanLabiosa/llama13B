They are based on the principles of mutual consent and agreements made by both parties.\nEmployment laws are created by Parliament to set out the general rules for employment. They apply to all employees and employers in the United Kingdom.\nSome laws are open to interpretation. For example, the law says that employees must accept reasonable offers of work. What is reasonable will vary from case to case. So, an employer will need to show that the work offered is not too demanding, too expensive, or too far away.\nOther laws are more specific. For example, the law says that the minimum age for work is 13. But the law also says that children cannot work in hazardous jobs.\nThe rights and duties of employees and employers are set out in detail in employment laws. Some of the major areas these laws cover include:\nthe minimum working age\nthe minimum wage\nrest breaks\nannual leave\nunfair dismissal\ndiscrimination.\nThese laws help to protect the rights of workers and to ensure that employers comply with their obligations.\nSOLUTION: Employer duties is the answer.\nEmployers have certain obligations towards their employees, such as paying their employees at least the minimum wage and following his or her contract.\nEmployee rights are the obligations of workers towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws.\nEmployee rights include the right to be paid a minimum wage, to receive rest breaks, and to be free from discrimination.\nEmployee duties are the obligations of workers towards their employer.\nEmployee duties include the duty to show up for work on time, to do what they are told to do, and to treat colleagues with respect."}

While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:\nIdeas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?\nOrganization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?\nVoice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?\nSentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?\nWord choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?\nGrammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?\nSOLUTION: The best model is the Anglo-American model. This model is considered the best model in light of the recession in the late 2000 s. The Anglo-American model is based on the view that the best way to organize a market economy is through the free exchange of goods and services.\nThis model is not perfect, however. For example, it is based on the assumption that the rules of the market are fixed. In reality, however, the rules of the market can change. In particular, the rules can become less fair. For example, a company may use its power to influence the rules in its favor. This can make the market less fair for other companies."}

They may have the opportunity to build stronger relationships with colleagues and employers, and they may have access to more comprehensive benefits.\nSOLUTION: The question describes gig economy as a specific task or project. It also notes that this work arrangement results in flexibility for businesses, increased risk for those employed in such a manner, uncertainty, and a lack of social welfare structures.\nChoice \"Flexibility\" describes the work arrangement.\nChoice \"Risk\" describes the outcome.\nChoice \"Autonomy\" describes the work arrangement.\nChoice \"Social welfare structures\" describes the outcome."}

According to this theory, people came together and agreed to follow a set of rules and to follow the leadership of a central authority.\nThe term social contract was first used by the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes in the 17 th century. Hobbes believed that people were motivated by self-interest and that they gave up some of their freedom to a central authority in order to protect themselves from others who might use force against them.\nThe French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau also wrote about a social contract. He believed that people were not motivated by self-interest, but rather by a sense of belonging to a community. According to Rousseau, people came together and agreed to follow a set of rules in order to establish a society that would promote the common good.\nThe concept of a social contract is important in political theory because it helps to explain the relationship between the individual and the state. It is also important in business because it helps to explain the relationship between the individual and the organization.\nDuty ethics is a theory that describes what is right or wrong in terms of an individual's duty. According to this theory, an action is right if it fulfills an individual's duty, and an action is wrong if it fails to fulfill an individual's duty.\nDuty ethics was first described by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. According to Kant, individuals have a duty to treat others as ends in themselves, not as means to achieving their own ends.\nConsequentialism is a theory that describes what is right or wrong in terms of the consequences of an action. According to this theory, an action is right if it has good consequences, and an action is wrong if it has bad consequences.\nConsequentialism comes in different forms. One of the most common forms is utilitarianism. According to utilitarianism, the right action is the action that leads to the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people.\nVirtue ethics is a theory that describes what is right or wrong in terms of an individual's character. According to this theory, an action is right if it is performed by someone with a good character, and an action is wrong if it is performed by someone with a bad character.\nVirtue ethics was first described by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. According to Aristotle, an individual with a virtuous character is someone who has the right aims and habits."}

A persuasive message can only be based on factual information if the audience knows what makes this product or service better than others.\nAnother important effect is to remind the audience about the product or service. A signal that a product is available can increase the audience's desire for it.\nAn effect of advertising is to make the audience feel like something is wrong. This feeling, called a problem, is the first step toward a persuasive message.\nA problem is a gap between what the audience has and what it wants. Advertising can remind the audience of a problem it has, or it can show the audience a new problem it may have.\nA solution is something that makes the audience's life better. A persuasive message can only solve a problem if the audience knows that the product or service will do what it claims.\nSOLUTION: Consumer exclusion is when the audience does not have enough information to decide whether to buy the product. This can happen when the information is not available or when the information is not understandable.\nConsumer vulnerability is when the audience has too much information, and the information is misleading.\nConsumer competence is when the audience has enough information to decide whether to buy the product.\nConsumer inclusion is when the audience has all the information they need to make an informed, reasoned decision about the product."}

Virtue ethicists believe that a fundamentally moral character is the most important good for a person. They believe that a person with a good character will make decisions that are in accordance with moral principles.\nEthical egoism locates morality in the sphere of self-interest. Ethical egoists believe that the best moral principle is that a person should act in his or her own self-interest.\nDeontological ethics locates morality in the sphere of duty. Deontological ethics assumes that there are duties and rights that are not dependent on what is in a person's self-interest.\nPostmodern ethics challenges the idea that there are any general moral principles that are valid for all people. Postmodern ethicists believe that claims of moral absolutes is an unfair imposition of the values of one group on another."}

It is often more suited to social media or texting than to academic writing. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.\nYou can tell whether language is formal or informal by considering its elevated or conversational tone. Formal language is usually more elevated, using grand or elevated language and avoiding overly simple or imprecise language. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal.\nInformal language is usually more conversational, using familiar or conversational language and implying a level of familiarity and intimacy. It tends to be less courteous and more friendly.\nSOLUTION: The question argues that society often prefers short-term benefits and quick fixes, and that these choices often have long-term costs. This is a consequentialist argument. Consequentialist reasoning considers the likely results of a decision.\nAn annual audit is a test of a company's financial statements. It is a test of the company's financial health. An annual audit can help a company avoid long-term financial problems. So, a consequentialist could argue that an annual audit is a long-term choice that can prevent long-term costs.\nA cost-benefit analysis is a way of comparing the costs of a decision with its benefits. So, a cost-benefit analysis is a consequentialist argument.\nA rationalization is a seemingly logical explanation that is actually an excuse. Rationalizations are often used to de-emphasize the ethical implications of a decision. So, a rationalized annual audit is an audit that is performed for reasons other than the long-term financial health of the company."}

The law has the force of command behind it, and is enforced by the authority. In a legal system, the rules of law are enforced by the government, and failure to follow them may result in penalties.\nEthics is a branch of philosophy that deals with what is right and wrong. It includes a study of the principles that define right and wrong behavior. Ethical rules do not have the force of law, but they do have the force of moral command.\nThe relationship between ethics and the law can be described as not close, but there is considerable overlap between the two. Some rules of law are also rules of ethics, such as those governing the protection of privacy. Other rules of law, such as those governing contracts, do not necessarily reflect fundamental ethical concerns.\nSOLUTION: The first answer choice, Incredibly close, in fact, in all instances what is ethical is also what is legal and vice versa., is incorrect.\nWhile there are rules of law that are also rules of ethics, the two do not completely overlap. For example, rules about harm to others are rules of ethics, but rules about contracts are not.\nThe second answer choice, Not close, ethics and the law share a small amount of overlap, but fundamentally address differing questions and themes., is incorrect.\nOverlap does not mean that ethics and the law are not different. Ethics and the law address different questions and themes. For example, the law may address how to deal with a harm, while ethics may address whether the harm is wrong.\nThe third answer choice, Close, as there is considerable overlap between ethics and law, but the two are not equivalent., is incorrect.\nWhile there is considerable overlap between ethics and law, the two are not equivalent. Ethics is a broader field that includes some questions that the law does not address.\nThe fourth answer choice, Not at all close, ethics and the law are virtually incompatible., is incorrect.\nEthics and the law are not incompatible.
