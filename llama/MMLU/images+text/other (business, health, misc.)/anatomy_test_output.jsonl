How does bone grow?\nBone growth begins in the bone's periosteum, the soft tissue that covers the bone. The periosteum is a strong, connective tissue with blood vessels and nerves that enter the bone.\nWhen a bone's periosteum gets thicker, it's called periosteal growth. Periosteal growth is how bones grow in length.\nWhen bone is removed from the center of a bone, it's called endochondral growth. This type of bone growth is how bones grow in width and height.\nThe bone's blood supply is important to its growth. New blood vessels carry blood to the bone's ossification centers, where bone growth begins.\nOssification centers appear early in fetal development. By the 12th week of fetal development, most bones have formed their ossification centers.\nSome bones, such as the jawbone, continue to grow after birth. How does the jawbone grow?\nThe jawbone grows by a type of endochondral growth. The jawbone grows in length because its ossification centers move closer together. This movement is called palatal shifting.\nAs the palatal shifting begins, the mental symphysis grows to close the gap. The mental symphysis is the connective tissue that connects the two bones of the jaw.\nSOLUTION: The ossification center appears about 8 weeks I.U.L medial to Meckel's cartilage.\nThe correct statement is about the appearance of the ossification center for the mandible. This statement is not affected by the growth of the mental symphysis or the ceasing of the condylar growth cartilage."}

To do this, you need to know the coordinates of three pairs of perpendicular lines.\nThe coordinates of a point are written with both a number line and a letter line. The number line shows the position of the point on the horizontal axis, and the letter line shows the position of the point on the vertical axis.\nHere are the directions for the coordinates:\nThe horizontal axis is the line at the bottom of the coordinate map. It shows the positions of points north and south.\nMiles north is shown by a positive number. Miles south is shown by a negative number.\nThe vertical axis is the line on the left side of the coordinate map.

Miles west is shown by a negative number.\nSOLUTION: To find the coordinates of a point, follow these steps:\n1. Determine the coordinates of the point due to north, the east, and the south.\nThe point is due north of the origin (0, 0). So, the north coordinate is 3.\nThe point is due east of the origin. So, the east coordinate is unknown.\nThe point is due south of the origin. So, the south coordinate is 5.\nThere are two choices for the east coordinate.

This technique is used to assess areas of swelling, pain, or tenderness.\nWhenever you are practicing structure palpation, remember to palpate the area in a systematic and symmetrical pattern. This will help you avoid missing a problem or interpreting a signal as coming from a different structure.\nFor example, if you palpate the front of the neck and find a tender area, you should also palpate the back of the neck. This is because structure palpation is most accurate when the entire area is examined.\nSOLUTION: The mental foramen is a bony structure that may be palpated in a live patient. The supraorbital foramen and the infraorbital foramen are not bony structures. They are openings on the surface of the skin."}

The dorsal horn is in the spinal cord and is the first place in the CNS where nociceptive signals are processed. The medial lemniscus is a pathway in the brainstem that carries nociceptive signals to the thalamus.\nThe thalamus is an important relay station for sensory information.

If a nerve is damaged, the signals that the nerve carries can be interrupted. The severity of the injury can determine the distance from the damaged nerve that symptoms are felt.\nNerve damage can cause a loss of feeling or movement in a part of the body. The loss of movement is called a muscle weakness. The loss of feeling is called a numbness.\nMuscle weakness and numbness can be mild or severe. Muscle weakness can cause a loss of strength. Numbness can cause a loss of sensation.\nSome nerves control muscles in more than one part of the body. If a nerve is damaged, muscle weakness or numbness can occur in more than one place.\nThe peripheral nerves are the nerves that go from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. The peripheral nerves can be damaged in many ways. Some common ways that peripheral nerves are damaged are:\nA cut or laceration.\nA crush injury.\nA burn.\nA stretch injury.\nA nerve can be partially damaged or completely damaged. A partially damaged nerve may recover on its own. A completely damaged nerve cannot recover.\nSOLUTION: A cut peripheral nerve can be repaired by the body. But the nerve may not regenerate if the damage is severe. If the nerve does not regenerate, the muscles it normally innervates will show signs of spastic paralysis or flaccid paralysis.\nSpastic paralysis and flaccid paralysis are forms of muscle weakness.\nSpastic paralysis is a muscle weakness that is often followed by a spasm. Spastic paralysis can cause muscles to feel stiff.\nFlaccid paralysis is a muscle weakness that is often followed by a period of no movement. Flaccid paralysis can cause muscles to feel weak.\nAtrophy and contracture are not related to nerve damage.\nAtrophy is a condition in which muscles are wasting away. Atrophy can be caused by a lack of use or by an injury.\nA contracture is a permanent shortening of a muscle. A contracture can be caused by a short muscle or by a muscle that has become too tight."}

This is because wings help organisms escape from predators.\nSOLUTION: Palatine shelf elevation is due to the effect of hydrophilic molecules increasing turgor pressure in the palatine shelves.\nHydrophilic molecules are water-loving. When a human drinks water, hydrophilic molecules in the water attract water to the human's body. This attraction makes the human's body tissues increase in size. The palatine shelves are tissues in the human's mouth. When the palatine shelves increase in size, they elevate. This elevation is due to the effect of hydrophilic molecules.\nDescent of the tongue, changes in flexure of the developing brain, and a combination of these three processes are not the correct answers."}

The tongue also helps move food to the throat and esophagus.\nThe tongue is made up of different parts. The tip of the tongue is called the tongue tip. The middle of the tongue is called the tongue blade. The back of the tongue is called the tongue base.\nEach part of the tongue is innervated by a different branch of the hypoglossal nerve.\nSOLUTION: Loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue indicates damage to the lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve.\nThe lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve goes to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This branch allows you to sense touch on the front of your tongue."}
