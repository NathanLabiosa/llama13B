It also set up the system of electors that is still in place today.\nThe electors are directed to vote for a president and vice president. If a presidential candidate receives a majority of the total electoral votes (at least 270 of 538), that candidate has won the presidency.\nSOLUTION: The question asks about approval, not voting. In presidential elections, Americans don't vote directly for the president. Instead, they vote for electors who, in turn, vote for the president.\nIn 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to an unprecedented third term in office. When he was elected in 1940, how many Americans approved of running a third time?\nThe question doesn't provide evidence of how 60% of Americans approved of running a third time."}

Economic output is the value of all the goods and services a country produces. A country's GDP is a very large number.\nA country's investments in renewable energy are a fraction of its GDP.

The list of hindrances included artificial political boundaries that covered diverse ethnic groups with little in common, inadequate access to higher education and training for nationals under the colonial administration, and control of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups which had been brought in by the colonial power.\nSOLUTION: Look at the choice of hindrances.\nCountries that were artificially created by the colonial powers often had borders that did not take into account the ethnic, linguistic, or religious differences of the peoples within them. For example, the country of Niger was created by the French, who separated the major ethnic groups of the Tuareg and the Peul. The Tuareg lived in the north, the Peul in the south. To the north, the Tuareg have been living in a self-governing region. To the south, the Peul have been living in a self-governing region. The countries of Sudan and Ethiopia were also artificially created.\nIn the years after World War II, many countries had inadequate access to higher education and training for their people. For example, in 1960, only about 5.5 percent of Egyptians had college degrees.\nIn some countries, minority groups brought in by the colonial powers dominated domestic commerce.
