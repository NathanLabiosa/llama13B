The blood becomes more acidic, and the muscles become more alkaline. This shift is caused by the conversion of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide. The kidneys are unable to compensate for the increase in acid in the blood. As a result, the body slows the exercise process. SOLUTION: Sodium bicarbonate ingestion can improve middle distance running performance. When sodium bicarbonate is ingested, the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid are increased. This allows a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. The muscles are able to replace acid more quickly. As a result, the body can remove more acid from the blood. The blood's acid-base balance is restored more quickly. The muscles can now contract more quickly. As a result, the body's exercise performance is improved."}

Glycogen breakdown is activated by several different factors.\nThe signaling pathways that tell the muscle to break down glycogen during exercise are activated by several hormones and metabolites. One of the key hormones involved is cortisol. Cortisol is produced by the adrenal gland in response to stress. Cortisol levels in the blood increase during exercise.\nAnother hormone involved is epinephrine. Epinephrine is produced by the adrenal gland as well. Its release is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. Epinephrine helps to raise the concentration of cortisol in the blood.\nA third hormone involved is insulin. Insulin is produced by the pancreas. It signals muscle and liver cells to take in glucose. During exercise, insulin levels in the blood increase. This increase helps to make sure that the muscle and liver are able to take in enough glucose to meet the body's energy demands.\nIn addition to hormones, the breakdown of glycogen is also affected by metabolites. One metabolite that helps to activate glycogen breakdown is pyruvate. Pyruvate is produced when the body breaks down glucose. Pyruvate levels in the blood increase during exercise.\nThe pH of muscle also affects glycogen breakdown. Glycogen breakdown is activated when the pH of muscle gets higher. This happens because of the release of lactic acid. Lactic acid is produced when the body breaks down glucose. The release of lactic acid lowers the pH of muscle. This decrease in pH activates glycogen breakdown."}

Lactate can be used by other muscles or organs or converted back to glucose.\nThe production of lactate in muscles is often referred to as muscle lactate production.\nDuring exercise, glycolysis is activated. Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose. When glucose is broken down, it forms two chemicals: pyruvate and lactate.\nThe release of lactate from muscles is responsible for the acidity of muscle. The pH of the muscle falls. The pH of an area is a measure of the acidity or basicity of the substances in that area. A lower pH indicates a more acidic environment.\nWhen oxygen is present, the release of lactate from muscles is slowed. This is because oxygen is needed to convert lactate back into glucose."}

The blocked or ruptured artery prevents blood from reaching part of the brain. This lack of blood flow causes cell death in the affected area.\nA subcortical stroke occurs when an artery in the subcortical area is blocked or ruptures. The blocked or ruptured artery prevents blood from reaching part of the brain. This lack of blood flow causes cell death in the affected area.\nThe suboccipital area is located below the occiput. It contains part of the brainstem, including the inferior cerebellar peduncles and the superior medial thalamic radiation.\nA suboccipital stroke occurs when an artery in the suboccipital area is blocked or ruptures. The blocked or ruptured artery prevents blood from reaching part of the brain. This lack of blood flow causes cell death in the affected area.\nThe temporal pole is the part of the brain located at the junction of the temporal and parietal lobes. It is involved in attention and memory.\nA temporal pole stroke occurs when an artery in the temporal pole is blocked or ruptures. The blocked or ruptured artery prevents blood from reaching part of the brain. This lack of blood flow causes cell death in the affected area.\nThe trapezius is a muscle in the back. A trapezius squeeze is a central painful stimulus. It is not actually squeezing the muscle. Instead, it is stimulating the muscle.\nThe sternal area is the chest. A sternal rub is a central painful stimulus. It is not actually rubbing the bone. Instead, it is stimulating the chest."}

An enzyme acts as a catalyst to lower the activation energy for a reaction. Muscle glycogen is broken down to glucose-1-phosphate, which is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate.\nThe glucose-6-phosphate can then be used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), or it can be converted into other forms of glucose. The other forms of glucose can be used by the muscles for energy or stored as glycogen.\nThe breakdown of muscle glycogen also produces lactic acid. Lactic acid can build up in the muscles and cause pain. But this pain is not caused by glycogen running out. Instead, the pain is caused by the lactic acid.\nElite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles. Type I fibres are also known as slow-twitch fibres. They have more mitochondria than fast-twitch fibres. Mitochondria help break down glucose to release energy, so Type I fibres can use glucose more efficiently than fast-twitch fibres.\nLiver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration. The liver is the only organ that can make glucose. It makes glucose from noncarbohydrate sources, such as amino acids. When the blood glucose concentration is low, the liver can release glucose into the blood.\nInsulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body. When the levels of glucose in the blood rise, insulin is released. Insulin helps cells in the liver and muscles take up glucose from the blood. Released glucose is used for energy or is stored as glycogen."}

If these organic phosphates are not removed from the muscles, they can build up and impair muscle contraction.\nAn accumulation of inorganic phosphate is thought to be implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities.\nDuring multiple sprint activities, the concentration of inorganic phosphate in the muscles increases. This increase in inorganic phosphate is thought to impair muscle contraction by affecting the muscle's calcium ions.\nTo maintain proper muscle function, the concentration of calcium ions in the muscles must be meticulously regulated. An accumulation of inorganic phosphate can make it difficult for the muscles to maintain this careful calcium ion balance."}

Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nAn allele that is not the dominant allele is referred to as recessive. If both alleles in an organism's genotype are recessive, the organism's phenotype must be recessive.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype only when the organism is homozygous for that allele.

An intracellular buffer is a molecule that can react with H+ or HCO3-, the ions that affect pH.\nWhen the pH of an aqueous solution changes, the concentration of H+ or HCO3- ions changes. These ion concentrations change because H+ and HCO3- are present in the solution and react with water to form water and the ion. For example, when the pH of a solution is low, H+ ions are present in higher concentration than HCO3- ions. So, the reaction H2O + H+ \u21cc H3O+ + H2O and H2O + HCO3- \u21cc HCO3- + H2O can help bring the pH of the solution back up to normal. These reactions are examples of self-ionization.\nThe reaction rates for these self-ionization reactions are affected by the concentrations of the ions. As the concentration of the ion changes, the reaction rate changes. An intracellular buffer can react with H+ or HCO3- ions to prevent or limit changes in the ion concentrations.\nSOLUTION: Glutamine, Carnosine, and Amylase are not involved in regulating pH.\nGlucose acts as an intracellular buffer to regulate its own pH. When the rate of glycolysis is high, the concentration of glucose-6-phosphate ions increases. These ions can react with water to form glucose and 6-phosphate. This reaction is a self-ionization reaction that can help regulate the pH of the cell."}

When your muscles are active, they need to release energy to fuel their activities. Creatine kinase helps to release energy from creatine phosphate.\nCreatine kinase reaction\nThe reaction is irreversible. Once creatine and a phosphate group are joined, they cannot be separated.\nThe reaction releases energy that can be used by the muscles.\nThe reaction is slow compared with glycolysis. Glycolysis is a pathway that releases sugar from the blood. It releases energy that can be used by the muscles. Because glycolysis releases energy more quickly than creatine kinase, the muscles can use sugar instead of creatine phosphate for energy.\nCreatine kinase is not activated until all the ATP has been used up. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a molecule that releases energy. When your muscles need energy, they use ATP. Because creatine kinase is not activated until all the ATP has been used up, the muscles cannot release energy from creatine until they have used all their ATP.\nCreatine kinase is inhibited by low pH in the muscle. Creatine kinase is involved in a reaction that releases hydrogen ions (H+) into the muscle. The muscle's pH can affect how well creatine kinase can release these hydrogen ions. If the muscle's pH is too low, the reaction is inhibited."}

They can increase the rate of a reaction by several orders of magnitude.\nEnzymes are made up of subunits called amino acids. The specific arrangement of these amino acids determines the 3-D shape of the enzyme. This shape is important because it dictates the location of the enzyme's active site, the region of the enzyme to which the substrate binds.\nThe substrate binds to the enzyme at the active site. This binding causes a change in the enzyme's shape, which affects the position of the substrate's chemical bonds. These bonds are then aligned in such a way that the reaction can proceed.\nAfter the reaction occurs, the enzyme is released. The release of the enzyme is not permanent, however. The enzyme can then rebind to the substrate and catalyze another reaction.\nProsthetic groups are not part of the enzyme. Instead, they are loosely bound to the enzyme. Prosthetic groups can include co-factors, which are small molecules that help to catalyze the reaction. For example, copper is a co-factor for the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. This enzyme uses copper to help force oxygen into the breakdown of fatty acids."}

Your muscles can get energy faster by breaking down a compound called phosphocreatine. After exercise, your muscles can resynthesize phosphocreatine.\nThe rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis is affected by the availability of oxygen. When oxygen is limited, phosphocreatine resynthesis is slowed. So, muscles must use more slowly available energy before they can use faster energy.\nWhen your body has an excess of oxygen, it can use up phosphocreatine more slowly. This can make phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise slower.\nAn excess of creatine, on the other hand, does not affect phosphocreatine resynthesis.\nHyperventilation, or breathing more heavily than normal, can make the blood more acidic. This can speed up phosphocreatine resynthesis.\nA lack of oxygen does not affect phosphocreatine resynthesis."}

The blood is made up of blood cells and a liquid called plasma.\nThe blood cells are made in the bone marrow and circulate in the blood. The plasma is made up of water and salt. The plasma helps to transport water and salt to and from the cells.\nThe blood vessels are organs that carry blood. They have walls that can stretch to hold the blood. The blood vessels have special layers that regulate the flow of blood. They can cause the blood to flow more quickly in one part of the body than in another.\nThe kidneys are organs that filter the blood. They remove excess water and waste products from the blood. The blood transporter in the kidneys is called the glomerulus.\nThe liver is an organ that produces chemicals that help the blood. The liver makes sure that the blood has enough glucose. It also makes sure that the blood has the right amount of oxygen. The liver helps the blood to clot.\nSOLUTION: Oedema is the presence of excessive fluid in the interstitial space. The interstitial space is the space between the cells.\nExcessive intravascular fluid is present when there is too much fluid in the blood vessels. This type of oedema is called venous oedema. It can be caused by standing for long periods.\nExcessive extravascular fluid is present when there is too much fluid in the interstitial space. This type of oedema is called interstitial oedema. It can be caused by an allergic reaction.\nExcessive intracranial fluid is present when there is too much fluid in the skull. This type of oedema is called cranial oedema. It can be caused by a head injury.\nExcessive necrotic cells are dead cells. Necrotic cells do not have water. So, the presence of excessive necrotic cells does not cause oedema."}
