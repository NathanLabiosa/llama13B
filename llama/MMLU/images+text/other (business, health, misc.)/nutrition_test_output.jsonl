The food then moves into the stomach, where it is mixed with stomach acid. The stomach acid breaks down the food into small particles of fat, protein, and carbohydrates.\nAbsorption of fat in the small intestine begins in the duodenum, where bile from the liver mixes with the fat. Bile salts help emulsify, or break down, the fat into smaller droplets. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice, which contains enzymes called lipases. The lipases break down the fat into free fatty acids and glycerol. The free fatty acids and glycerol are then absorbed through the intestinal walls."}

The number refers to the amount of the substance, and the unit comes after the number. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nFor example, the number 120 is the amount of the substance, and the unit is mg. So, 120 mg means the same thing as 120 milligrams.\nWhen you are using metric units, the unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nFor example, the number 2.3 is the amount of the substance, and the unit is mg. So, 2.3 mg means the same thing as 2.3 milligrams.\nWhen you are using customary units, the unit comes before the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nFor example, the number 120 is the amount of the substance, and the unit is mg. So, 120 mg means the same thing as 120 milligrams.\nThe iron status of a person can be affected by several factors, including dietary intake, food sources of iron, and the person's ability to absorb and store iron.\nDifferent laboratory methods can be used to measure various aspects of iron status. For example, blood tests can be used to measure blood levels of iron and iron-binding proteins, such as transferrin and ferritin.\nSOLUTION: Each of the four specific iron indices can be measured accurately and easily.\nBecause blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc., blood haemoglobin levels are not necessarily a reliable index of iron status."}

Because they are chemically identical to other isotopes of the element, stable isotopes do not change the behavior of substances that contain them. Isotopes are denoted by the element name followed by a subscript number. For example, carbon has two stable isotopes: carbon 12 and carbon 13.\nThe ratio of a stable isotope to its most abundant isotope in a substance is called the isotopic ratio. This ratio can be used to determine the source of a substance. For example, the isotopic ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 in carbon dioxide can be used to determine whether carbon dioxide is the product of animal or plant metabolism. Animals and plants have different isotopic ratios of carbon 12 to carbon 13 in their carbon dioxide.\nSOLUTION: Carbon 13 is the stable isotope commonly given for the measurement of total body water."}

But how do scientists decide what to investigate? How do they decide what is a relevant mechanism?\nOne way scientists decide what to investigate is by looking at past research. Scientists often build on each other's work.\nAnother way scientists decide what to investigate is by considering the evidence. Evidence is the information that scientists have gathered during past research. Scientists use evidence to make observations and draw conclusions.\nA mechanism is a set of steps that lead to a particular outcome. In the case of cholesterol, mechanisms may include how cholesterol is absorbed by the body, how it is transported to cells, and how it is cleared from the body.\nSOLUTION: Intestinally derived lipoproteins are transported to the liver by the portal vein. The liver processes these lipoproteins and can remove them from the blood by a process called reuptake.\nThe liver can remove an equal or greater number of lipoproteins from the blood than it releases. So, the level of cholesterol in the blood depends on the balance of cholesterol in the lipoproteins that enter the liver and the lipoproteins that are reuptaken.\nThe liver has multiple intrahepatic responses to increased cellular cholesterol. This means that the liver can use different mechanisms to handle cholesterol when there is a lot of cholesterol in the blood.\nThe mechanisms regulating the absorption of cholesterol and its export in lipoproteins are complex. So, the evidence to support the relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels in humans is inconclusive."}

Part of this response involves production of certain proteins, such as acute phase proteins. These proteins are synthesized in response to an infection or injury and are released into the blood.\nSerum amyloid A is an acute phase protein that is synthesized in the liver in response to an infection or inflammation. It is released into the blood and can be measured with a laboratory assay. The level of serum amyloid A in the blood increases during an acute phase response.\nSome biochemical indices of micronutrient status, such as serum or plasma measurements of micronutrient levels, may give misleading results in people with infections or inflammatory states. This is because an acute phase reaction can change the tissue distribution of certain micronutrients. For example, an acute phase reaction can cause a sick person to have more iron in their liver and less iron in their plasma.\nSOLUTION: An acute phase reaction can change the tissue distribution of certain micronutrients. This can make it difficult to interpret biochemical indices of micronutrient status. For example, a sick person may have a low level of micronutrient A in their plasma, but a normal level of micronutrient A in their tissues."}

These studies can be useful in identifying factors that are associated with an increased risk of a disease. But, there are also limitations to this type of research.\nOne of the main limitations is that observed associations may not be caused by the factor being studied. For example, if a study finds that people who eat more grilled chicken have a higher risk of cancer, it does not mean that grilled chicken causes cancer. Other factors not examined in the study may be responsible for the observed association.\nAnother limitation is that human exposure to a contaminant or other factor through food is usually much less than exposures that have been studied. This is because people eat food from many different sources, and they do not eat every meal from the same source. Studies that expose animals to a contaminant or other factor in their food usually show higher exposures than what would be expected in human diets.\nControlled animal studies can be useful in predicting the potential health effects of a contaminant in food. In a controlled animal study, one group of animals is fed food containing a contaminant, and another group is not. The animals in the fed group may show health effects that are similar to those observed in humans. But, animal studies cannot predict with certainty what the health effects in humans will be.\nReliable dose-response data are difficult to acquire and often unavailable. A dose-response study is a study that examines the relationship between how much of a contaminant people are exposed to and the severity of the health effects. To conclude that a contaminant is associated with a health effect, dose-response data are usually required. These data can be difficult to acquire because it is usually not possible to expose people to a contaminant in food in a controlled experiment.\nSOLUTION: Observational epidemiology studies have produced useful information about the health effects of many food contaminants. But, it is never possible to know whether observed effects are caused by the contaminant. Other factors not examined in the study may be responsible for the observed association."}

The thermic effect of food increases after a day of over-nutrition and decreases after a day of under-nutrition.\nAdaptive thermogenesis is an organism's ability to adjust its metabolic rate in response to changes in body weight. When you gain or lose weight, your metabolic rate changes so that your body can maintain a constant body weight.\nBasal metabolic rate is the amount of energy your body uses to maintain vital functions when you are at rest. Your basal metabolic rate decreases as you age because your body slows down.\nThe thermal balance theory suggests that an organism's metabolic rate adjusts to the food availability in its environment.

{"question": "Of the classes of dietary fatty acids which have the most beneficial effect on plasma LDL cholesterol levels?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Saturated and trans unsaturated fatty acids"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Monounsaturated fatty acids"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both a and c"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Dietary fatty acids are the building blocks of triglycerides, which are the main storage form of fat in the body. Fatty acids also have other important functions, such as serving as building blocks for cell membranes and as precursors for hormones and other signaling molecules.\nFatty acids are made up of chains of atoms: the carbon atoms are linked by single or double bonds to hydrogen and other atoms. The number of carbon atoms in a fatty acid chain determines its chemical properties. Fatty acids with fewer than 14 carbon atoms are called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Fatty acids with 14 to 20 carbon atoms are called medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Fatty acids with more than 20 carbon atoms are called long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs).\nFatty acids are also classified by their degree of unsaturation. A fatty acid is unsaturated if it has one or more double bonds between its carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids can be further classified as monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.\nThe double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids can be in different places in the carbon chain. These places determine the type of unsaturated fatty acid.\nFor example, if the double bond is between the second and third carbon atoms, the fatty acid is called an oleic acid. If the double bond is between the third and fourth carbon atoms, the fatty acid is called a linoleic acid.\nAll fatty acids are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Unsaturated fatty acids also contain some other atoms. The number of atoms in an unsaturated fatty acid is shown in its chemical formula. The chemical formula for a fatty acid contains the symbol for each atom in the fatty acid.\nFor example, the chemical formula for oleic acid is C17:1 W7. The symbol C17 means that the molecule contains 17 carbon atoms. The symbol W7 means that the molecule contains one double bond, and the double bond is between the first and second carbon atoms.\nSOLUTION: To predict which types of dietary fatty acids have the most beneficial effect on plasma LDL cholesterol levels, you need to know how each type affects LDL cholesterol levels.\nThe effect of dietary fatty acids on LDL cholesterol levels depends on the type of fatty acid.\nSOLUTION: Both n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids are known to have a beneficial effect on plasma LDL cholesterol levels.\nSOLUTION: Saturated and trans unsaturated fatty acids are not polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids are typically solid at room temperature. They can increase LDL cholesterol levels.\nMonounsaturated fatty acids are not polyunsaturated fatty acids.

This approach includes investigating each of the following components:\nExposures: The causes of most health outcomes are exposures. An exposure is something in the environment that a person is exposed to. Some exposures are obvious, such as smoking or drinking water from a contaminated stream. Other exposures are less obvious, such as living near a hazardous waste site.\nDisease outcomes: Disease outcomes are the health problems that the epidemiologists are investigating. These outcomes can be cancer, a birth defect, or a neurological disorder.\nPopulations: Populations are the groups of people that are being investigated. Populations can be people who live in a particular place, people who eat a certain type of food, or people who have a particular occupation.\nTime: Time is an important part of an epidemiologic investigation. Epidemiologists look at the timing of an exposure and the timing of a disease outcome. They also look at how long people were exposed to an exposure before they developed a disease.\nOption: A. The estimated strength of the association between an exposure and the outcome.\nAn association is a relationship between two things that may be caused by exposure. A association can be strong or weak. Epidemiologists use different terms to describe the strength of an association:\nPositive association: The exposure and outcome are both greater than average.\nNegative association: The exposure and outcome are both less than average.\nZero association: The exposure and outcome are both average.\nAssociations can be measured as numbers. The numbers can show how much the exposure or outcome varies. For example, if the number is 1, then the exposure and outcome are both average. If the number is 2, then the exposure and outcome vary a lot.\nOption: B. Evidence that the exposure of interest has appeared before the outcome.\nThis option describes the first known association between an exposure and an outcome. This type of evidence is important because it suggests that the exposure may be causing the outcome.\nOption: C.

The blood carries these nutrients to cells throughout the body. Cells use these nutrients for energy, growth, and maintenance.\nGlucose is a type of carbohydrate. Glucose is absorbed into the blood from the small intestine.\nThe blood delivers glucose to cells throughout the body. Cells can use glucose for energy, or they can convert it to stored energy, in the form of glycogen.\nGlycemic index is a measure of how quickly blood glucose levels rise after eating a particular type of food. Foods with a high glycemic index raise blood glucose levels quickly. Foods with a low glycemic index raise blood glucose levels slowly.\nProtein is a type of nutrient. The body uses protein to grow and repair cells.\nThe body breaks down protein from food into building blocks called amino acids. The body can use these amino acids to make new proteins. The body has 20 different amino acids. Nine of them are essential. Essential amino acids are not made by the body. The body must get them from food.\nCarbohydrate and protein are two important nutrients. A healthy diet should have a balance of carbohydrate and protein. How much carbohydrate and protein a person needs depends on their age, size, and level of physical activity.\nSOLUTION: High protein and high glycemic index is not a recommended type of diet for weight maintenance.\nEating a lot of high protein foods can be hard on the kidneys. The kidneys remove waste from the blood. When the body has too much protein, the kidneies have to work harder.

VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein.\nAs VLDL moves through the bloodstream, it can give up some of its lipids to other particles. For example, VLDL can give lipids to chylomicrons or to HDL. When VLDL lipids are removed, the VLDL particles become smaller and more dense. These smaller particles are now called IDL, or intermediate-density lipoproteins.\nAs IDL moves through the bloodstream, it can give up some of its lipids to LDL. When IDL lipids are removed, the IDL particles become LDL particles. LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein.\nAn LDL particle is made up of proteins and lipids.

Hormones can affect cellular activity, often by binding to receptors on the surface of cells.\nThe hypothalamus is a small region at the base of the brain that contains many cells that produce hormones. Most of the hypothalamus's hormones are released into the bloodstream in response to signals from other parts of the body.\nThe hypothalamus has two main roles. It helps control bodily functions such as heart rate, thirst, and hunger. It also helps regulate the body's temperature.\nThe hypothalamus uses feedback loops to maintain homeostasis. A feedback loop is a process that uses a signal from a system to control the system.\nFor example, hunger is controlled by a feedback loop. Hunger stimulates the hypothalamus to release a hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin stimulates the stomach to release food from the stomach into the small intestine. After the food has been absorbed, a hormone called insulin is released into the bloodstream. Insulin stimulates the cells to use sugar. The cells' sugar use sends a signal back to the hypothalamus to stop the release of ghrelin. As a result, the body feels full and hungry no longer.\nSOLUTION: The hypothalamus has two hormones that act on the hypothalamus to increase satiety and hunger, respectively. These hormones are leptin and ghrelin.\nLeptin increases satiety. When the hypothalamus detects that the body has enough energy, it stops sending signals to eat. Leptin is produced by the body's fat cells.\nGhrelin increases hunger. When the hypothalamus detects that the body needs energy, it sends signals to eat. Ghrelin is produced by the stomach."}

It has different levels and aspects. In the agricultural and food sector, globalisation refers to the increasing integration of food systems across the world.\nThere are many aspects to globalisation and food security. One aspect is that food security is not one of the issues dealt with in the rules of the World Trade Organisation. So, there are no rules on how countries should act to ensure that food is available to all.\nAnother aspect is that wealthy countries' subsidies and trade barriers make it difficult for developing countries to sell their agricultural products. This means that developing countries cannot use agriculture to increase their food security.\nSupermarkets have also played a role in globalisation and food security. Supermarkets can use their buying power to get food at lower prices. But because they often buy from the cheapest suppliers, they can also put local food producers out of business.\nFinally, developing countries need to create publicly-owned food reserves in order to realise the potential benefits.

When incomes rise, people can buy more food if they want to. But most people do not need to eat a larger percentage of their income. So, the proportion of income spent on food goes down."}

Substrate fuel interconversion occurs during intense exercise. The muscle can use either plasma free fatty acids or muscle triacylglycerol as fuel. An advantage of using muscle triacylglycerol as fuel is that it does not require the constant uptake of free fatty acids from the plasma.\nWhen a meal containing animal fats and sugars is consumed, the plasma triacylglycerols increase. Most of these triacylglycerols are in very large VLDL particles. As the liver processes these VLDL particles, they are converted into IDL particles, which are then converted into LDL particles. These LDL particles are released from the liver and make up about 50% of the cholesterol in the plasma LDL particles.\nThe muscle can use triacylglycerols from both VLDL and LDL. However, the muscle can use triacylglycerols in VLDL as fuel more efficiently than triacylglycerols in LDL. This is because VLDL triacylglycerols are in smaller particles and are more easily taken up by the muscle.\nDuring intense exercise, the muscle can use either plasma free fatty acids or muscle triacylglycerols as fuel. The muscle uses more fat than carbohydrate as a fuel during long-term intense exercise, such as marathon running."}

They have two special features: nonrivalry and nonsolution. Nonrivalry means that one person's use of the good does not prevent others from using it. Nonsolution means that it is difficult to charge people for using the good.\nAgricultural research is a public good. Many people benefit from new types of seeds, fungicides, and other research findings. These benefits are nonrivalrous: one person's use of the new knowledge does not prevent others from using it. And the benefits are difficult to charge for, because the new knowledge is often available without charge.\nTransnational private-sector firms are not the main source of research oriented towards poor farmers and consumers. Such firms mainly conduct research that is oriented towards consumers in developed countries.\nResearch focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a public good with little profit potential but high social benefits. Public investment is needed to support it.\nPro-poor research should focus on organic farming. But organic farming is not the only way to help poor farmers. Agricultural research can help poor farmers by developing new technologies that are low cost and easy to use."}

The information in DNA is transferred to RNA, which is then used to synthesize proteins.\nThe first step in protein synthesis is transcription, the formation of RNA from the DNA template. Transcription involves the synthesis of an RNA molecule that is complementary to a strand of DNA. During transcription, the two strands of the DNA double helix are separated, and one strand serves as a template for the synthesis of RNA. The RNA molecule that is formed during transcription is called messenger RNA, or mRNA.\nAfter transcription, the mRNA molecule is modified and transported to the cytoplasm. The mRNA molecule is then translated, or read, by cells to synthesize a protein. Translation involves the synthesis of a protein molecule that is complementary to the mRNA molecule. During translation, the mRNA molecule binds to ribosomes, and the ribosomes use the information in the mRNA to synthesize a protein.\nThe second step in protein synthesis is called translation because the information in the mRNA is used to translate the genetic code into a protein.\nBoth strands of DNA are not transcribed to form mRNA.\nOnly one strand of DNA is transcribed to form mRNA. The strand of DNA that is not transcribed is called the non-coding strand.\nThe RNA formed by transcription of DNA undergoes splicing and further modifications to form mRNA.\nAfter transcription, the mRNA undergoes splicing and further modifications, such as the addition of a terminal end. These modifications are required for the mRNA to be translated.\nAll the information in DNA codes for proteins.\nAll of the information in DNA is used to synthesize proteins.\nThe mRNA formed by transcription of a region of DNA only contains information for the protein to be synthesized.\nThe mRNA molecule is formed by transcription and contains all of the information needed to synthesize a protein."}
