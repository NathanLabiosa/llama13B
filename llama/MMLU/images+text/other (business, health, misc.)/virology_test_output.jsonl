The immune system includes many types of cells, proteins, and other substances.\nThe immune system has two main parts: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.\nThe innate immune system is the part of the immune system that provides general defense against all invaders. The innate immune system includes cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, which attack and kill invaders in a non-specific way.\nThe adaptive immune system is the part of the immune system that provides specific defense against invaders. The adaptive immune system includes cells such as T cells and B cells, which can recognize and attack invaders as they develop in the body.\nThe special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells. Clonal expansion is the process by which a single cell, or a small number of cells, can make many copies of itself. This process is important in the adaptive immune system because it allows the immune system to produce many cells that can specifically recognize and attack an invader."}

Vaccines contain a small amount of a killed or weakened organism, or a part of an organism, that causes a disease. They can also contain a substance that resembles the organism.\nWhen a person is vaccinated, the body recognizes the substance as a foreign substance. The body responds by building antibodies to fight the substance. These antibodies remain in the body until they are needed to fight the disease.\nIf a person is later exposed to the disease, the body can use the antibodies to fight it. This helps prevent the person from getting the disease.\nThere are many types of vaccines. Some vaccines are made with live organisms that have been weakened. Others are made with killed organisms. Some vaccines contain a small amount of a substance that resembles a disease-causing organism.\nAn attenuated vaccine is a live vaccine that contains organisms that have been weakened. The organisms in an attenuated vaccine can still enter cells of the body. But the organisms cannot replicate, or make new organisms. This means that the vaccine cannot give the person the disease.\nA killed vaccine is a live vaccine that contains organisms that have been killed. A killed vaccine cannot give the person the disease.\nA subunit vaccine is a vaccine that contains a small part of an organism. A subunit vaccine cannot give the person the disease.\nSOLUTION: Polio is caused by a virus. A virus is a small infectious organism that is not a living cell.\nA killed polio vaccine contains inactivated poliovirus. The body recognizes the poliovirus in the killed vaccine and builds antibodies to fight it.\nA live polio vaccine contains live, weakened poliovirus. The body recognizes the poliovirus in the live vaccine and builds antibodies to fight it.\nA combination of the killed and live vaccines contains both inactivated and live poliovirus. The body recognizes the poliovirus in the combination vaccine and builds antibodies to fight it.\nAttention to sewage control and hygiene is important in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

When you design an experiment, you identify the parts of the experiment that vary, or are different. Then, you measure how those variables compare.\nFor example, imagine that you want to find out whether fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were the variables. The amount of fertilizer was different between the two groups. The number of tomatoes was measured for each group.\nExperiments have control groups. A control group is a group of plants, animals, or people that do not receive the experimental treatment. In other words, the control group does not get the fertilizer.\nBy comparing the control group to the group that receives the experimental treatment, you can conclude whether the experimental treatment has a significant effect. If the two groups have the same results, the experimental treatment does not have a significant effect.\nSOLUTION: The control group should not be exposed to the chemical waste. If the control group is not exposed to the chemical waste, then the experimental treatment (exposure to the chemical waste) can be compared to the control group.\nChildren not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL are not exposed to the chemical waste. So, they are a possible control group.\nChildren from the hospital\u2019s outpatient clinic who do not suffer from ALL are not exposed to the chemical waste. So, they are a possible control group.\nChildren exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL are exposed to the chemical waste. So, they are not a possible control group.\nChildren not exposed to the chemical waste who suffer from ALL are not exposed to the chemical waste. So, they are a possible control group."}

They do not have all of the parts that living organisms have.\nIn order to reproduce, a virus must get inside a cell. This is called infection. Most viruses enter cells by attaching to them.\nAfter a virus enters a cell, it can use the cell's machinery to make new virus particles. The cell is then able to release the virus particles.\nWhen a virus enters a human cell, it is not a disease. It is only when the virus particles are released from the cell that they can cause infection.\nThe type of disease a virus causes depends on the cells it invades. Different viruses cause different diseases.\nSOLUTION: Lassa and Ebola are viruses that originated in fruit bats.\nScientists have identified the virus that causes Lassa fever in fruit bats. Fruit bats are also called fruit trees.\nScientists have identified the virus that causes Ebola fever in fruit bats.\nThe virus does not live in fruit bats. Instead, the virus uses fruit bats as a host.\nA host is an animal that a virus uses to reproduce.\nThe virus reproduces inside the fruit bat. Then, the fruit bat releases the virus.\nOther animals can become infected with the virus if they eat the fruit bat.\nHumans are another host for Ebola virus. Humans can become infected with the virus by touching an infected fruit bat or by eating a fruit that is contaminated with the virus.\nPrimates, pigs, and fruit bats are not the origin of Lassa or Ebola viruses."}

In order to replicate, a virus must enter a cell and use the cell's machinery to make new virus parts.\nThe following are ways in which viruses can reproduce:\nAs positive strand RNA viruses: The virus enters a cell and uses the cell's machinery to transcribe and replicate its RNA. The cell's ribosomes then use the RNA to translate into protein. The new protein helps the virus make more RNA and replicate itself.\nAs negative strand RNA viruses: The virus enters a cell and uses the cell's machinery to transcribe its RNA into DNA. The DNA form of the RNA is then transcribed back into RNA. The cell's ribosomes then use the RNA to translate into protein. The new protein helps the virus make more RNA and replicate itself.\nRetroviruses: Retroviruses are a type of virus that replicates by using genetic reassortment. The virus enters a cell and transcribes its RNA into DNA. The cell's machinery then transcribes the DNA into RNA. The RNA is then reverse transcribed into DNA. The cell's machinery then transcribes the DNA into RNA. The RNA is then reverse transcribed into DNA. The cell's machinery then transcribes the DNA into RNA. The virus uses the RNA to translate into protein. The new protein helps the virus make more RNA and replicate itself.\nUsing genetic reassortment: Genetic reassortment occurs when two or more viruses combine their genes to make a new virus. This process can happen naturally when two different viruses infect a cell. Or, it can happen in the laboratory.\nSOLUTION: The calcivirus family is a family of positive strand RNA viruses. As positive strand RNA viruses, calciviruses enter a cell and use the cell's machinery to replicate their RNA."}

A mutation is a change in the virus's genes. Mutations can help the virus become resistant to drugs.\nWhen drugs are used to treat a virus, the virus can change its genes in response. Then, the virus may no longer be killed by the drug.\nSOLUTION: Drug combinations are essential for HIV for several reasons:\nSingle drugs are not completely inhibitory. Some viruses may not be killed by a single drug. Combinations of drugs can make sure that the virus is completely inhibited.\nMutations can negate the effect of one drug. If a virus mutates, it may no longer be killed by one drug. Combinations of drugs can kill the virus even if it has mutated.\nCombinations of antibiotics are effective versus TB. TB is caused by a bacterium. Like other bacteria, TB can become resistant to drugs. Combinations of drugs may be given to ensure that the bacteria are completely killed.\nThe virus cannot mutate vs a combination. Since HIV is a virus, it can mutate. But even if the virus does mutate, combinations of drugs may still be effective."}

They rely on the cells they invade to provide the necessary materials and energy for their own reproduction.\nViruses use cellular proteins and lipids to create their own proteins and nucleic acids. Because viruses do not have all of the cellular structures required for independent survival, they cannot be grown in the laboratory without host cells.\nVirus reproduction is controlled by the interactions between viral and cellular molecules. These interactions determine the type of infection, or the viral replication process.\nViruses reproduce in one of two ways: by the nucleic acid replication method or the virus-induced cell membrane fusion method.\nAfter the virus enters the host cell, the viral nucleic acid is replicated. The cell uses the viral nucleic acid to create new viral proteins and nucleic acids.\nAfter the new viral proteins and nucleic acids are created, the viruses are released from the host cell. The release of viruses from host cells is called virus-induced cell membrane fusion.\nThe host cell is then free to respond to the infection. The host cell may respond in one of two ways: by the inflammatory response or the humoral response.\nThe inflammatory response is caused by the direct effects of viral infection. In response to the infection, nearby cells come together to form a vacuole containing the invading virus. This vacuole helps to stop the virus from spreading.\nThe humoral response is caused by the indirect effects of viral infection. In response to the infection, the host cell produces substances that help to stop the virus. These substances are called antibodies.\nSOLUTION: The bunyavirus family predominantly affects birds, but some members can be spread to humans.\nThe bunyavirus family does not have the ability to cause long-term infections in their midge, mosquito, sandfly, or tick vectors.\nBunyaviruses do not have the ability to amplify by persistent infection of midgets, mosquitoes, sand flies, or ticks.\nBunyaviruses have the ability to spread to humans via bites of infected mice and rats.\nBunyaviruses have the ability to undergo genetic recombination or reassortment."}

The Report is a result of the National Commission's work and is named after the community in which the Commission's staff lived and worked. The Belmont Report is named after the Belmont Conference, which was held in 1975 in the community of Belmont, Massachusetts.\nThe Belmont Report describes the basic ethical principles that should guide the research with human subjects. These principles include:\nRespect for persons: This principle requires that research subjects be treated as autonomous individuals who are capable of making their own decisions. The principle also requires that research subjects be informed about the research and its potential risks and benefits.\nBeneficence: This principle requires that the research not do harm to the subjects and that the research have potential benefits for the subjects and others.\nJustice: This principle requires that the selection of research subjects be fair and that the benefits and burdens of the research be distributed fairly.\nThe Declaration of Helsinki is a set of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. The Declaration is a statement of ethical principles, not a regulatory instrument. It is expected that research be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration.\nThe Declaration of Helsinki is grounded in the belief that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

Viruses enter cells by fusing their membranes to the host cell's membranes. They can enter cells by different strategies.\nSome viruses enter cells by puncturing the host cell's membranes. The paramyxovirus family is one of these viruses. The virus uses its membrane-bound viral protein to puncture the host cell's membranes. The virus and host cell then fuse, and the virus releases its genetic material into the host cell.\nOther viruses use a strategy called fusion from within a cytoplasmic vacuole. The measles virus enters cells by fusion from within a cytoplasmic vacuole at low pH. The virus enters the cell by first infecting a vacuole in the cytoplasm. The vacuole's pH is low. The virus waits in the vacuole until the host cell's membranes come close to the vacuole. The low pH causes the viral and host cell membranes to fuse. The virus releases its genetic material into the host cell.\nThe fusion strategy used by the paramyxovirus family is known as fusion from without. The virus forms membranous spikes, called triskelions, which project from the viral membrane. The triskelions puncture the host cell's membranes. The virus and host cell then fuse, and the virus releases its genetic material into the host cell.\nSome viruses use a strategy called fusion mediated by M protein. The M protein is a membrane protein found in the virion (the virus particle). It is involved in cell entry. The M protein interacts with the host cell's membranes. This interaction causes the viral and host cell membranes to fuse. The virus releases its genetic material into the host cell."}

Vaccines work by exposing your body to a small, dead piece of a virus or bacteria. This exposure trains your body to recognize the disease so that it can fight it off if you are ever exposed to the virus or bacteria again.\nThere are many different vaccines. Some vaccines are given to prevent diseases that are spread from person to person. Other vaccines are given to prevent diseases that are caused by bites from insects or animals.\nStill, other vaccines are given to prevent diseases that you can get while you are traveling. Before you travel, you may want to look up what vaccines are recommended for the places you will visit.\nSOLUTION: The yellow fever vaccine is the most successful and most widely used travel vaccine. The yellow fever vaccine is recommended for international travelers who are going to countries in South America or Africa.\nThe other travel vaccines are either not recommended for international travelers or are not as widely used as the yellow fever vaccine. For example, the influenza vaccine is not a travel vaccine. The influenza vaccine is a vaccine that is given to prevent influenza (the flu)."}
