This process can change the structure of chromosomes.\nThe short arms of the broken chromosomes fuse to the long arms of the other broken chromosomes. This leaves the cells with two centromeres and two short arms.\nIf the two broken chromosomes are non-homologous, the fusion disrupts the normal exchange of genetic material that occurs during meiosis. This can lead to abnormal populations of cells.\nIf the two broken chromosomes are homologous, the fusion can affect the normal pairing and exchange of genetic material. This can lead to changes in offspring.\nSOLUTION: In a Robertsonian translocation, the centromeres of the broken chromosomes fuse. The centromeres are the parts of the chromosomes that contain the information necessary for the movement of chromosomes during cell division.\nFusing the centromeres together causes the cells to have two centromeres and two long arms, or two centromeres and two short arms."}

{"question": "The pattern of inheritance shown by malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "autosomal dominant."}, {"label": "B", "text": "autosomal recessive."}, {"label": "C", "text": "X-linked dominant."}, {"label": "D", "text": "X-linked recessive."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is X-linked. This means that the gene affecting malignant hyperthermia is located on the X chromosome.\nA male has one X chromosome. A female has two X chromosomes.\nRecall that X-linked genes do not have alleles. An organism's genotype for an X-linked gene is its combination of alleles for other genes on the X chromosome. An organism's phenotype for an X-linked trait is determined by the organism's combination of alleles.\nSome animals, like pea plants, are autogamous. This means that they can self-fertilize. Autogamous organisms can have a genotype of homozygous or heterozygous for an X-linked gene.\nOther animals, like people, are not autogamous. So, people cannot self-fertilize. People can have a genotype of homozygous or heterozygous for an X-linked gene.\nThe pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia is X-linked dominant. This means that the gene affecting malignant hyperthermia is located on the X chromosome and that the dominant allele is on the X chromosome.\nSo, for malignant hyperthermia to be inherited, the son receives the X chromosome with the"}

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. For example, a Punnett square with a 1:1 ratio of two types of offspring means that, based on the patterns of alleles in the parents, this cross will produce one type of offspring for every one of the other type.\nInbreeding depression is not a genetic phenomenon that is consistent with the observed ratio of offspring types. Inbreeding depression refers to the negative effect of inbreeding, or breeding organisms that are related. Inbreeding depression can cause survival and fertility to decrease.\nEpistasis is not a genetic phenomenon that is consistent with the observed ratio of offspring types.

Codominance refers to the situation in which two alleles, one dominant and one recessive, can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype. But the observed ratio of offspring types is 1:2:1, which is not a 1:1 ratio.\nIncomplete dominance is a genetic phenomenon that is consistent with the observed ratio of offspring types. Incomplete dominance refers to the situation in which an organism's phenotype is between the levels of the two alleles' versions of a trait. The observed ratio of offspring types is 1:2:1, which is a 1:1:1 ratio. This ratio is expected when both dominant and recessive alleles are present in the parents."}

Some syndromes are inherited. An inherited syndrome is caused by a change in a gene or genes.\nA gene is a piece of hereditary material that contains the instructions that affect inherited traits. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn autosome is a chromosome that is not a sex chromosome. Autosomes number 22 in humans.\nA chromosome is a threadlike structure that contains genes. People have 23 chromosome pairs. All but two of these chromosome pairs are autosomes. The two extra chromosome pairs are the sex chromosomes.\nThe sex chromosomes are responsible for determining the sex of an organism. In humans, the sex chromosomes are labeled X and Y.\nA person's genotype for a gene is their combination of alleles for that gene. So, a person's genotype for the flower color gene is F or f.\nA person's phenotype for a trait is their observable version of that trait, which depends on the person's combination of alleles. A person's phenotype for the flower color trait is purple flowers or white flowers.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the F allele for the flower color gene is homozygous for the F allele.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the F and f alleles for the flower color gene is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a gene with two possible alleles. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nSome traits, like blood type, are controlled by genes with more than two possible alleles. An organism's genotype for these genes is their combination of alleles. An organism's phenotype for these traits is their observable version of the trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.\nSOLUTION: Waardenburg syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome. It is caused by a change in the PTEN gene.\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome. It is caused by a change in the TP53 gene.\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis is a familial cancer syndrome. It is caused by a change in the APC gene.\nVon Hippel-Lindau syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome. It is caused by a change in the VHL gene.\nThe correct answer is Waardenburg syndrome. It is not a familial cancer syndrome. It is a familial syndrome, but it is not a cancer syndrome."}

Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Male breast cancer is associated with mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Mutations in this gene are also associated with an increased risk of female breast cancer."}

Other genetic syndromes are caused by new mutations in genes that occur for the first time in the affected child.\nSome genetic syndromes are inherited in patterns. These patterns are called modes of inheritance. The most common modes of inheritance are described below.\nAutosomal dominant inheritance. These syndromes are caused by mutations in genes on chromosomes that are not sex chromosomes. These mutations need to be present in only one copy of the gene for the syndrome to be diagnosed.

The urea cycle is a group of chemical reactions that happens in the body. The reactions break down protein. They also make a compound called urea. Urea is a waste that the body makes when it breaks down protein. It carries excess nitrogen away from the body. Nitrogen is a part of protein.\nIf a child does not have enough ornithine transcarbamylase, his or her body will not break down protein properly. This can cause high ammonia levels in the blood. High blood ammonia levels can be harmful to the body.\nHurler's syndrome is a genetic disorder. It affects the body's ability to break down a sugar called glycosaminoglycan. High levels of ammonia can be caused by this disorder.\nGalactosaemia is a genetic disorder. The body is not able to break down a sugar called galactose. High levels of ammonia can be caused by this disorder.\nPhenylketonuria is a genetic disorder. The body is not able to break down a protein called phenylalanine. High levels of ammonia can be caused by this disorder."}
{"question": "In genome-wide association studies, known SNPs explain ______ of the variation in body mass index despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "only 5%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "less than 1%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "only 13%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "less than 2%"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) examine variations in genes or other genetic markers that are associated with a trait. GWAS can identify specific genes involved in a disease or other condition.\nOne type of genetic marker is a SNP, or single nucleotide polymorphism. A SNP is a change in a single nucleotide. SNPs make up about 1% of the genetic material in humans.\nNearly all SNPs do not affect a person's health or appearance. However, some SNPs may affect the way a gene works.\nGWAS can be used to look for SNPs that are associated with a disease or condition. Because there are so many SNPs in the human genome, GWAS can identify SNPs that explain only a small fraction of the variation in a trait.\nSOLUTION: Twenty-five percent of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is explained by genetic markers. But only 5% of the genetic variation in BMI is explained by SNPs.\nDespite the fact that GWAS can examine a lot of genetic markers, most SNPs do not affect a person's health or appearance. So, GWAS can explain only a small fraction of the variation in a trait."}

This protein is involved in the development of bones and teeth.\nMutations in the FGFR3 gene have been associated with several skeletal disorders.\nAchondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. A mutation is a permanent change in a gene.\nThere are over 200 different mutations in the FGFR3 gene that can cause achondroplasia. Most of these mutations cause the protein to be overly active. The extra protein causes the bones to grow to a larger size than normal.\nCrouzon syndrome is also caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene.\nThere are two main types of Crouzon syndrome. Most cases are caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. These mutations are inherited, which means they are passed down through families.\nThanatophoric dysplasia is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene.\nThere are two main types of Thanatophoric dysplasia. Both types are caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene.\nWaardenburg syndrome is not caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene.\nWaardenburg syndrome is caused by mutations in genes that control pigment in the hair, skin, and eyes."}
