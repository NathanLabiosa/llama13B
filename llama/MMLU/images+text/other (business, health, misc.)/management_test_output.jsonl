The structure of an organization refers to the way it is designed.\nPower is the ability to influence the behavior of others. In an organization, power can be derived from an individual's status, position, or both.\nSome common ways that people derive power within an organization include:\n\u2022 Their job title gives them power. For example, a chief executive officer (CEO) has more power than a secretary.\n\u2022 Their job duties give them power. For example, a human resources manager has power over employees' job status.\n\u2022 Their status within the organization gives them power.

This specialization of labor allows workers to become more productive by reducing the time spent switching between tasks.\nHow is work specialization different from a work assignment? A work assignment is any task that a worker is required to perform. A work assignment can be assigned by the manager or can be chosen by the worker.\nAn assignment may not be specialized. For example, a worker in a restaurant may be assigned to wash dishes. But all of the restaurant's workers wash dishes. So, dish washing is not specialized.\nWork specialization occurs when a worker is responsible for a task that is highly specialized. A highly specialized task is one that is unique or is one that a worker is especially well suited to perform.\nA work schedule is how a worker's time is spread out. A worker's work schedule may include multiple work assignments.\nA work shift is a period of time during which a worker is required to be at work. A worker's work shift may include multiple work assignments.\nSOLUTION: Work specialization is what ensures that one individual does not carry the burden of a whole work task. A highly specialized task is one that is unique or is one that a worker is especially well suited to perform.\nFor example, in a manufacturing plant, one worker may be highly specialized in using a specific machine. This worker is responsible for a highly specialized task.\nWork design is the process of designing tasks and activities that need to be performed. Only highly specialized tasks are work specializations. All other tasks are work assignments.\nFor example, in a manufacturing plant, using a specific machine to produce a specific part is a highly specialized task. But monitoring the production line for quality is not a highly specialized task. It is an assignment.\nWork schedule is how a worker's time is spread out. It includes multiple work assignments.\nFor example, in a manufacturing plant, a worker may be scheduled to use a specific machine to produce a specific part. This is a work assignment.\nWork shift is a period of time during which a worker is required to be at work. It includes multiple work assignments.\nFor example, in a manufacturing plant, a worker may be scheduled to work a shift during which she is required to be at work. This shift includes multiple work assignments."}

The members complete tasks assigned by their line managers and report on their progress.\nIndependent: A work group is independent when its members have clearly defined tasks and goals, but its members are self-directed. The members of an independent work group decide how to accomplish their tasks and assess their progress.\nInterdependent: A work group is interdependent when its members have a high level of interaction and reliance on each other to accomplish their tasks. The work group members must communicate and coordinate their efforts to achieve their goals.\nCollaborative: A work group is collaborative when its members work together as a team to accomplish their tasks. The work group members share responsibilities, make decisions together, and work to achieve common goals.\nSOLUTION: This work group comprises workers with demarcated tasks and distant line managers. The workers have clearly defined tasks and goals, but their line managers are distant. So, this work group is dependent."}

These parts may include up to thousands of people, concretisations of resources, and the relationships between them.\nAn organisation's structure is important because it affects how the organisation functions. The structure defines how work is assigned, who makes decisions, and how information flows.\nThere are many ways to structure an organisation. Each way has its own benefits and drawbacks. The choice of structure will depend on the organisation's goals and the environment in which it operates.\nSome of the key factors that may influence the choice of an organisation structure include:\nthe size of the organisation\nthe nature of the work\nthe need for flexibility\nthe need for coordination\nthe need for simplicity\nthe organisational culture\nThere is no one \"best\" way to structure an organisation. A organisation may also change its structure over time.\nSOLUTION: Specialisation is a feature of all organisational structures. But it is most obvious in the functional structure. In a functional structure, work is organised by function. For example, all marketing activities are managed by the marketing department.\nOther structures may also involve specialisation, but the focus is different. In a divisional structure, work is organised by product line. So, each division is responsible for a set of related products.\nA multi-divisional structure is like a divisional structure, but it has more than one division.\nA matrix structure is a blend of functional and divisional structures. In a matrix structure, employees have two bosses: a functional boss and a divisional boss."}

This approach, called New Public Management, or NPM, represents a major shift in the way public services are managed and delivered.\nThe guiding principle behind NPM is to introduce private sector business principles into the public sector. In this model, public services are treated as products, and customers are viewed as clients. The focus is on reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and improving quality.\nOne of the most notable features of NPM is the emphasis on performance measurement. Public managers who adopt the NPM model often use performance measures to evaluate their organizations and employees. These measures can include outputs, outcomes, and indicators.\nAnother key feature of NPM is the use of economic incentives, such as price mechanisms. For example, road pricing is a policy that is often associated with NPM. Road pricing involves charging drivers a fee for the use of public roads. The fee is intended to reduce traffic congestion and raise revenue for public transportation.\nSOLUTION: The guiding principle behind NPM is to introduce private sector business principles into the public sector. This model is called New Public Management."}
