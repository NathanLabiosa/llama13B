It does this by showing you how to use the inputs to the production process.\nThe production function is a function because it relates inputs to outputs. It is a function of capital and labor because those are the inputs.\nSOLUTION: To decide what to do, look at the marginal product of each input. The marginal product of labor is 200, which is higher than the marginal product of capital. So, labor is being used more productively than capital.\nTo increase profit, the firm should do whatever increases the marginal product of labor. So, the firm should increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises."}

These effects are called spillovers because they spill over from one person to another. Externalities can happen in any type of economy.\nWhen externalities affect the price of a good or service, they can also affect the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. For example, if the price of a good is artificially high, the quantity demanded will be artificially low. If the price of a good is artificially low, the quantity demanded will be artificially high.\nThere are four types of externalities:\nType | Externality\nPositive | A spillover that makes the quantity demanded greater than the quantity supplied.\nNegative | A spillover that makes the quantity demanded less than the quantity supplied.\nIndirect | A spillover that affects the price of a good or service.\nMembership | A spillover that affects which products are produced.\nExternalities exist when markets cannot reach equilibrium. When externalities exist, the equilibrium price and quantity are not optimal.\nSOLUTION: An externality causes the equilibrium price to be artificially high. An externality exists when markets cannot reach equilibrium. So, the equilibrium price and quantity are not optimal."}

Each firm has no control over the price, and each firm sells the same product as all of the other firms. As a result, the price is determined by the market, and each firm is free to choose the quantity of the product it sells.\nIf there are collusive relationships among firms in the industry, so that they can affect the price, the industry is called a coordinated industry.\nSOLUTION: If firms in a coordinated industry cooperate and set a higher price than in a competitive industry, the price is above competitive levels. At this price, the quantity demanded is less than the quantity supplied. Consumer surplus is reduced because some consumers are not able to buy the product at the prevailing price.\nIf firms in a coordinated industry cooperate and set a lower price than in a competitive industry, the price is below competitive levels. At this price, the quantity demanded is more than the quantity supplied. Consumer surplus is reduced because some consumers are willing to pay a higher price.\nThe answer is A."}

An oligopolist can raise its price and decrease its output without losing all of its customers.\nFirms in an oligopolist face a demand curve that is highly elastic. When one firm lowers its price, consumers perceive the price change as a positive event. As a result, the firm sells more units at the lower price. The demand curve is highly elastic because the price change has a relatively large effect on the quantity demanded.\nA demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments is a possibility when a firm faces a highly elastic demand curve. If the oligopolist lowers its price, the demand curve becomes highly elastic. But if the oligopolist raises its price, the demand curve becomes perfectly elastic.\nA perfectly horizontal demand curve is a special case of a demand curve with a perfectly elastic supply curve.

They tell producers what to produce, and they tell consumers how much to buy. For example, when the price of a good or service goes up, the quantity demanded usually goes down, and the quantity supplied usually goes down. As a result of this contraction, the price returns to its original level.\nThis system is called a competitive market system. In a competitive market system, prices are set by the forces of supply and demand. When supply and demand are balanced, the price is equal to the cost of production.\nSOLUTION: Voluntary market exchange between buyers and sellers is the most basic part of a competitive market system. During a market exchange, the price signals provide information to both buyers and sellers. The sellers learn what buyers are willing to pay, and the buyers learn what the market values are.\nPrice signals that guide producers on what, when, how, and for whom to produce goods and services.\nWhen prices are going up, producers know that they should produce more.

There are several things that can make the price of a product change.\nThe supply effect is the effect of a change in the price of a substitute product on the price of a particular product. The supply effect does not affect the quantity demanded. It affects the quantity supplied.\nWhen the price of a substitute product stays the same, the supply effect occurs when the price of the particular product changes. The supply effect is also present when the quantity demanded changes and the quantity supplied does not.\nThe income effect is the effect of a change in the price of a product on a consumer's quantity demanded, other things being equal. When the price of a product goes down, the income effect is usually a decrease in the quantity demanded.\nThe substitution effect is the effect of a change in the price of a product on a consumer's quantity demanded, other things being equal. When the price of a product goes down, the substitution effect is usually an increase in the quantity demanded.\nThe marginal effect is the effect of a change in the price of a product on the quantity demanded. The marginal effect is related to the slope of the demand curve.\nWhen the price of a product changes, the demand curve changes. The marginal effect is the change in the quantity demanded.\nSOLUTION: If the price of a product decreases with the price of a substitute product remaining constant, the substitution effect occurs. The substitution effect is the effect of a change in the price of a product on a consumer's quantity demanded, other things being equal. When the price of a product goes down, the substitution effect is usually an increase in the quantity demanded.\nSo, the price of a product decreases with the price of a substitute product remaining constant, and the substitution effect occurs."}

There are several ways in which the production function can do this.\nConstant returns to scale: The production function allows for a fixed amount of capital to be used with each unit of labor. The output increases, but the amount of capital stays the same. In the long run, the cost per unit of output stays the same.\nThe table shows that as more labor is hired, the output increases, but the cost per unit of output stays the same.

In the long run, the production function tries to decrease the cost per unit of output.\nThe table shows that as more labor is hired, the output increases, but the amount of capital increases more. So, the cost per unit of output increases. So, this is long run decreasing returns to scale.\nIncreasing returns to scale: With each unit of labor, the amount of capital needed increases.

When the supply of a good or service increases, the equilibrium quantity of the good or service will usually rise.\nSOLUTION: When the demand for grapes increases simultaneously with an increase in the supply of grapes, both the demand and supply curves for grapes shift to the right. The higher price for grapes reflects the higher cost of bringing more grapes to the market.

When an externality is present, the quantity demanded by consumers will be different from the quantity that is socially optimal.\nA positive externality is a benefit that spills over to third parties. When there is a positive externality present, consumers will demand more of the good or service than is socially optimal.\nA negative externality is a cost that spills over to third parties. When there is a negative externality present, consumers will demand less of the good or service than is socially optimal.\nWhen there is a positive externality present, consumers do not pay the full cost of the good or service. This cost is subsidized by other people.\nA government subsidy makes the good or service cheaper for consumers. This lowers the price of the good or service. Because the price is lower than the socially optimal quantity, a subsidy makes the quantity demanded by consumers higher than the quantity that is socially optimal. A subsidy corrects for a negative externality, not a positive externality.\nA higher price makes the good or service more expensive for consumers. This raises the price of the good or service. Because the price is higher than the socially optimal quantity, a higher price makes the quantity demanded by consumers lower than the quantity that is socially optimal. A higher price corrects for a positive externality, not a negative externality.\nA lower level of output means that the good or service is produced and consumed at a lower level than is socially optimal. This reduces the externality. A lower level of output corrects for a positive externality, not a negative externality.\nSOLUTION: A positive externality has several third-party beneficiaries. When third parties benefit from a good or service, the quantity demanded by consumers is higher than the quantity that is socially optimal.\nTo correct the externality, a higher price is necessary.

A market is a group of buyers and sellers who come together to buy and sell goods and services.\nIn a monopoly, there is only one seller. In a monopoly, the seller is the only one who can sell the good or service. So, the seller can set the price and quantity to sell.\nIn monopolistic competition, there are many sellers. Each seller sells a good or service that is slightly different from the good or service sold by other sellers. For example, different brands of soap are made by the same company. Or, different restaurants sell similar food, but each restaurant has its own special touch.\nIn an oligopoly, a few sellers dominate the market.

At this output level, the firm maximizes its profit.\nTotal revenue is the function P(Q) and total cost is the function TC(Q). To determine the output level at which total revenue equals total cost, you set P(Q) equal to TC(Q) and solve for Q.\nFor example, if P(Q) is $100 and TC(Q) is $80, you would want to produce the output level at which $100 is equal to $80.

One reason is that consumers have different levels of sensitivity to price. Because consumers are at different points on the elasticity spectrum, they have different price sensitivities. Consumers who are more price sensitive will demand more of a good or service if its price goes down.\nHowever, not all consumers are equally price sensitive. Some consumers are more price sensitive than others. For example, a lower-priced good or service may have a larger percentage change in demand than a higher-priced good or service.\nSo, a firm may charge different prices to different market segments to take advantage of these differences in price sensitivity.\nSOLUTION: When the opportunity for price discrimination arises, a firm will charge different prices to different market segments. The market segments that are more price sensitive will pay higher prices, and the market segments that are less price sensitive will pay lower prices.\nConsumer surplus decreases as a result of price discrimination. Consumer surplus is the difference between what a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and what it actually costs. Consumers who are in market segments with relatively elastic demand face higher prices, and consumers who are in market segments with relatively inelastic demand face lower prices.\nDemand is horizontal when there are no differences in price among market segments. In this case, each market segment will pay the same price."}

Monopolies can use their power to influence the price and quantity of the goods or services they sell.\nThere are two types of monopolies: non-discriminating and price discriminating. A non-discriminating monopoly charges everyone the same price. A price discriminating monopoly charges different prices to different customers.\nA monopoly will often charge a price that is above the market equilibrium price. The monopoly can charge this higher price because there are no other sellers in the market. The monopoly can earn higher revenue by setting a higher price.\nThere are several reasons a monopoly might choose to charge different prices to different customers. One reason is that the customers have different levels of reservation, or minimum, price. Another reason is that the customers have different elasticities of demand.\nElasticity of demand is a measure of how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in the price. If you think about it, you can see that customers with less elastic demand are willing to pay more than customers with more elastic demand. So, a price discriminating monopoly can charge different prices to customers with different elasticities of demand.\nSOLUTION: A price discriminating monopoly earns more revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly. This is because a price discriminating monopoly can charge different prices to different customers.\nFor example, consider two customers, A and B, who are the only customers in the market. Customer A has an elasticity of demand of 2, and customer B has an elasticity of demand of 4. The monopoly charges customer A a price of $100 and customer B a price of $80. The monopoly earns $200 by selling to customer A and $160 by selling to customer B.\nThe monopoly will produce the amount of goods or services that is needed to sell that amount. So, the monopoly will produce less than a non-discriminating monopoly."}

There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.\n | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand\nSupply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up\nSupply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down\nProducers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.\nSOLUTION: The supply curve for lawn-mowing services is likely to slope upward because of increasing opportunity cost of time. The opportunity cost of time is what you give up or miss out on by doing something else. As the price of lawn-mowing services goes up, the opportunity cost of time to do something else goes up.

These changes affect the demand for the good or service.\nSubstitution effects occur when the price of a good or service rises. Substitution effects indicate that buyers will purchase more of a good or service if the price goes down.\nIncome effects occur when the price of a good or service rises. Income effects indicate that buyers will purchase less of a good or service if the price goes up.\nThe law of increasing marginal costs is the concept that the cost of producing one more unit of a good or service rises as the number of units increases. This increase in cost is called the marginal cost.\nAs the price of a good or service changes, the marginal cost of producing the good or service also changes. If the price rises, the marginal cost of producing one more unit of the good or service also rises.\nThe law of diminishing marginal returns to production is the concept that, at some point, the additional output from producing one more unit of a good or service will be less than the additional input. In other words, the marginal return will be less than the marginal cost.\nThis means that, if the price of a good or service changes, the marginal return to producing one more unit of the good or service will also change. If the price rises, the marginal return will eventually be less than the marginal cost.\nThe principle of comparative advantage says that, if one country can produce a good or service more efficiently than another country, then that country should produce that good or service.\nThis means that, if the price of a good or service changes, the comparative advantage of producing that good or service will also change. If the price rises, the comparative advantage will eventually move toward the country that is more efficient at producing that good or service.\nSOLUTION: The downward-sloping demand curve is partially explained by the law of diminishing marginal returns to production.\nAs the price of a good or service changes, the marginal return to producing one more unit of the good or service will also change. If the price rises, the marginal return will eventually be less than the marginal cost."}

Cartels usually do one of two things: set production targets or set prices.\nWhen a market is organized by a cartel, firms can achieve certain results. First, the cartel can help the firms achieve a concentration that would not have been possible under noncollusive competition. For example, in a market with five firms, three of which collaborate in a cartel, the firms can coordinate their behavior to raise collusive prices.\nSecond, a cartel can help the firms achieve a more efficient allocation of resources. For example, a cartel can ensure that each firm produces a level of output that contributes to the cartel's production target.\nA cartel can also help the firms cheat on the cartel agreement. For example, a firm could decide to produce more than its assigned level of output. Similarly, a cartel could establish a price that is lower than the price the market would bear.\nA cartel cannot make the cartel firms more profitable than they would be without the cartel. The cartel can coordinate the firms to raise prices or increase production, but the cartel cannot change the demand curve or the cost curve for the firms.\nSOLUTION: An organized market by a cartel can help the firms achieve allocative efficiency. This means that the firms coordinate their activities to achieve the most efficient use of resources.\nHowever, a cartel cannot make the firms more profitable than they would be without the cartel. If a cartel sets prices or production targets, it can coordinate the firms to raise prices or increase production. But the cartel cannot change the demand curve or the cost curve for the firms.\nIf the cartel sets prices or production targets, the cartel firms may earn normal profits. This happens when the cartel firms sell goods or services at a price that is higher than the cost of producing those goods or services.\nIf the cartel sets prices or production targets, the cartel firms may earn abnormal profits. This happens when the cartel firms sell goods or services at a price that is higher than the cost of producing those goods or services.\nIf the cartel does not set prices or production targets, the cartel firms may earn abnormal profits. This happens when the cartel firms sell goods or services at a price that is higher than the cost of producing those goods or services."}

When the price of a good or service falls below the price floor, the suppliers will charge the price floor.\nA price floor will be located below the equilibrium price. When the price floor is below the equilibrium price, the suppliers will charge the price floor. So, the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied, and the price will keep rising until the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.\nA price floor can be used to correct externalities. When a price floor is set below the equilibrium price, the price floor will correct an excess demand or an excess supply.\nFor example, if there is an excess demand for a fertilizer, the price floor for fertilizer will rise. As a result, the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied, and the price will keep rising until the quantity demanded is less than or equal to the quantity supplied.\nA price floor can be used to correct government policy. For example, the government wants to encourage the production of renewable energy. So, the government sets a price floor for renewable energy.\nIf the price of renewable energy falls below the price floor, the suppliers will charge the price floor. So, the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied, and the price will keep rising until the quantity demanded is less than or equal to the quantity supplied.\nSOLUTION: A price floor will be located below the equilibrium price. So, the price floor will be located below the equilibrium price."}

It shows how the quantity demanded of a good or service changes in response to a change in its price.\nWhen the price of a good or service rises, the quantity demanded usually falls. When the price falls, the quantity demanded usually rises. This is because the good or service becomes more expensive or less expensive relative to other options.\nHowever, the relationship between price and quantity demanded is not always that simple. For example, when the price of a good or service is reduced, the quantity demanded may actually increase. This is because the reduced price makes the good or service more affordable and attractive to consumers.\nThe market supply curve for labor is upward-sloping. It shows how the price of labor changes in response to a change in the number of firms or the demand for labor.\nWhen the number of firms increases, the demand for labor rises. So, the price of labor tends to increase. When the demand for labor rises, the quantity of labor demanded also rises.

One possible reason is that the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect. When the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded will usually increase, but not always. If the price decrease is accompanied by an income decrease, the income effect will be stronger than the substitution effect. The income effect says that an increase in income due to a price decrease will lead to an increase in demand. However, if the income decrease is larger than the price decrease, the income effect will be in the opposite direction, leading to a decrease in demand.\nAn inferior good is a good for which the quantity demanded increases when the price decreases. So, if the good is inferior, the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.\nA normal good is a good for which the quantity demanded increases when the price decreases. So, if the good is normal, the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.\nA luxury good is a good for which the quantity demanded decreases when the price decreases. So, if the good is a luxury, the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect."}

This means that one country can produce more of x in a given time period than another country, and it also takes less time to produce x than it would to produce y.\nOne can have an absolute advantage in producing x and no comparative advantage in producing x. This means that one country can produce more of x in a given time period than another country, but it takes more time to produce x than it would to produce y.\nOne can have comparative advantage and no absolute advantage in producing x. This means that one country can produce x in less time than it would take to produce y, but it still takes more time to produce x than it would to produce another good.\nOne can have comparative advantage and no absolute advantage in producing y. This means that one country can produce y in less time than it would take to produce x, but it still takes more time to produce y than it would to produce another good."}

As a firm hires more labor, the output will eventually increase due to economies of scale. But at some point, the additional labor will cause the output to increase only slightly. For example, if the marginal product of the third worker is 10, that means that the output for the third worker is 10 units more than the second worker. But adding an eleventh worker will not increase output as much as it did for the second worker.\nThe marginal cost of labor (MCL) is the change in cost per unit change in labor. As a firm hires more labor, the total cost will increase. But at some point, the additional labor will cause the cost to increase only slightly. For example, if the marginal cost of the third worker is 15, that means that the cost of the third worker is 15 dollars more than the second worker. But hiring an eleventh worker will not increase cost as much as it did for the second worker.\nSOLUTION: The marginal product of the third worker is 10. So, the firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase."}

Trading can make both nations better off than if either nation tried to produce everything on its own.\nOne reason that trading can benefit both nations is that each nation has a comparative advantage in producing some things and a disadvantage in producing other things. Comparative advantage means that a nation can produce goods and services at a lower opportunity cost than other nations. Opportunity cost is what a nation must give up in order to produce more of a good or service.\nFor example, imagine that it takes 4 hours to produce a good in Nation A and 6 hours to produce the same good in Nation B. In this case, Nation B has a comparative advantage in producing the good.\nIf both nations trade, they can specialize in producing the goods and services where they have a comparative advantage. Trading these specialized goods and services can make both nations better off.\nSOLUTION: If the United States is trading salmon to Peru in exchange for anchovies, they are trading based on comparative advantage. This means that the United States has a comparative advantage in anchovy production, and Peru has a comparative advantage in salmon production."}

The market is not dominated by a single firm, but neither is it highly competitive.\nThe interactions among dominant firms give rise to interdependence. Each firm's decisions affects the outcomes for other firms.\nOligopolies can lead to situations in which firms are able to earn economic profits for a time. These profits are not necessarily high, but they are above the opportunity cost of capital.\nSOLUTION: In an oligopoly market, firms are interdependent. Each firm's decisions affects the outcomes for other firms.\nAn oligopoly is not necessarily an oversupplied market. An oversupplied market is one in which the total value of the goods or services produced is below the cost of producing them. Because there are few firms in an oligopoly, oversupply is unlikely to happen."}
