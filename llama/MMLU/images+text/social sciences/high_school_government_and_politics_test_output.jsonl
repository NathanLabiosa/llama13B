The establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing an official religion. The free-exercise clause ensures that individuals are free to practice any religion they choose.\nThe Supreme Court has struck a balance between these two clauses by interpreting the establishment clause to prohibit the government from showing preference to one religion over others. The free-exercise clause ensures that individuals are not prohibited from practicing their religion.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that once a church has been recognized by the federal government, its tax-exempt status can never be revoked. This balance shows that the government cannot show preference to one religion over another.\nState-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited. The government cannot show preference to one religion over others by sponsoring prayer.\nVoluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed. Individuals are free to practice their religion, including praying, on their own."}

These rules may include the rules for allocating legislative seats to political parties, as well as the procedures for registering to vote, the structure of the ballot, and the rules for counting votes.\nIn a parliamentary system, the voter chooses a party, and the party leader is chosen as the next prime minister. In a presidential system, the voter chooses a candidate, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins the presidency. In a multi-member district system, the voter chooses a party, and the parties that receive the most votes have their part leaders elected. In a single-member district system, the voter chooses a candidate, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins the seat.\nThe effects of an electoral system are not just a function of the rules, but also of the informal norms and conventions that have developed within the system and the strategic choices made by political parties and candidates.\nAn electoral system may have unintended consequences, such as campaigns that are focused on issues that are not important to voters. The costs of running a campaign may also affect the type of candidate who can be successful."}

One of the branches of the judicial system is the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. It has nine members, called justices.\nThe job of the Supreme Court is to make sure that the laws of the United States are constitutional. The justices do this by hearing cases that involve questions of constitutionality.\nWhen a case involves an issue of great importance, other people or groups may want to give the Supreme Court information about the issue. These other people or groups are called amicus curiae, which means \"friend of the court\" in Latin.\nAmicus curiae briefs are briefs that friends of the court submit to the Supreme Court.

So, this defendant cannot file an amicus curiae brief.\nFormer presidents who wish to send instructions to the justices who they appointed are not licensed attorneys or law students who are acting under the supervision of a licensed attorney. So, this group cannot file an amicus curiae brief.\nA senator who wants to impeach a Supreme Court justice is not a licensed attorney or a law student who is acting under the supervision of a licensed attorney.

The institution was created by the Constitution's 12th Amendment, which was ratified in 1804.\nEach state is equally represented in the electoral college.\nEach state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the sum of its senators and representatives. For example, California has 55 electors, based on its two senators and 53 representatives.\nThe results of electoral college voting tend to distort the winner's margin of victory, when compared with the popular vote for president.\nWhile presidential candidates typically campaign in battleground states, where the race is close, it is possible to win the electoral college without winning the popular vote. This has happened twice: in 2000 and 2016.\nEach state must split its electoral votes among all the candidates that receive votes.\nTo win an electoral vote, a candidate must receive a plurality of the vote in that state.

To successfully conduct a filibuster, a senator must make a speech that holds the floor for a prolonged period. The Senate has rules that make it possible to end a filibuster, but they are difficult to invoke.\nBecause the House of Representatives and the Senate are branches of the same legislative body, they have many rules and procedures in common. However, there are also some important differences between them.\nOne important difference is that the rules in the House of Representatives are more strictly enforced than those in the Senate. For example, the speaker of the House can enforce the rules more easily than the president of the Senate.\nAnother difference is that the House of Representatives meets for shorter periods of time than the Senate. This means that there is less time for a filibuster to delay a vote.\nSOLUTION: The rules in the House of Representatives are more strictly enforced than those in the Senate. For example, the speaker of the House can enforce the rules more easily than the president of the Senate.\nSo, debate in the House is in most instances strictly regulated by the rules, whereas in the Senate, a senator can speak on any topic for as long as he or she wants."}

As a result of this, the practice of drawing congressional district lines has been a subject of political controversy.\nThe term gerrymandering comes from a 1812 case when Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts, signed a bill that established a congressional district that was shaped like a salamander. This district was created to help Gerry's party.\nGerrymandering is considered an attempt to give one party an unfair advantage in an election.\nThere are several other methods that can be used for this purpose:\nCracking is the practice of placing some supporters of the opposing party into districts that are likely to elect representatives from the other party.\nPacking is the opposite of cracking. It is the practice of placing most or all of the supporters of the opposing party into one district.\nHistorically, these methods have been used to benefit the party in power.\nFront-loading is the practice of redrawing district lines before the census results are available. This practice can give the party in power a built-in advantage.\nPrior restraint is the practice of restricting what elected officials can do before they take office.

Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to investigate. The investigation power is key to Congress's ability to check on and compare the actions of the different branches of government.\nThe Watergate hearings held by Congress in 1973 and 1974 were a prominent example of congressional investigation. The hearings led to the investigation of President Richard Nixon, who was ultimately found to have obstructed justice.\nIn the case of Nixon v. United States, Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that Congress's power of investigation is not limited to matters involving presidential wrongdoing. The power includes the authority to investigate and report on the operation of the government and on civil matters.\nThe power of investigation is an important check on the president. Congress has the power to investigate the president's actions and the president has the power to veto any legislation passed by Congress.\nSOLUTION: The line-item veto was a power delegated to the president. It allowed the president to remove individual items from a spending bill. The choice it gave legislative powers to the president is incorrect.\nThe line-item veto was found unconstitutional because it delegated too many powers to the president. The Constitution does not allow for one person to have so many powers."}

To determine what that type of change was, look at the column for each critical election.\nFor example, the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 is associated with a change in the role of government. The government had not played a major role in the lives of Americans before the Great Depression, but after the election of 1932, the government began to play a much larger role.\nThe midterm election of 1994 is associated with a change in party control. In the years leading up to the election, voters grew increasingly frustrated with the performance of the incumbent party. As a result, the opposing party was able to win control of both the House and the Senate.\nThe issues at stake in those elections were more important than in most elections.\nThose elections saw major shifts in party alignment that would last for decades.\nMinority voters played a key role in deciding the winners of those elections.\nThose elections took place during wartime."}

There are many committees in Congress, and each committee deals with a different subject area.\nMost bills that are introduced die in committee. This occurs because most committees have strict rules for considering bills.

So, representatives are often interested in their committee assignments.\nA representative may be assigned to one or more committees. Assistant: SOLUTION: This answer is incorrect.\nHouse members may serve on only one committee at a time. But this is not the main reason why house members are more concerned about their committee assignments than senators are.\nSenate committees have relatively little power to alter legislation. But this is not the main reason why house members are more concerned about their committee assignments than senators are.\nBills in the Senate must pass through all committees before reaching the floor.

Some voting systems allow for ticket splitting, which is when a voter supports different candidates from different parties.\nFor example, a voter may want to support a popular incumbent president but vote for a different party's candidate for the Senate. Or, a voter may want to vote for a candidate who shares their views on certain issues, even if the candidate is from a different party.\nThere are several ways in which a voting system may allow for ticket splitting:\nA voter may vote for a candidate from one party for one office and a candidate from a different party for another office.\nA voter may support a independent candidate for one office and a candidate from a major party for another office.\nA voter may support a candidate who is not aligned with any major party for a local office and a candidate from one of the major parties for a statewide or national office.\nSome voting systems make it easier for voters to split their tickets. In other voting systems, ticket splitting is difficult because the voter's choices for different offices are all on the same ballot.\nSOLUTION: Ticket splitting happens when a voter supports candidates from different parties. So, ticket splitting involves choosing candidates from different tickets.\nMayor ordering the local police force to hand out fewer parking violations is not ticket splitting. This behavior is called \"cross-press selling.\" It involves deciding between two candidates or two policy options.\nA delegate to a national party convention supports the front-runner but remains uncommitted on the party platform is not ticket splitting. This behavior is called \"cross-press selling.\" It involves deciding between two candidates or two policy options.\nA presidential nominee selects a running mate who can appeal to voter groups whose support of the nominee is weak is ticket splitting.

In this case, the president's powers are limited by the fact that different parties control Congress in the president's first and second terms.\nA president's power is also reduced when the number and severity of international crises is increasing. In these situations, the president's ability to negotiate with foreign leaders is weakened, and the president's power is limited by the requirements of global cooperation.\nThe economy is strong and the president's approval ratings are high. In this situation, the president's power is limited by his or her approval ratings.

One part of the act is known as the preclearance provision. This provision requires that changes to voting laws in states with a history of discrimination must be approved by the U.S. attorney general or by a federal court.\nSOLUTION: The preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act is a law. It is unlikely to explain low voter turnout for an election.\nLow levels of political efficacy among registered voters is unlikely to explain low voter turnout for an election. Political efficacy is the belief that one's voice can make a difference.\nRegulations that require voters to show identification are more likely to be a reason for low voter turnout for an election. These laws can make it harder for many people to vote.\nThe frequency with which state and local elections occur is unlikely to be a reason for low voter turnout for a national election."}

The legislative branch is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives.\nThe judicial branch is responsible for interpreting federal laws. The judicial branch includes federal courts and the Supreme Court.\nThe principles of vertical federalism state that the national government has more power than the state governments. The principles of horizontal federalism state that the state governments have more power than the national government.\nThe principle of comity means that courts should respect the decisions of other courts. This means that when one court is asked to hear a case, the court will defer to the decision of another court if the other court has recently considered a similar case.\nDue process of law means that the government must follow certain procedures when it enforces laws. For example, the government must give notice to people who are affected by a new regulation.\nThe principle of separation of powers means that the three branches of the government are separate but equal. Each branch has its own responsibilities, and no one branch is more important than the others.\nThe U.S. Constitution describes the principles of federalism and the separation of powers. These principles are important because they help to balance the power of the government.\nSOLUTION: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is part of the executive branch.

This concentration of ownership has led to a decrease in the diversity of news sources.\nWhen a few media conglomerates own most of the media outlets in a market, the news sources become less diverse. This can lead to a single point of view being expressed in the news.\nSOLUTION: In recent years, the number of media outlets has decreased, and the number of media conglomerates has increased. This trend has resulted in a less diverse press that is more likely to present a single point of view.\nDecreasing liberal bias in the news media: The news media is viewed as less liberal because liberal journalists have been laid off, and the remaining journalists are less liberal than before.\nIncreasing visibility for individual candidates on TV: The increased number of cable channels and the 24-hour news cycle have increased visibility for individual candidates.\nIncreasing concentration of ownership in the news media: The number of media conglomerates has increased, and these conglomeracies now own most of the media outlets in the United States.\nDecreasing cost of political ads on TV: The cost of placing political ads on TV has decreased, and political ads now take up more airtime."}

{"question": "Both the War Powers Act of 1974 and the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 represent efforts by Congress to limit the powers of the", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Joint Chiefs of Staff"}, {"label": "B", "text": "House Ways and Means Committee"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Central Intelligence Agency"}, {"label": "D", "text": "president"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In the United States, the president is the commander in chief of the military. The president has the power to send the military to fight wars, but the president cannot send the military into battle without Congress's approval. Congress has the power to declare war, but presidents have found ways to fight wars without a formal declaration.\nThe War Powers Act of 1974 was designed to limit the president's power to send the military into battle. The act says that the president can only send the military into battle for a limited time without congressional approval. After that time, the president must get approval from Congress to keep the military fighting.\nThe Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was designed to limit the president's power to change the budget. The act says that the president cannot change the budget by taking money out of some programs and giving the money to other programs. The president can only change the budget by following special procedures set out in the act.\nSOLUTION: Look at the underlined parts of the question. The question asks about the efforts by Congress to limit the powers of the president. The Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 does that by controlling the president's power to change the budget. So, the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 represents an effort to limit the powers of the president.\nThe War Powers Act of 1974 also represents an effort to limit the powers of the president. The act limits the president's power to send the military into battle without congressional approval.\nThe Central Intelligence Agency is not a military organization. It is the president's intelligence advisor. So, the Central Intelligence Agency does not have its powers limited by the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 or the War Powers Act of 1974.\nThe House Ways and Means Committee is a congressional committee. The act says that the president cannot change the budget by taking money out of some programs and giving the money to other programs. The president can only change the budget by following special procedures set out in the act. So, the House Ways and Means Committee has its powers limited by the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974."}

Ferguson. The court's decision said that \"separate but equal\" treatment of African Americans was constitutional.\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education. The court reversed its decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, saying that \"separate but equal\" was unconstitutional.\nThe first step in understanding why the Supreme Court reversed its decision is to identify the part of the Constitution that was violated in Plessy v. Ferguson.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution on July 9, 1868. Its text is below.\nSection 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\nThe text of the Fourteenth Amendment explains why the \"separate but equal\" doctrine was unconstitutional. The amendment says that no state can deny any person the equal protection of the laws.\nThe Sixth Amendment says that anyone accused of an offense has the right to a speedy and public trial, the right to be informed of the offense with which he is charged, the right to a jury trial, and the right to have the assistance of counsel. The First Amendment lists several ways in which the government cannot restrict speech. The Ninth Amendment says that even if the Constitution does not list a right, the right may still exist."}

The state of California has 53 districts.\nThe Senate has 100 members, with two senators from each state. Senators do not represent districts. Instead, they represent the entire state.\nBecause the House has a larger number of members than the Senate, the House tends to be more responsive to the concerns of voters.

They show that the right to speak, to publish, to assemble, and to petition is not just a right of some people, but a right of all people.\nThe Third Amendment states that the government shall not have a standing army of more than 200,000 people. This amendment was added to the Constitution because the Founding Fathers did not want a permanent army in the United States. They worried that a professional army could be used to oppress people's rights.\nThe Eighth Amendment states that the government shall not use \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" What makes a punishment \"cruel or unusual\"? The answer is not clear. The Eighth Amendment doesn't talk about what makes a punishment \"cruel or unusual.\" Over time, Americans have changed their views on what is \"cruel and unusual.\" For example, the government decided in 2005 that it was cruel to put someone to death for a crime he or she committed before the age of 18. Today, Americans continue to question what is \"cruel and unusual\" and make changes to the law.\nThe Second Amendment states that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The amendment does not give the government the power to take people's guns away. Some Americans think that the government is not allowed to pass any laws about guns. Other Americans think that the government can pass laws about guns. The meaning of the Second Amendment is still being argued about today."}

This process can occur through the consent of the national government or through court decisions.\nThe power to issue driver's licenses is an example of devolution. States have always had the power to issue driver's licenses. Over time, states have taken over this power from the national government.\nAn example of a state being prevented from implementing a more stringent fuel efficiency standard is devolution. The federal government has the power to set fuel efficiency standards. Some states believe that the federal government should have a more stringent standard. By preventing states from implementing their own more stringent standard, the federal government is transferring power to itself.\nA state legalizing marijuana possession in conflict with federal law is an example of devolution. The federal government has made marijuana illegal. Some states have chosen to legalize marijuana possession. By legalizing marijuana, the state is transferring power to itself.\nAllowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets is an example of devolution. The federal government has set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Some states may decide to use the same methods to meet these targets. Other states may use different methods. By allowing states to decide how to meet the targets, the federal government is transferring power to the states.\nA \"race to the bottom\" in which states compete with one another to have the fewest environmental regulations is not an example of devolution. In this case, states are competing with one another to have the weakest environmental regulations. But states do not gain power by having weaker environmental regulations. Instead, they simply do not have as much environmental protection."}

Congressional oversight can take many forms, including hearings, investigations, and the subpoena power.\nOversight activities most often take place at the committee and subcommittee levels. Members of the committees and subcommittees ask questions, gather information, and hold hearings.\nCongressional oversight is not primarily directed at the judicial branch. However, Congress can conduct oversight of the judicial branch, including judicial nominations and judicial performance.\nState challenges to congressional oversight have severely weakened Congress's oversight powers. Congress has the power to investigate, but it must exercise that power in a non-arbitrary or discriminatory way. Congress has not violated the Constitution's separation of powers for exercising oversight over the executive branch, but it must be able to justify actions taken against the executive branch.\nConstituent input does not influence congressional oversight. While constituents can provide information and influence the views of their representatives, congressional oversight is not democratic in the sense that it is directed by popular opinion."}

These laws include rules about how to handle disputes about election rules, how to tabulate votes, and under what circumstances elections should be held again.\nSubtitle H of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) describes the requirements for election procedures. HAVA is a federal law, and it applies to all states.\nUnder HAVA, election officials must provide voters with ballots and other voting materials in languages appropriate to the community. For example, in an area with a substantial community of non-English speakers, voters must be provided with ballots in their native language.\nElection officials must also take into account the special needs of elderly and disabled voters. For example, in a district with a significant number of elderly voters, polling places must be made accessible to elderly voters.\nIn a district with a significant number of disabled voters, elections officials must provide at least one accessible polling place.\nFinally, HAVA requires that all voting systems count each vote cast for a winner. If no candidate receives a majority of the votes, then a runoff election must be held.\nSOLUTION: To guarantee that voters in a region with racial diversity have a chance to elect a candidate of their choice, district lines may need to be redrawn. This is because district lines could inadvertently separate voters by race.\nThe cost of redrawing district lines is a budget issue. So, in a state with a budget deficit, a tax must be collected from each voter to pay for the cost of the election.\nA district with historically low voter turnout needs more polling places. So, in an electoral district that has historically low voter turnout, polling places must be open for longer than the typical work day."}
