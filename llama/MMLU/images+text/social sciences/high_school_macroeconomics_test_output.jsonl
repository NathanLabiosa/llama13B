There are several adjustments that can help the economy return to equilibrium.\nWhen the price level increases, the value of money decreases. So, when prices go up, people will want to buy goods and services at the old, lower prices. They will do this by hoarding goods and services or by buying them before the price increase. For example, if prices are expected to increase by 10%, people will buy groceries before the price increase, so that they will not have to pay the higher prices. By hoarding goods and services or buying them before the price increase, people attempt to maintain their standard of living.\nWhen the price level increases, the value of money decreases. So, when prices go up, people will want to buy goods and services at the old, lower prices. They will do this by hoarding goods and services or by buying them before the price increase. For example, if prices are expected to increase by 10%, people will buy groceries before the price increase, so that they will not have to pay the higher prices.

For example, if the economy is in a recession, people will spend less money, and the price level will decrease. As the price level decreases, the value of money will increase.\nWhen the price level decreases, the value of money increases. So, when prices go down, people will want to sell goods and services at the new, higher prices. They will do this by producing and selling more goods and services. For example, if prices are expected to decrease by 10%, farmers will grow more crops, and manufacturers will produce more goods. By producing and selling more goods and services, people attempt to maintain their standard of living.\nSOLUTION: An expansionary fiscal policy is a type of fiscal policy that increases government spending or decreases taxes. When the government spends more money, it will increase the demand for goods and services. So, an expansionary fiscal policy decreases unemployment and increases the price level.\nThe economy has a demand curve that shows the relationship between the price level and aggregate demand. When the price level increases, the value of money decreases. So, at the new, higher price level, people will want to buy fewer goods and services. As a result of the decrease in demand, the price level will eventually decrease, and the value of money will increase."}

When the demand for money in the economy increases, it means that people are looking to hold on to their money instead of spending it or investing it. This can happen when people expect that the value of money will increase in the future. If the demand for money increases, the supply of money must also increase to keep the price level stable.\nThere are several things that can make people think that the value of money will increase in the future. For example, during a recession, people are likely to spend less money, and businesses are likely to lay off workers. Both of these events decrease the demand for money as a medium of exchange. But they do not affect the demand for money as a store of value. As a result, the supply of money has to increase to keep the price level stable.\nHigher interest rates can also increase the demand for money. When interest rates go up, bonds and other interest-bearing securities become more attractive compared to money. This means that less money is held as a store of value, and the supply of money must increase to keep the price level stable."}

This means that when businesses are confident about the future, they will invest in the means of production, and unemployment will be low. Conversely, when businesses are uncertain about the future, they will not invest in the means of production, and unemployment will be high.\nSOLUTION: Look for the answer that best supports the idea that supply creates its own demand.\nChoice \"It is better to give than receive\" is not about supply and demand.\nChoice \"Demand creates its own supply\" is similar to Say's law. They both suggest that when people want something, they will work to get it, and this work will create the supply.\nChoice \"Supply creates its own demand\" is the opposite of Say's law. It suggests that what is needed is more important than what is supplied.

It is the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending.\nAS is the total amount of goods and services produced in the economy. It is the sum of the amounts produced by consumers, businesses, and the government.\nThere are several things that can make demand or supply increase or decrease. For example, an increase in the money supply or an increase in interest rates will tend to increase AS, while a decrease in the money supply or a decrease in interest rates will tend to decrease AS. An increase in taxes or a decrease in transfers will tend to decrease AD, while an increase in transfers or a decrease in taxes will tend to increase AD.\nSOLUTION: When demand and supply both decrease, the result is a recession. When demand and supply both increase, the result is an inflation. And when demand increases while supply stays the same, the result is an increase in prices and wages. This is called demand-pull inflation.\nWhen demand decreases while supply stays the same, the result is a decrease in prices and wages. This is called a fall in demand.\nA decrease in both AD and SRAS would be a fall in demand. The decrease in demand does not necessarily mean that there is a decrease in prices and wages, but there is a decrease in prices and wages. There is a decrease in both AD and SRAS, so the supply curve is not changing."}

It is an outward-sloping curve that shows the trade-offs between consumption and production.\nWhen the price level decreases, the production possibilities frontier shifts outward. The price level determines the value of the goods produced. A decrease in the price level means that the same set of resources and technology can produce more goods. As a result of the price level decrease, the production possibilities frontier shifts outward.\nWhen labor productivity increases, the production possibilities frontier shifts outward. Labor productivity is the amount of output per hour of work. An increase in labor productivity means that more units of each good can be produced with the same amount of labor. As a result of the increase in labor productivity, the production possibilities frontier shifts outward.\nThe money supply is the total amount of money in a society. An increase in the money supply does not necessarily affect the productivity of resources or the technology used by a society. For this reason, an increase in the money supply does not necessarily shift the production possibilities frontier outward.\nAn decrease in the unemployment rate means that more people are working.

To understand the role of money and financial markets, it is important to understand the factors that affect the demand for and supply of money.\nThe demand for money depends on the opportunities available to holders of money. As the interest rate on a financial asset rises, the demand for that asset falls. As the interest rate on a financial asset falls, the demand for that asset rises.\nThe supply of money is determined by the monetary authority. The supply of money affects the interest rate, as shown in the graph below.\nWhen the supply of money increases, the interest rate falls. When the supply of money decreases, the interest rate rises.\nThe money supply is also affected by the demand for money. So, the relationship between the money supply and the interest rate is not always direct.\nWhen the opportunities for holders of money are plentiful, the demand for money will be high. This will increase the interest rate.\nWhen the opportunities for holders of money are scare, the demand for money will be low. This will decrease the interest rate.\nSOLUTION: A macroeconomic recession increases the demand for loanable funds. The supply of loanable funds is the supply of money. So, a macroeconomic recession increases the demand for money.\nAs the demand for money increases, the interest rate falls.\nWhen demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls.

Unemployment is the amount of time that workers are without jobs.\nWhen the economy is beyond full employment, increasing unemployment is not the result of an increase in aggregate demand. Instead, the short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. This means that as the price level rises in the short run, so does the quantity of output demanded by firms. As a result, the economy can reach the short-run aggregate supply curve, and some resources will be left unemployed.\nSOLUTION: Further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation.\nWhen the economy is beyond full employment, increases in aggregate demand do not increase employment. The short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, so the economy will always hit the short-run aggregate supply curve at some point. At that point, there will be some unemployment. Further increases in aggregate demand will not decrease unemployment, but will increase the price level.\nIf prices are sticky, they do not change. So, if prices are sticky, a decrease in aggregate demand will not lower the price level.\nFurther increases in aggregate demand will result in a lower price level. When the price level is lower, the amount of goods and services that consumers can buy will be higher. So, further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate, but they will create inflation.\nThe short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal. At any price level, the short-run aggregate supply curve shows the quantity of output that firms will supply. If the price level does not change, the short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal."}

This strategy can be used to gain market share in the foreign market. However, dumping can also be damaging to the domestic market of the company, as it may lower the price of the product below its fair market value.\nRaising the price of a product can also be used to gain market share in a foreign market. The higher price will increase the profit per unit, which can help the company gain market share. However, this strategy could also damage the company's reputation by being seen as taking advantage of customers.\nConvincing its government to place a quota on the product is a strategy that can be used to gain market share in a foreign market. A quota is a limit on the amount of a product that can be imported. By getting its government to place a quota on a product, a company can limit the amount of the product that competitors can sell in the foreign market. This can help the company gain market share.\nConvincing its government to put an import tariff on the product is a strategy that can be used to gain market share in a foreign market. An import tariff is a tax on imported products. By getting its government to put an import tariff on a product, a company can make the product more expensive for competitors to sell in the foreign market. This can help the company gain market share."}

This can stimulate the economy in the short run. But in the long run, the government has to raise money to pay off the debt, which can be difficult.\nCrowding out occurs when the government increases the fiscal deficit so much that it drives up interest rates. High interest rates can be harmful to the economy.\nRational expectations is the idea that people, including economists, know that the government will try to save money by cutting spending or raising taxes in the future. So, when the government implements fiscal policy, people will act as if the fiscal policy will continue in the future, even if the government officially denies it.\nThe balanced budget amendment is a proposal to require the government to balance its budget over a business cycle. That is, the government would be required to run a surplus in each year of a business cycle and a deficit only in recessions. Crowding out occurs when the government increases the fiscal deficit so much that it drives up interest rates. High interest rates can be harmful to the economy.\nSOLUTION: Crowding out occurs when the government increases the fiscal deficit so much that it drives up interest rates. High interest rates can be harmful to the economy. Therefore, crowding out is an example of when fiscal policy is not always effective.\nRational expectations is the idea that people, including economists, know that the government will try to save money by cutting spending or raising taxes in the future.

That is, the government would be required to run a surplus in each year of a business cycle and a deficit only in recessions. The balanced budget amendment would make fiscal policy less effective during a recession. As a result, the balanced budget amendment is an example of when fiscal policy is not always effective."}

The government imposes a tariff to make imported goods more expensive than domestic goods. The goal of a protective tariff is to restrict imports and preserve domestic industries.\nThe government can use a protective tariff to help an industry survive or grow. A tariff makes imported goods more expensive, which makes it harder for foreign competitors to sell their products in the domestic market. As a result, consumers may choose to buy domestic products instead of foreign products.\nA protective tariff can also help preserve domestic jobs. By making imports more expensive, a tariff makes it more likely that domestic businesses will expand and create new jobs.\nHowever, a protective tariff can also raise the cost of goods for consumers. Higher prices can reduce the amount of goods consumed, which can lead to a decrease in income for domestic businesses.\nSOLUTION: A protective tariff on imported steel raises the price of imported steel. This makes steel imported from foreign countries more expensive than domestic steel. As a result, domestic steel consumers may choose to buy domestic steel instead of foreign steel.\nSo, income is transferred from domestic steel consumers to domestic steel producers.\nAllocative efficiency is not improved by a protective tariff. Allocative efficiency is the ability of the market to allocate resources to their most valuable use. A protective tariff reduces the competition that can help allocate resources to their most valuable use.\nIncome is not transferred from domestic steel to foreign steel producers. A protective tariff makes imported steel more expensive, which may reduce the demand for foreign steel. But a tariff does not directly transfer income to foreign steel producers.\nNet exports fall. A protective tariff makes imported steel more expensive. This may reduce the quantity of steel imported. So, net exports of steel fall."}

They both represented the value of all goods and services produced in the economy.\nBut as economists have kept track of how prices change over time, they have developed new ways to measure the value of goods and services that take inflation into account. Now, Nominal GDP and Real GDP are used to measure different things.\nNominal GDP represents the value of all goods and services produced in the economy using current prices. So, if prices go up, the value of Nominal GDP goes up, too.\nReal GDP represents the value of all goods and services produced in the economy using base year prices. The base year is a special year chosen by economists as a reference point. Real GDP is a way to compare how the economy is doing now to how it was doing in the past.\nIf the value of goods and services produced in the base year is $200 billion, and the price index is 100, then the value of goods and services produced in the current year is $200 billion x 100 = $2 trillion. But that $2 trillion is twice as much as the $1 trillion produced in the base year. So, the current year's Real GDP is twice as large as the base year's Real GDP.\nSOLUTION: To determine Nominal GDP, take the value of Real GDP and multiply it by the price index.\nSo, Nominal GDP is $200 billion x 200 = $400 billion."}

The economy's performance is measured by per capita gross domestic product (GDP).\nThere are several policy tools that can be used to promote economic growth:\nIncreasing the amount of capital available goes along with the idea that resources cost money. When there is more capital available, there are more machines, tools, and other resources available to produce goods and services. These resources can be used to increase the amount of goods and services produced.\nIncreasing the amount of labor available goes along with the idea that resources cost money. When there is more labor available, there are more people available to work. More people working means that more goods and services can be produced.\nIncreasing the productivity of both capital and labor goes along with the idea that resources cost money. When the productivity of capital and labor increases, more goods and services can be produced with the same amount of capital and labor.\nLower wages might lead to higher employment. But lower wages also mean that there is less money being spent on wages. So, lower wages may not increase the number of jobs or the overall level of economic activity.\nIncreased government spending can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. When the government spends more money, it puts more money into the hands of people who will spend it. This can create a ripple effect that leads to even more spending and economic growth.\nPrice controls may save money for consumers. But price controls may also reduce the incentive for producers to produce goods and services. This can lead to lower output and employment."}

One way it can do this is by adding to the budget deficit. This means that the government spends more money than it takes in as revenue.\nBy adding to the budget deficit, the government can stimulate the economy. For example, it can fund projects to repair or replace infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. It can also provide direct assistance to people who have lost their jobs.\nThese steps, which are known as automatic stabilizers, do not require Congress to pass new laws. Instead, they occur automatically when the economy is in a recession.\nSOLUTION: Automatic stabilizers increase the budget deficit. To do this, the government spends more money than it takes in as revenue.\nIn a recession, the government can increase a budget surplus by spending more money. For example, it can build new highways or fund scientific research.\nIncreasing a budget surplus in a recession does not help lessen the impact of the recession. It makes the recession longer by reducing the amount of money spent in the economy."}

Keynes argued that Say's Law was the basis of Classical economic analysis and that it was the wrong explanation for the Depression.\nSay's Law states that demand creates its own supply. In other words, production will always meet consumption. Say's Law is a principle of macroeconomics.\nThe law is named after French economist Jean-Baptiste Say, who claimed that businesses will never hold back from supplying goods. Instead, they will produce more goods in response to increased demand.\nHowever, Say's Law does not take into account the situations in which businesses may not want to produce more goods. For example, if there is a lack of workers, businesses will not be able to produce more goods.\nIn the 1930 s, many businesses held back on producing goods because there was not enough demand. They were not producing goods because there was not enough money in consumers' pockets."}

More people are seeking work, and a higher percentage of people are entering the workforce. As a result of these changes, the labor supply has increased. An increase in the labor supply means that the aggregate supply curve will shift to the right.\nWhen the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, the economy is able to produce more goods and services. As a result of increased production, the equilibrium price of goods and services will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will increase.\nSOLUTION: An increase in investment in capital will shift the aggregate supply curve to the right. When businesses invest in capital, they increase their ability to produce goods and services. As a result of increased production, the equilibrium price of goods and services will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will increase.\nA decrease in the availability of education and training will shift the aggregate supply curve to the left. With less education and training, workers will be less productive.

So, after inflation, the nominal value of a financial asset is less than its real value.\nThe term \"menu costs\" refers to the idea that inflation can increase the costs of menu barriers.\nMenu barriers are points at which choices must be made. For example, the choice to save or spend money represents a menu barrier.\nWhen the value of money is rising, the costs of menu barriers increase. For example, the cost of deciding whether to spend or save some of the money represents a cost of inflation. Because the cost of inflation is rising, the menu costs are rising.\nSOLUTION: Inflation can lead to resource misallocation. When the value of money is rising, the costs of menu barriers increase. So, the costs of being wrong about the value of some asset increase. For example, the costs of being wrong about whether to buy or sell a stock increase. As a result of these increased costs, some people will choose to forgo transactions that would be best for them.

When this happens, the price tends to stay the same.\nWhat determines the long-run price level? The long-run price level is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand for goods and services. When the supply of goods and services is equal to the demand for them, the price level will tend to stay the same.\nThere are some exceptions to this tendency for the price level to stay the same. For example, prices may go up due to a rise in energy prices or an increase in wages. But over the long run, these factors will be reflected in higher prices throughout the economy.\nSo, in the long run, the price level is stationary."}

When investors put money into a bank, the bank can lend the money to someone else.\nThe stock market is not the source of the supply of loanable funds. When you buy a stock, you buy a piece of a company. When you buy a bond, you lend money to a company or a government. But when you sell these items, you get money in exchange. The money you get is not a loan. It is not sent back to you as interest.\nNet exports are the difference between a country's exports and its imports.

This increase in the money supply promotes more spending, which leads to an increase in real GDP. The magnitude of this effect is called the spending multiplier. The spending multiplier is greater than 1, which means that the increase in real GDP caused by an increase in the money supply is greater than the amount by which the money supply increases.\nA large increase in aggregate demand has a greater increase in real GDP. So, the spending multiplier is the key concept.\nSOLUTION: When economists refer to a large increase in aggregate demand having an even greater increase in real GDP, they are referring to the spending multiplier. The spending multiplier is the ratio of the change in real GDP to the change in the money supply. When demand increases, businesses make more goods and services. The resources for making these goods and services are supplied by the circulating money. The supply of money determines the demand for money, and the interest rate is determined by the supply of money and the demand for money. An increase in the money supply raises the interest rate, which reduces the demand for money. But the supply of money is not affected, so the increase in real GDP is greater than the increase in the money supply."}

The CPI is based on a basket of goods and services from a base period (usually the 1982-1984 time period).\nThe CPI is recalculated every month or every quarter, depending on the country. For example, in the United States, the CPI is recalculated every month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS uses a basket of goods and services to represent the spending patterns of households. The basket includes food, transportation, shelter, and other goods and services.\nThe price of the basket of goods and services is called the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI can be used to measure changes in the average price level of goods and services.\nThe CPI can also be used to measure changes in the purchasing power of a currency. If the CPI rises, the purchasing power of the currency has fallen.\nSOLUTION: The cost of the basket of goods and services the BLS uses to calculate the CPI has risen from $200 in the base period to $400 in the current period. To determine the change in the CPI, consider the effect of the price rise on the value of the basket of goods and services.\nThe value of the basket of goods and services is 400.

When the interest rate is lower, it costs less to borrow money.\nLower interest rates make borrowing and spending more affordable for households and businesses. When households and businesses can borrow money more cheaply, they are likely to spend more money. Increasing the money supply by decreasing interest rates can also increase inflation.\nInflation is an increase in the general price level of goods and services. When inflation occurs, the value of money decreases.\nWhen the value of money decreases, the cost of imports increases. So, when the interest rate decreases, the value of the dollar decreases and imports become more expensive.\nLower interest rates also make investing in the United States more attractive. When investing in the United States becomes more attractive, foreign investors may buy more U.S. assets. This increase in demand for U.S. assets can increase the value of the dollar.\nSo, in the short run, decreasing interest rates may cause the value of the dollar to decrease and U.S. exports to increase. In the long run, the effect of interest rates on the value of the dollar and U.S. exports is not clear. It depends on how consumers, businesses, and investors respond to the change in interest rates."}

Today, economists recognize that international trade can affect the aggregate demand curve.\nWhen foreigners buy goods from U.S. firms, those firms receive additional dollars. If the firms spend these additional dollars on goods or services, that will increase the demand for domestic products. So, an increase in foreign demand for U.S. products will shift the aggregate demand curve to the left.\nOn the other hand, if foreigners do not want to hold U.S. dollars, they will exchange them for their own currencies. When foreigners do not want to hold U.S. dollars, the demand for U.S. dollars will decrease. If the demand for U.S. dollars decreases, the value of the U.S. dollar will decrease. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar will decrease the cost of U.S. products to foreigners.

For example, if the economy is shifting from a focus on manufacturing to a focus on technology, structural unemployment might happen as manufacturing companies lay off workers and technology companies hire fewer workers.\nCyclical unemployment is the short-term unemployment that happens when the economy is in a recession. During a recession, businesses often lay off workers or fail, and new businesses have a hard time getting started.\nSeasonal unemployment is the short-term unemployment that happens when workers in seasonal businesses lose their jobs during the off-season. For example, a hotel may lay off workers during the winter, but hire the same workers back during the summer.\nSOLUTION: The dark room technician who develops film into photographs loses his job because few people use film cameras any more. This means that the technician has been replaced by a machine. This is an example of structural unemployment."}

The bank can use these excess reserves to make new loans or invest in securities.\nThe reserve ratio is equal to the amount of excess reserves a bank has relative to its required reserves.\nThe reserve ratio can be expressed as a percentage. If a bank has $500 in excess reserves and is required to hold $50 in reserves, its reserve ratio is 10 percent.\nThe reserve ratio of 10 percent means that for every $1 the bank is required to hold in reserves, it has $9 it can use for other purposes.\nSOLUTION: The bank has $500 in excess reserves. The bank is required to hold $50 in reserves. So, the bank has $450 in excess reserves.\nThe reserve ratio is 10 percent. This means that for every $1 the bank is required to hold in reserves, it has $9 it can use for other purposes.\nSo, the bank has $9 in excess reserves for every $1 it is required to hold in reserves.

When the government increases its spending, it increases the demand for goods and services, which leads to higher prices and wages. Higher prices and wages increase the total amount of money in the economy. As a result, there is an expansionary multiplier.\nWhen the government increases taxes, it decreases the demand for goods and services, which leads to lower prices and wages. Lower prices and wages decrease the total amount of money in the economy. As a result, there is a contractionary multiplier.\nSOLUTION: The government is increasing spending by 4 and taxes by 4. So, the expansionary multiplier is 4. The tax multiplier is 3, which means that for every dollar the government spends on taxes, the total amount of money in the economy decreases by 3 dollars. For example, if the government spends 4 on taxes, the total amount of money in the economy decreases by 12 (4 x 3). So, the situation is expansionary."}

An opportunity cost is what a country has to give up in order to produce more of a good.\nIf one country has an absolute advantage in the production of a good, that country will always be able to produce that good at a lower opportunity cost than another country. So, the country with an absolute advantage will always be able to produce the good for the lowest price.\nA country has comparative advantage in the production of a good when it can produce other goods at a lower opportunity cost than another country. A country cannot have an absolute advantage in the production of all goods.\nIf one country has a comparative advantage in the production of a good, that country will be able to produce the good for the lowest price when the country cannot produce other goods for a lower opportunity cost.\nSOLUTION: To determine if one country has comparative or absolute advantage in the production of a good, compare the opportunity costs of producing the good in each country.\nOpportunity cost is the price that a country must give up to produce one more unit of a good. So, the opportunity cost of producing a good is lower when a country can produce the good at a lower price.\nIf the opportunity cost of producing a good is lower in one country than in another country, the country with the lower opportunity cost has comparative advantage in the production of that good.\nIf the opportunity cost of producing a good is the same in both countries, neither country has an absolute or comparative advantage in the production of that good."}

They are looking for work, but they have not yet found a new job. Most of the time, unemployment is frictional.\nCyclical unemployment happens when there is a slowdown in business activity in the economy. When this happens, businesses don't have as much need for employees. As a result, they lay off workers. Cyclical unemployment is also called downturn unemployment.\nStructural unemployment happens when there is a change in the pattern of the types of jobs that are needed. For example, if there is an increase in the number of service jobs and a decrease in the number of manufacturing jobs, then workers who are qualified for manufacturing jobs will be structurally unemployed. Structural unemployment is also called structural imbalance unemployment.\nHidden unemployment happens when people are unemployed, but they are not included in unemployment statistics. This can happen if people have given up looking for work. Hidden unemployment is also called hidden unemployment.\nSOLUTION: Bill is considered to be a hidden worker. Because he is not employed in California, he is not included in unemployment statistics. But Bill wants to work as a welder."}

There are several factors that can contribute to economic growth.\nInvestment. When businesses and individuals spend money on capital goods (such as new machines) or on consumer goods, they are investing. Investment increases the capacity of the economy to produce goods and services.\nWorkforce growth. An economy's growth in the number of people working or investing in capital goods can also contribute to economic growth. As the workforce grows, more people are producing goods and services.\nResearch and development. Spending on research and development (R&D) is an investment in technology. New technology can lead to the introduction of new products or more efficient production methods.\nSOLUTION: Increases in interest rates make it more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money. Higher interest rates can slow down growth in investment and consumer spending.\nSpending on education and training increases the productivity of workers. An economy with more productive workers can grow faster. So, spending on education and training is likely to be a deterrent to growth in the economy.\nExpenditures on research and development can increase the productivity of workers and improve the competitiveness of an economy. So, expenditures on research and development are likely to be a deterrent to growth in the economy.\nIncreases in capital can make workers more productive. As a result of increased productivity, an economy can grow faster. So, increases in capital are unlikely to be a deterrent to growth in the economy."}

The nominal value of income is what it is expressed in terms of a particular currency. The real value of income is what it can buy.\nWhen the nominal value of income goes up, but the real value does not, the purchasing power of income has decreased. This is because the price level has increased.\nIf the price level increases, each dollar will buy fewer goods and services than it did before. So, the real value of your income will decrease.\nIf the price level increases, and your income does not keep up, your real income will decrease.\nIf the price level increases, and your income increases at an equal rate, your real income will stay the same.\nIf the price level increases, and your income increases more than the rate of inflation, your real income will increase.\nSOLUTION: The consumer price index (CPI) measures the average change in prices that consumers pay for a basket of goods and services. If the CPI increases by 2 percent, that means that the price level has increased by 2 percent.\nIf the nominal income increases by 8 percent, but the price level increases by only 2 percent, the real income increases by 6 percent.

During the 1990 s and the first part of the 2000 s, inflation was relatively low and stable. During the second part of the 2000 s, inflation fell sharply.\nThere are several possible sources of disinflation. One source is a decrease in aggregate demand, which is a decrease in the total demand for goods and services in the economy. When demand for goods and services falls, prices for those goods and services tend to fall. A decrease in aggregate demand can be caused by a recession, a decline in population, or a decrease in the number of people working and spending money.\nAnother source of disinflation is a decrease in aggregate supply. A decrease in aggregate supply means that there are fewer goods and services being produced in the economy. When supplies of goods and services decrease, the value of those goods and services tends to increase. An decrease in aggregate supply can be caused by a decrease in the number of people working or an increase in the amount of time people spend working.\nA decrease in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply can also cause disinflation. A decrease in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply means that the total demand for goods and services is falling, and the total supply of goods and services is decreasing.\nAn increase in aggregate demand and an increase in aggregate supply can also cause inflation. An increase in aggregate demand means that the total demand for goods and services is increasing, which can lead to higher prices. An increase in aggregate supply means that the total amount of goods and services is increasing, which can also lead to higher prices.\nSOLUTION: The unemployment rate fell from 6 percent to 5 percent, and the inflation rate fell from 3 percent to 2 percent. These trends suggest a decrease in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. When the unemployment rate falls, the inflation rate tends to decrease. When the unemployment rate is low, workers have more leverage to demand higher wages. Higher wages increase the cost of goods and services, which tends to decrease the inflation rate."}

It is equal to 1/r, where r is the reserve ratio.\nThe reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold in reserve. If the reserve ratio is 25%, then banks are required to hold 25% of their deposits in reserve. They can use the other 75% to make loans.\nThe money supply is the total amount of money in the economy. It is created when banks make loans. When a loan is made, the bank creates new money as a deposit in the borrower's account. The loan becomes a deposit that can be lent out again.\nThe size of the money multiplier is critical to the economy's money supply. If the money multiplier is 4, then each deposit can be lent out four times. If the money multiplier is 1/4, then each deposit can be lent out only once.\nSOLUTION: The reserve ratio is 25%. This means that banks are required to hold 25% of their deposits in reserve. They can use the other 75% to make loans.\nThe excess reserves are the deposits that are not held in reserve. If the bank has excess reserves, it can lend them out.\nThe bank has $750 million in excess reserves. It can lend out this amount.\nThe size of the money multiplier is 4. This means that each deposit can be lent out four times.\nSo, the money supply is $750 million x 4 = $3 billion."}

Capitalism is an economic system in which individuals and businesses are left to their own devices to function in a free market.\nThere are several fundamental ideas behind capitalism. One important idea is that competition among businesses will keep prices low and goods and services excellent. Another important idea is that businesses will be motivated to find new, better ways to produce goods and services because the owners of businesses will make more money if they do.\nBut capitalism has also been criticized. One criticism is that capitalism does not do enough to help people who are less fortunate. Another criticism is that capitalism can harm the environment. Many economists believe that capitalism can be modified to address these criticisms. For example, laws can be passed to help people who are less fortunate. Businesses can also be regulated to reduce their harm to the environment.\nSOLUTION: Each of the choices for how a nation can increase labor productivity and economic growth indicates a possible way in which a nation can address a criticism of capitalism.\nIgnoring societal barriers like discrimination would increase the potential pool of talented workers. This could increase labor productivity.\nEducation subsidies could help produce a more educated workforce. A more educated workforce could increase labor productivity.\nPollution penalties could help reduce pollution. Pollution reduction could improve the overall environment. A better environment could lead to economic growth.\nTariffs and quotas could help protect domestic businesses.

When businesses invest in capital goods, they can produce goods and services more efficiently. As a result of this increased efficiency, the economy can grow.\nInvestment tax credits are special tax breaks that businesses can get when they invest in new capital goods. These tax credits make it cheaper for businesses to invest in new capital goods. So, by using investment tax credits to encourage investment in new capital goods, a country's economy can grow more quickly.\nHigher adult illiteracy rates slow economic growth. Illiteracy means inability to read or write. Adult illiteracy rates are the percentage of adults who are unable to read or write. When more people are illiterate, the overall productivity of the economy decreases. As a result, the economy grows more slowly.\nA falling stock of capital goods also slows economic growth. A stock of capital goods is the total amount of equipment, tools, and machines in an economy. When the stock of capital goods is falling, it means that businesses are not investing in new equipment, tools, and machines. So, the economy's efficiency decreases, and the economy grows more slowly.\nMore rapid consumption of natural resources does not necessarily produce stronger economic growth over time. An economy can grow more quickly when it consumes more natural resources. However, an economy can also grow more slowly when it consumes more natural resources. For example, when an economy wastes natural resources, it cannot use them in the future. So, the economy grows more slowly."}

In this situation, the central bank can help stimulate the economy by temporarily lowering interest rates. Doing so makes borrowing cheaper, which can help businesses and consumers. This is an example of expansionary monetary policy.\nThe graph below shows how expansionary monetary policy can help raise aggregate demand and increase the amount of goods and services produced and sold. Expansionary monetary policy does not directly increase the number of available jobs. But with more demand for labor, businesses will want to hire more workers.\nA contractionary monetary policy can help control inflation. If the central bank thinks that the economy is growing too quickly, it can raise interest rates to discourage borrowing and investing. When borrowing and investing decrease, the overall level of demand for goods and services will decrease. This is likely to lower prices and help control inflation.\nThe central bank's decision to change interest rates depends on its assessment of the economic situation. If the economy is growing too slowly and is in danger of falling into a downturn, the central bank may decide to pursue an expansionary monetary policy. If the economy is growing too quickly and there is a risk of inflation, the central bank may decide to pursue a contractionary monetary policy.\nSOLUTION: Under an expansionary monetary policy, the central bank lowers interest rates. This makes borrowing cheaper and can help stimulate investment and consumption. So, expansionary policy would not worsen the recession.\nIf the demand for money is perfectly elastic, then investment and consumption will be very responsive to changes in the interest rate. In this case, expansionary monetary policy might be quite effective."}

In other words, they believed that people would spend the same amount of money on goods and services month after month. Today, however, economists know that aggregate demand can change in the short run. When it does, the economy may be in for a recession.\nSOLUTION: Expectations of surpluses of goods in the future will cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. When people expect that there will be surpluses of goods in the future, they will increase their savings. This means that they will spend less on goods and services today.\nAn increase in government spending will also cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. When the government spends more money on public initiatives or programs, it increases the demand for goods and services. But the increase in demand is less than the increase in government spending. This is because the increased government spending also increases the supply of goods and services.\nAn increase in foreign income will not necessarily cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. The increase in foreign income will increase the demand for goods and services. But the increase in demand is not necessarily less than the increase in foreign income.\nA decrease in income taxes will not necessarily cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. A decrease in income taxes gives people more money to spend. But the increase in demand is not necessarily less than the decrease in income taxes."}

One of its primary responsibilities is to manage the money supply. The money supply is the total amount of money in the economy.\nWhen the money supply is increased, it is easier to borrow money. This makes it easier for people to spend money, which increases the demand for goods and services. When the demand for goods and services increases, the prices of goods and services go up. If the prices of goods and services go up, the value of money goes down.\nTo increase the money supply, the Fed can do the following:\nLower the discount rate: The discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Fed. When the discount rate is lowered, it is cheaper for banks to borrow money. This allows banks to make more loans to people and businesses.\nSell Treasury securities to commercial banks: The Fed can sell Treasury securities to commercial banks. This increases the supply of money in the economy.\nBuy Treasury securities from commercial banks: The Fed can buy Treasury securities from commercial banks. This increases the demand for Treasury securities and puts more money into the economy.\nChange the reserve ratio: The reserve ratio is the ratio of reserves to deposits that banks are required to hold. When the reserve ratio is lowered, banks are allowed to hold fewer reserves. This increases the amount of money that banks can lend out."}

When the world price of a good exceeds the domestic price of that good, traders will bring goods to the United States to sell at the higher world price. This will cause an increase in the supply of the good and a decrease in the price.\nSo, if the world price of copper exceeds the domestic price of copper, we would expect the United States to be a net exporter of copper.\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. If the United States imposes a tariff on imported copper, the price of copper will increase. This will decrease the demand for copper and make the supply of copper increase. The increase in the price of copper will also make the demand for copper decrease. So, if the world price of copper exceeds the domestic price of copper, the United States would impose a tariff on imported copper to protect domestic producers.\nA trade deficit occurs when a country spends more on imported goods and services than it earns from exporting goods and services. A growing trade deficit in the United States in goods and services would occur if the United States is importing more goods and services than it is exporting.\nWhen the world price of a good exceeds the domestic price of that good, the United States will be a net exporter of that good. A growing trade deficit in the United States in goods and services would occur if the United States is importing more goods and services than it is exporting. So, a growing trade deficit in the United States in goods and services would not be caused by the world price of copper exceeding the domestic price of copper.\nThe demand for U.S. copper would not fall.

They treated the decision to hold money as distinct from the decision to spend it.\nThe decision to hold money as a financial asset is called money demand. Holding money as a financial asset allows you to save or invest your money.\nThe decision to spend money is called transaction demand for money. Spending money allows you to purchase goods and services.\nIn the long run, the interest rate is the rate of return on financial assets. As the interest rate rises, the demand for financial assets increases. So, money demand increases as consumers demand more money as a financial asset.\nIn the short run, the purchasing power of the dollar is equal to the interest rate. As the interest rate rises, the purchasing power of the dollar falls. So, money demand decreases as the purchasing power of the dollar is falling.\nSOLUTION: When nominal GDP is rising, the interest rate is expected to rise.

The country's working-age population is projected to decrease, while the population over age 65 is expected to increase. As a result, Japan's labor force is expected to shrink.\nThis shift will affect both labor productivity and economic growth. A smaller labor force means that Japan may need to become more productive to maintain its economic growth. However, an aging population may also slow economic growth, as a smaller working-age population leads to lower economic growth.\nSOLUTION: To determine how this demographic shift will affect labor productivity and economic growth, consider how each is defined.\nLabor productivity is the amount of goods and services produced by a labor force. Labor productivity is affected by the size of the labor force and how efficiently it uses capital and other inputs.\nEconomic growth is the increase in the value of goods and services produced by an economy. Economic growth is affected by changes in labor productivity and the growth of capital inputs.\nBecause a shrinking labor force makes it more difficult to maintain high levels of labor productivity, the labor force is likely the more important factor. So, the demographic shift is likely to affect labor productivity more than economic growth."}

The curve is a downward-sloping line that represents the trade-offs between the goods that can be produced.\nWhen a nation specializes in the production of a particular good or service and trades with other nations, it can increase its production beyond what it could produce with its own resources. This specialization and trade based on absolute advantage can make all trading nations better off.\nAn absolute advantage occurs when one nation can produce a good or service more efficiently than another nation. An increase in trade based on absolute advantage allows both nations to consume more of the good or service that they produce more efficiently.\nA production possibility curve shows the maximum quantities of two goods that can be produced with a given amount of resources. The curve is downward-sloping, which means that as resources are used to produce more of one good, less is left to produce the other good.\nA country's production possibility curve can shift when resources are reallocated from one type of production to another. For example, when resources are reallocated from capital goods production to consumer goods production, the curve shifts inward. When resources are reallocated from consumer goods production to capital goods production, the curve shifts outward.\nThe flow of goods and services is based on the principle of comparative advantage. A nation has a comparative advantage in a good or service if it can produce that good or service more efficiently than any other good or service. Comparative advantage allows nations to trade goods and services and consume beyond the production possibility curve.\nFree trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve. When nations trade goods and services, they can consume a wider variety of goods and services than they can produce.\nNations can consume at points beyond the production possibility curve by protecting domestic industries from free trade. However, this policy can also harm the nation by reducing the benefits of specialization and trade."}

The government can use fiscal policy to close an inflationary gap, which occurs when the economy is experiencing inflation.\nTo close an inflationary gap, the government can decrease its budget deficit. A budget deficit occurs when the government spends more money than it takes in through revenue. To decrease the budget deficit, the government can increase taxes and/or reduce its spending.\nAn increase in the money supply is a monetary policy action. It is not a fiscal policy action. An increase in the money supply can cause an inflationary gap.\nSOLUTION: To close an inflationary gap, the government should decrease its budget deficit.

The interest rate rises, and the cost of borrowing rises for private investors, reducing private investment.\nThe government spends money on public goods and services, such as building highways or educating children. It finances this spending by borrowing, so the total public debt rises.\nThe higher public debt makes investors worry that the government will raise taxes in the future to pay off its debt. Investors demand a higher interest rate to invest in bonds.\nHigher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers. This cost increase reduces their spending, which in turn lowers the demand for goods and services.\nSince the demand for goods and services has lowered, firms produce fewer goods and services. They lay off workers or cut their wages.\nSOLUTION: Crowding out occurs when interest rates rise due to government borrowing. The higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for consumers and firms, which reduces their spending."}

The CPI is calculated by comparing the prices of items in the basket in one year to the prices in a base year.\nThe base year is the year that the CPI is set to 100. The CPI is then used to calculate inflation rates. Inflation rates are important because they indicate whether the average price level in the economy is rising or falling.\nA rising average price level is called inflation. Inflation indicates that the value of money is falling. When the value of money is falling, each dollar will buy fewer goods and services in the future than it will today.\nA falling average price level is called deflation. Deflation indicates that the value of money is rising. When the value of money is rising, each dollar will buy more goods and services in the future than it will today.\nThe GDP deflator is a measure of the average prices of goods and services produced in an economy. The GDP deflator is calculated by comparing the prices of GDP in one year to the prices in a base year.\nThe GDP deflator is used to calculate per capita GDP.

The economy grows strongly, but then hits a period of decline. Then, after a while, the economy begins growing again.\nBusiness cycles are caused by changes in the incentives that households and businesses have to spend and invest. For example, when people expect the economy to grow in the future, they are likely to spend and invest more. But if they instead expect the economy to decline, they are likely to spend and invest less.\nThese changes in spending and investment can affect the overall level of demand for goods and services in an economy. When demand is high, consumers are likely to buy more goods and services. But when demand is low, they are likely to buy fewer goods and services.\nAs a result of these changes in demand, the economy may grow or decline.
