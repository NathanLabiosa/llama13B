As a result of globalization, the activities of individuals and companies are now more closely integrated with those of people and companies in other countries.\nThe map below shows the location of transnational corporations (TNCs) in 2000.\nTNCs are companies that have a presence in two or more countries. TNCs can benefit their home country by providing a source of income from abroad. They can also benefit the host country by providing a source of investment and by creating jobs.\nSOLUTION: Corporations distribute their operations to take advantage of comparative advantage. Comparative advantage refers to the idea that it is sometimes beneficial for countries or individuals to specialize in the production of a few goods or services, even if other countries or individuals could produce those goods or services more efficiently.\nFor example, an industrialized country with high production costs might have a comparative advantage in producing high-tech goods. A less developed country with low production costs might have a comparative advantage in producing agricultural goods.\nBy specializing in the production of a few goods or services, countries and individuals can improve their productivity and output.\nTransnational corporations also distribute their operations based on costs. A TNC will locate its operations in countries where production costs are low.\nProduction costs include the wages and salaries paid to workers, as well as the cost of any raw materials or energy used in production.\nWhen production costs are low, a TNC can sell its goods or services for less. This makes the TNC more competitive in the global market.\nHeadquarters located in LDCs\nTransnational corporations do not necessarily locate their headquarters in LDCs. LDCs are countries with low levels of economic development.\nLocating headquarters in LDCs can be advantageous for TNCs because labor costs are generally lower in LDCs than in more developed countries. Lower labor costs can lower the operating costs of the TNC.\nConducting accounting and research services where economical\nAccounting and research services are important functions for any company. Many of these services can be done from any location, as long as there is a reliable internet connection.\nSo, conducting accounting and research services where economical means looking for the location where these services can be done most efficiently.\nManufacturing goods where production costs are the highest\nManufacturing goods where production costs are the highest is not a good business strategy. High production costs make goods more expensive to produce.\nIf TNCs locate their manufacturing plants in countries with high production costs, they will pass those high costs on to their customers. This makes the goods more expensive than they would be if they were manufactured in a country with lower production costs."}

This system includes all of the places that are interconnected by transportation systems. Central place systems have several basic features.\nThere is a central place, or cluster of central places, that serves as the focus of the system. The central place is where all of the other places in the system can be reached by walking or by using transportation that originates from the central place.\nThe central place is usually a city, but it might be a town or a village. The other places in the system are called peripheral places, or simply peripheries. Peripheral places are usually not as large as the central place, and they can survive only if they are connected to the central place by transportation.\nPeripheral places can be classified by their distance from the central place. The distance classes define the periphery of the central place. The distance classes are usually defined as the downtown area, the suburbs, and the hinterland.\nThe downtown area is the periphery that is closest to the central place. The downtown area contains places of business, including shops and offices.\nThe suburbs are the periphery that is next closest to the central place. The suburbs contain houses, including apartments and single-family homes.\nThe hinterland is the periphery that is farthest from the central place. The hinterland contains things like farms, forests, and mines.\nSOLUTION: This geographer is Burgess. Burgess developed the concentric zone model, which shows how the parts of a city relate to each other. According to Burgess, each part of a city has a different function. The parts of a city that are closest to the center have the most important functions. So, the center of the city is the most important part. The parts of the city that are farther from the center have less important functions. So, the parts of the city that are farthest from the center are the least important parts."}

Sometimes, the boundaries are changed, and so, they can be different from the ways that people naturally divide the earth.\nAn antecedent boundary is one that was used before a geographic change. For example, the boundary between two countries is an antecedent boundary if it is the boundary as it was before one of the countries gained or lost territory.\nA subsequent boundary is one that will be used after a geographic change. For example, the boundary between two countries is a subsequent boundary if it is the boundary as it will be after one of the countries gains or loses territory.\nA geometric boundary is a boundary that is drawn to resemble a shape. A rectangle is a geometric boundary.\nA relict boundary is a boundary that is left over from an earlier time. It is no longer used for its original purpose, but it is still visible on some maps.

This is the difference between the values of the country's exports and imports.\nIf a country's balance of trade is positive, the country has a trade surplus. This means that the country exports more than it imports. As a result, the country has a trade advantage.\nIf a country's balance of trade is negative, the country has a trade deficit. This means that the country imports more than it exports. As a result, the country has a trade disadvantage.\nSOLUTION: To determine which country faces a serious trade disadvantage due to its location, you need to consider the types of goods and services traded and the countries involved.\nMongolia trades primarily in goods, and its neighbors are Russia and China. Mongolia's exports include coal, copper, and livestock. Its imports include fuel, cars, and food. Since Mongolia is landlocked, it may have a difficult time finding markets for its goods. However, Mongolia's trade disadvantage is not as serious as that of other countries.\nSingapore trades primarily in goods, and its neighbors are Malaysia and Indonesia. Singapore's exports include electronics and chemicals. Its imports include machinery and equipment. Singapore is a small island city-state with a highly developed trade sector. It has a trade advantage.\nItaly trades primarily in goods and services, and its neighbors are France, Switzerland, and Austria. Italy's exports include cars, machinery, and food. Its imports include energy, chemicals, and metals. Italy has a trade disadvantage.\nSpain trades primarily in goods and services, and its neighbors are Portugal, France, and Morocco.

These patterns can help us understand the world around us. A theorist is someone who tries to explain things by looking at patterns.\nThere are many different theorists who have tried to explain the pattern of urban growth. One of them is Warren Thompson. He argued that cities grow from the center outward. This pattern is now known as Thompson's law.\nAnother theorist is Daniel Burnham. He believed that cities should be organized according to a plan. This idea is reflected in the name of the Plan of Chicago, which Burnham produced in 1909.\nA third theorist is Thomas Hoyt. He believes that the size of a city is not important. What is important is the size of the area within a city's boundaries. This area is called the urbanized area.\nAlthough these theorists have different ideas about urban growth, they all draw on the idea that cities follow a pattern of growth.\nSOLUTION: Ravenstein observed that the size of cities followed a certain pattern. This observation led to the conclusion that cities grow in a certain way. However, Ravenstein did not propose a specific theory.\nVon Th\u00fcnen observed that the value of land changed as an area changed from rural to urban. This observation led to the conclusion that land use changes in a certain way. However, von Th\u00fcnen did not propose a specific theory of urban growth.\nBurgess observed that urban neighborhoods change in distinct ways. This observation led to the conclusion that urban growth follows a certain pattern. However, Burgess did not propose a theory of urban growth for all cities.\nRostow proposed that all societies develop economically according to a five-stage pattern.

This concentration has a major impact on the economy.\nWhen businesses and people are close to each other, the economy becomes more productive. Productivity increases because it is cheaper for businesses to locate near each other. They can share resources, such as transportation and labor, which makes them more efficient.\nSOLUTION: Agglomeration is the term for the concentration of production activities and people. Agglomeration makes the economy more productive. When businesses and people are close to each other, they can specialize.\nSpecialization means that businesses produce a few goods or services. For example, a town may have one business that makes bicycles and another business that makes shoes. Businesses can specialize because they are close to each other.\nThe substitution principle says that as the price of a good or service goes up, people will buy less of it. This principle is important for understanding the impact of agglomeration on the economy.\nIf the price of a good or service goes up, people will buy less of it. But if the price does not go up, people will buy more of it. Agglomeration allows businesses to produce goods and services more efficiently. So, the benefits of production activities and people being concentrated in one area outweigh the costs.\nInfrastructure refers to the roads, bridges, and other public works that make up a town or city. Infrastructure makes it possible for businesses and people to locate in one area.\nDeglomeration is the opposite of agglomeration. It is the process of moving production activities and people to a less crowded area."}

The movement may focus on a specific cause, such as civil rights or the environment, or it may be concerned with a broader agenda, such as the redistribution of power or resources. Social movements can be influenced by factors such as demographics, culture, and historical events.\nDiffusion is the process by which people or things spread out from a central point. Diffusion can be the result of a decision to purposefully spread an idea, technology, or trend, or it may happen on its own.\nThere are several types of diffusion.\nContagious diffusion is the process by which an idea, technology, or trend spreads from person to person. This type of diffusion often happens naturally.\nHierarchical diffusion is the process by which an idea, technology, or trend spreads from a central or dominant group to a peripheral or non-dominant group. This type of diffusion is often the result of purposeful efforts to spread an idea.\nRelocation diffusion is the process by which people move to a new region or country, taking their ideas, technology, or trends with them. This type of diffusion is often the result of purposeful efforts to move to a new region.\nStimulus diffusion is the process by which an idea, technology, or trend spreads in response to a stimulus, such as a new invention or a major news event. This type of diffusion is often the result of purposeful efforts to spread an idea.\nSOLUTION: The use and spread of English in nineteenth-century India is an example of hierarchical diffusion. In this type of diffusion, an idea, technology, or trend spreads from a central or dominant group to a peripheral or non-dominant group.\nIn India, English was the language of the ruling power. When India was a British colony, English was the language of the government and the dominant group. Over time, more and more people in India began to learn English. As a result, English diffused, or spread, from the dominant group to the peripheral group."}

Migration can be local, regional, or international.\nGeographers have developed a number of theories about why people migrate. Some of the things that geographers consider important to understanding migration include the economy, politics, and social structure of both the area that people are leaving and the area that they are moving to.\nRostow's stages of development provides one framework for understanding migration. The theory holds that economies can be classified into five stages, and that the type of migration tends to change as an economy moves from one stage to another.\nThe table below shows the five stages of development and the types of migration that Rostow believed were characteristic of each stage.\nStage 1: The subsistence stage. The economy is based on farming, and the majority of people are farmers. Migration is based on family need.\nStage 2: The settlement stage. The economy is still based on farming, but there are also towns and cities. Migration is still based on family need, but there is also some migration to towns and cities.\nStage 3: The urban stage. The economy is based on industry, and there are many towns and cities. Migration is driven by the opportunity for greater wealth.\nStage 4: The high-mass-consumption stage. The economy is based on technology and is highly developed. There is a concentration of wealth, and migration is driven by the desire to live in high-status areas.\nStage 5: The age of disorganization. The economy is in decline, and there is a decrease in population. Migration is driven by the desire to find work.\nRavenstein's law of migration is another theory about migration. It suggests that the number of people who migrate from one place to another increases with the size of the population and the distance between the places.\nVon Th\u00fcnen's theory of location also provides insight into why people migrate. It suggests that people are willing to pay more for land that is closer to cities. So, people are more likely to migrate to areas that are closer to cities.\nBurgess's concentric zone model provides a way to think about the way cities change over time. The model suggests that as a city grows, there is a series of concentric zones that form around the city. The innermost zone is the city center, and the outer zone is the commuter zone. Migration to the city involves moving from the commuter zone into the city center.\nSOLUTION: This theory is attributed to Ravenstein.\nRavenstein's law of migration suggests that the number of people who migrate from one place to another increases with the size of the population and the distance between the places."}

These relationships include predation, symbiosis, and competition.\nThe control of fire by early hominids and its later use by humans had a major impact on the biosphere. Fire allowed humans to manipulate their environment and to use it for food and tool making.\nThe Agricultural Revolution was a major step change in the history of the biosphere. This revolution began about 10,000 years ago when humans began to plant crops and raise domesticated animals.\nThe Green Revolution, which began in the 1940 s, was a period of rapid technological improvement in agriculture. These improvements included the development of new types of crops, the use of chemical fertilizers, and the improvement of irrigation systems. The Green Revolution also saw the use of pesticides and herbicides to control pests and weeds.\nSOLUTION: The Green Revolution was a period of rapid technological improvement in agriculture. It was part of the Second Agricultural Revolution.\nThe First Agricultural Revolution was the initial domestication of plants and animals. This revolution began about 10,000 years ago.\nThe Second Agricultural Revolution was characterized by the application of new technologies, such as hybrid seed and synthetic fertilizers.

So, it is not specifically about the effects of GMOs in food.\nGenetically modified organisms (GMOs) are living organisms whose genetic material has been altered. This technique can be used to create organisms with specific traits.\nFor example, genetically modified corn was developed to be more resistant to pests. This means that the corn is less likely to be damaged by pests.\nThe outcome of genetically modifying an organism depends on the type of genetic alterations that are made.\nMay cause irreversible changes in humans.\nIrreversible changes are permanent. So, if GMOs may cause irreversible changes in humans, this could be a serious concern. However, this is not a possible outcome of genetically modifying plants.\nMake plants more resistant to drought.\nThis is a possible outcome of genetically modifying plants."}

This pattern was driven by the fact that cities grew outward from the center, building out circles of streets and inhabiting each new circle as the city grew. Mumford theorized that the pattern of concentric growth was not just a matter of streets and buildings, but also influenced the distribution of social classes within the city.\nIn the 1920s, the German geographer Ernst George Ravenstein proposed a theory of random growth. According to Ravenstein, cities grow in a random or unplanned fashion, with new development tending to occur randomly throughout the city.\nThe American geographer Peter Hall has developed a theory of regional urban systems, which describes the growth of cities in terms of the larger region in which they are located. Hall argues that cities grow in response to the opportunities and challenges presented by the larger region.\nThe British economist Alfred Marshall argued that cities grow in response to the opportunities provided by new transportation technologies.

Hybrid seeds were later used to create new varieties of corn. These new varieties produced much more food per acre.\nThe tractor was invented in 1902. Tractors were much more efficient than horses. They could also be used to power other machines.\nThe discovery of the plow was a chief factor that contributed to the Second Agricultural Revolution. The other technologies were also important. But they would not have been possible without the plow."}

Those elements are: the map, the legend, the frame, and the content.\nThe map shows the geographic area covered by the map.\nThe legend tells you the colors, symbols, and other design elements that are used in the map.\nThe frame is the outer edge of the map. It helps you identify the map.\nThe content is the part of the map that contains the information you need to understand.\nMaps can be generalized maps, which show general information about a region. They can also be thematic maps, which show the distribution of a particular topic or theme.\nA thematic map uses color, symbols, and other design elements to show different values or themes within different areas. Thematic maps can be used to show any kind of information, not just statistical data.\nA reference map includes a map and a set of maps that use the same legend. A reference map shows the geographic area covered by the map but does not show the actual content of the data.\nA mental map is a map that shows the relationships between places as they appear in your mind. Mental maps are not to scale, which means that distances between places may not be accurate.\nSOLUTION: A thematic map is a map that shows the distribution of a particular topic or theme. A thematic map uses color, symbols, and other design elements to show different values or themes within different areas."}

Firms will locate in areas where they can obtain raw materials and labor at the lowest cost. For example, a firm that needs a lot of water will locate near a source of water. A firm that needs coal will locate near a coal field.\nAgglomeration costs are the costs associated with locating a industry near other firms in the same industry. Agglomeration can lower costs by allowing firms to specialize in producing specific parts of a product. For example, firms in a fertilizer industry could specialize in producing fertilizer ingredients.\nAgglomeration can also lower transport costs. For example, firms that need to transport raw materials over long distances can locate near suppliers. Firms that need to transport products over long distances can locate near ports.\nAgglomeration can also lower agglomeration costs. For example, firms that need to share ideas or workers with other firms can locate near each other."}

It was used by air traffic controllers, scientists, and politicians. In 1960, for example, 85% of scientific literature was published in English. However, in the 21st century, English is being challenged as the global lingua franca.\nA lingua franca is a language that is used by people who speak different languages to communicate with each other. Latin was the lingua franca of the Christian world for centuries. Today, English is the most common lingua franca.\nBut English is not the only possible choice for a global lingua franca. Other languages could become more widely used in the future.\nSOLUTION: English is the most widely used language on the internet, which is a major means of communication today. But other languages are also common on the internet.\nChinese is the most widely spoken language in the world. But Chinese speakers use different characters to write their language. So, many Chinese people also learn English as a second language.\nFrench is the language of the international air traffic control. But English is now the most common language used by air traffic controllers.\nArabic is the language of over 400 million people. But Arabic speakers use different scripts. So, many Arabic speakers also learn English as a second language."}

The first, known as the Green Revolution, used advanced technology to introduce high-yielding varieties of crops. The second, called the Gene Revolution, uses genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to resist pests and diseases.\nThe Green Revolution did not reach Africa until the 1980 s, and it did not help much. The primary reason for this is that most African farmers do not have the means to buy the machinery and chemicals required for the new crops. As a result, the adoption of the new crops was much lower in Africa than in the rest of the world."}
