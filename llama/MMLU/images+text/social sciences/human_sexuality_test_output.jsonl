As you explore your sexuality, you may find that different parts of your body are sexually exciting. The regions of the body that, when touched, are sexually exciting can vary from person to person.\nSome people find that the most sensitive parts of their bodies are the ears, the neck, or the breasts. Other people are especially sensitive to touches on or inside the labia, the clitoris, or the anus. Men may be especially sensitive to touches on or inside the scrotum or the anus.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nAll of the above describes the different reasons that the regions of the body that, when touched, are sexually exciting may vary from person to person."}

The fact that infections are limited to genital areas indicates that the bacteria cannot live elsewhere on the body. So, the bacteria that cause gonorrhea are not able to live in the throat or the anus.\nChoice \"D\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"B\" is incorrect.\nA high risk of infection with a single exposure means that you can become infected with gonorrhea after having sex just once. This description applies to a person who has a partner who is infected with gonorrhea.\nChoice \"C\" is incorrect.\nA small number of people have no symptoms. So, a large percentage of people have symptoms.\nChoice \"A\" is incorrect.\nAntibiotics can treat gonorrhea. If the bacteria that cause gonorrhea are sensitive to a certain antibiotic, that antibiotic can treat the infection.\nChoice \"B\" is incorrect.\nGonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease. So, infections are not limited to the genital area."}

Some substances can be harmful to a developing baby.\nCocaine is a substance that can be harmful when used during pregnancy. The baby can be born with low birth weight. Low birth weight means the baby weighs less than 5.5 pounds (2,500 grams).\nBabies who are born with low birth weight may have a greater risk for health problems. These problems can include difficulty breathing, feeding difficulties, and a higher chance of infection.\nSOLUTION: Cocaine abuse during pregnancy is related to an increased risk of low birth weight babies. Low birth weight is a risk factor for other health problems. So, cocaine abuse during pregnancy is related to poorer growth and lower intelligence.\nCocaine abuse during pregnancy is also related to a smaller head circumference. Head circumference describes the distance around a person's head. A smaller head circumference can be a sign of poor growth."}

The egg is surrounded by a layer of cells called the follicle. After the egg is released, the follicle breaks down and releases a substance called progesterone into the blood.\nProgesterone helps prepare the uterus for a fertilized egg. If the egg is not fertilized, the progesterone level drops. This causes the lining of the uterus to shed, which is menstruation.\nOvulation is the release of an egg from the ovary. The egg is surrounded by a layer of cells called the follicle. As the egg matures, the follicle grows.\nAt ovulation, the follicle breaks open and the egg is released. The released egg can be fertilized by male sex cells, called sperm.\nSperm can be found in the male ejaculate. During sex, muscles in the penis press the ejaculate out of the urethra. The male ejaculate includes sperm and a clear fluid with fructose sugar.\nThe fructose sugar helps the sperm travel to the female's cervix. The sperm then travel through the fallopian tubes to the egg.\nFallopian tubes: The fallopian tubes are a pair of tubes leading from the ovaries to the uterus.

Behavior: Changes in behavior, such as seeking out a romantic partner or engaging in sexual behavior.\n2. Physiology: Response of the body, such as increased heart rate or swelling of the genitals.\n3. Cognition: Changes in thought and emotion, such as feeling excited or anxious.\n4. Assistant: LECTURE: According to Walen and Roth's cognitive model of the sexual response, a person's experience of sexual arousal is not just a function of his or her physiology. Instead, a person's behavior, including his or her thoughts and feelings, also plays a role in sexual arousal.\nThe model describes four stages of sexual arousal:\n1. Behavior: Changes in behavior, such as seeking out a romantic partner or engaging in sexual behavior.\n2. Physiology: Response of the body, such as increased heart rate or swelling of the genitals.\n3. Cognition: Changes in thought and emotion, such as feeling excited or anxious.\n4. Evaluation: A person's final assessment of his or her sexual experience, which can affect future behaviors.\nThe model also identifies different routes to sexual arousal. A person can begin with behavior, physiology, cognition, or evaluation, and each step can affect the others. For example, a behavior can be triggered by a physiological response, which can be triggered by a cognition, which can be triggered by an evaluation.\nSOLUTION: According to the model, negative arousal can occur when a person has a negative cognition, such as feeling guilty or ashamed, during the cognition stage of sexual arousal.\nSo, the adult in the example feels anxiety rather than arousal because he has a negative evaluation of his response. This negative evaluation leads to negative arousal."}

Natural sciences seek to explain how the natural world works.\nA hypothesis is a testable statement that explains an observation.\nA theory is a well-substantiated explanation that has been tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation.\nScientists use observations and measurements to develop hypotheses. They test these hypotheses by gathering additional data. Over time, hypotheses that are supported by data become theories.\nSOLUTION: The theory of natural selection is used by sociobiologists specifically to explain the evolution of gender differences. This theory describes how organisms, including people, can have both inherited and acquired traits.\nNatural selection is the process by which organisms gain traits that help them survive or reproduce. These traits are passed down to their offspring. In this way, natural selection can cause traits to be inherited.\nAcquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment.\nSociobiologists use natural selection to explain how behavior, including gender differences, can be inherited.\nThe new synthesis is a theory that describes how organisms, including people, can have both inherited and acquired traits. Like natural selection, the new synthesis is a theory that is used to explain the evolution of gender differences.\nSOLUTION: The gender schema is a hypothesis that has not been thoroughly tested. It is not a theory.\nThe gender schema suggests that children learn gender roles. Gender roles are behaviors that are considered appropriate for males or females.\nChildren do learn gender roles. But the gender schema does not explain how these behaviors are inherited.\nSOLUTION: The theory of sexual selection is used to explain the evolution of behaviors, including mating behaviors.\nMating behaviors, such as dancing or singing, are called sexual traits. Sexual selection is the process by which organisms choose mates with certain traits. These traits may include appearance, behavior, or both. Offspring gain these traits from their parents.\nSocial structures, such as gender roles, are shaped by sexual selection. But sexual selection does not explain how these structures are inherited."}

Females have smaller, hidden gonads (ovaries) and larger internal reproductive organs (fallopian tubes and uterus).\nBoth male and female embryos have an allantois, a cavity that helps remove waste. The allantois later becomes the umbilical cord in fetuses.\nDuring embryonic development, cells called mesoderm cells move to form the muscles of the torso and legs.\nSOLUTION: The question refers to an anatomical difference between males and females. That difference is the external sexual organ.\nThe external sexual organ is the part of the male anatomy that gets engorged with blood. It is called the penis.\nThe external sexual organ of the female is the clitoris. The clitoris is homologous to the penis. Homologous structures are different parts of different animals that have a similar function.\nThe number of nerve endings in the penis is not necessarily indicative of the number of nerve endings in the clitoris.\nThe urinary meatus is the opening where urine and semen exit the body. In males, the urinary meatus is at the tip of the penis. In females, the urinary meatus is between the external sexual organs."}

The appearance of external genitals is one of the factors used to determine the fetus's gender. But it is not the only factor.\nOther factors used to determine the fetus's gender include the chromosomes of the fetus, and the presence of certain hormones.\nChromosomes are the parts of cells that contain genes. Humans have 46 chromosomes. The fetus's chromosomes, including the gender-determining chromosomes, are shed during the first month after conception. These chromosomes are not used to determine the fetus's gender.\nHormones are chemicals that are released by glands. Hormones in a pregnant woman's body can change the appearance of the external genitals. But hormones are not used to determine the fetus's gender.\nThe fetus's gender is usually determined by the fetus's chromosomes. The chromosomes are determined by the appearance of the external genitals. But the chromosomes are not determined by the external genitals. This may seem confusing. But it is important to understand that the external genitals and the chromosomes are not the same thing."}

One follicle becomes the dominant follicle, which continues to grow and releases an egg during the ovulatory phase.\nThe ovulatory phase occurs when the dominant follicle releases an egg, which travels through the fallopian tube. This phase also marks the beginning of the luteal phase.\nDuring the luteal phase, the empty follicle changes into a structure called the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. Progesterone helps prepare the uterus for pregnancy. If the egg is fertilized, the corpus luteum grows and releases progesterone. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum breaks down, and hormone levels drop. This causes the uterus to shed its lining, a process called menstruation.\nSOLUTION: The follicular phase and the ovulatory phase together make up the menstrual cycle. The follicular phase is the first phase of the menstrual cycle. During the follicular phase, the ovaries produce follicles that contain eggs. The ovulatory phase is the second phase of the menstrual cycle. During the ovulatory phase, the dominant follicle releases an egg.\nThe luteal phase is the third phase of the menstrual cycle. During the luteal phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone. Progesterone helps prepare the uterus for pregnancy. If the egg is fertilized, the corpus luteum grows and releases progesterone.

The process of puberty is initiated by the release of hormones.\nThe pituitary gland is an important part of the endocrine system. The endocrine system is made up of glands that release hormones into the blood. Hormones are chemicals that can affect the behavior of cells in the body.\nThe pituitary gland releases two hormones that are important for puberty: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH and LH release is controlled by the hypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus is a part of the brain that produces hormones and controls the release of hormones from other glands. The hypothalamus also senses the level of hormones in the blood. If the hypothalamus senses that the level of a hormone in the blood is too low, it will release its own hormone to bring the level up. If the hypothalamus senses that the level of a hormone in the blood is too high, it will stop releasing its hormone.\nSo, the hypothalamus releases GNRS (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) to initiate puberty. GNRS causes the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH. FSH and LH cause the testes or ovaries to begin producing sex hormones."}

Other people followed his lead, and many books were published claiming that various famous people were homosexual.\nHowever, these claims are often based on very little evidence. For example, it is possible that a person is homosexual, but only has romantic relationships with people of the opposite sex. Or, a person may have romantic relationships with people of the same sex, but not be homosexual. For example, a person may be asexual, or not experience sexual attraction. Or, a person may be heterosexual, but only have romantic relationships with people who are ill.\nSOLUTION: We do not have any evidence about Alexander the Great's sexual orientation. We know that he was attracted to people, but we do not know to whom. So, we cannot say for sure that he was heterosexual, bisexual, asexual, or pedosexual."}
