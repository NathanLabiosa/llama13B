An empirical study can answer questions about how things are related. It can investigate whether two things are merely associated, or if they are significantly associated.\nImagine that you want to know whether there is a relationship between using mobile devices during class and poor performance on exams. You could investigate this question with an empirical study.\nFirst, you would need to observe the behavior of students who use mobile devices during class. Then, you would need to check their exam grades. If students who use mobile devices during class tend to get lower exam grades than students who do not use mobile devices during class, then there is a relationship between the two things.\nA correlation coefficient measures the strength of the relationship between two things. The correlation coefficient can range from -1 to +1.\nA value of -1 indicates a strong negative relationship. Things that are strongly negatively related are often called opposites.\nA value of +1 indicates a strong positive relationship. Things that are strongly positively related are often called twins.\nA value of 0 indicates that the two things are not related.\nAn effect size measures the magnitude of the relationship between two things. The effect size can be used to describe the strength of the relationship.\nSome research studies investigate whether two things are significantly associated. To do this, they calculate a correlation coefficient and compare it to a critical value. The critical value depends on the research study's conditions.\nIf the calculated correlation coefficient is closer to +1 or -1 than the critical value, then the two things are significantly associated. If the calculated correlation coefficient is farther from +1 or -1 than the critical value, then the two things are not significantly associated.\nSOLUTION: To answer the question, you need to conduct an empirical study. The study would investigate whether minority group members seek counseling services more or less than non-minority clients.\nHere are some steps you could take in order to conduct this empirical study:\n1. Select a sample of minority group members and non-minority clients.\nA sample is a group of people who do not include every person in a population. Instead, a sample includes a smaller number of people who are intended to represent the population.\nTo select a sample, you need to figure out how to identify minority group members and non-minority clients. For example, you could ask clients about their ethnicity when they contact your counseling service.\n2. Investigate the length of time minority group members and non-minority clients remain in counseling.\nYou can calculate the time minority group members and non-minority clients remain in counseling by looking at the number of sessions they attend.\nYou can compare the amount of time minority group members and non-minority clients remain in counseling in order to determine whether they remain in counseling for a significantly longer time than non-minority clients.\n3. Calculate a correlation coefficient.\nThe correlation coefficient can help you determine whether there is a significant relationship between the length of time minority group members and non-minority clients remain in counseling.\nIf the correlation coefficient is closer to +1 or -1 than the critical value, then there is a significant relationship.\n4. Interpret the effect size.\nThe effect size can help you describe the strength of the relationship between the length of time minority group members and non-minority clients remain in counseling.\nIf the effect size is moderate or large, then the relationship is significant. If the effect size is small, then the relationship is not significant."}

One way they do this is by asking questions about tasks that require people to use their cognitive abilities. Cognitive abilities are psychological processes that involve thinking or reasoning.\nSome tasks require multiple cognitive abilities. For example, solving a problem and making a decision involve different cognitive abilities.\nWhen psychologists investigate patterns of performance on tasks, they consider gender differences. In the past, researchers believed that men performed better than women on tasks that required spatial abilities, such as mentally rotating complex objects. But more recent research shows that women and men perform equally well on these tasks.\nOther gender differences in cognitive abilities are shown in the table below.\nCognitive abilities | Male advantage | Female advantage\nVerbal abilities | Men are better at these tasks | Women are better at these tasks\nQuantitative abilities | Men are better at these tasks | Women are better at these tasks\nSpatial abilities | Men are better at these tasks | Women are better at these tasks\nRemember that these are general trends, and individual men and women may differ from these trends.\nSOLUTION: Simultaneous processing is a spatial ability.

Categorization is the process of grouping things that are alike. As a result of categorizing, children can understand things about the world. For example, when a child realizes that cats have fur and scratchers, the child understands that wonders are like cats. Categorization is important because it helps children understand the relationships between things.\nCentral and peripheral routes of categorization\nCategorization can happen either centrally or peripherally.\nThe central route of categorization happens when a child pays attention to an object or experience. The child thinks about the object or experience, and then groups it with other similar objects or experiences.\nThe peripheral route of categorization happens when a child does not pay much attention to an object or experience. The child groups the object or experience with other similar objects or experiences on the basis of its superficial similarities.\nPiaget's theory does not claim that children always use one route or the other. Children can use either central or peripheral routes of categorization.\nAccommodation and assimilation\nAccommodation and assimilation are ways that children organize their experiences when they are not sure how to categorize something.\nAccommodation is when a child changes his or her categorization of something. The child thinks that an object or experience is like something it is not.\nAssimilation is when a child categorizes something in the same way as something else. The child thinks that an object or experience is like something it is not."}

One way is to describe the nature of the comparison group.\nNorm-referenced tests compare an examinee's performance to the performance of a specified group of participants. The comparison group may be a group of all students who took the test or a group of students who took the test recently.\nAn examinee's performance is compared to the performance of the comparison group. The examinee's score is expressed as a percentile, which indicates how the examinee's performance compares to the performance of the comparison group. For example, a percentile of 70 indicates that the examinee's performance was equal to or higher than 70% of the comparison group.\nAlternatively, an examinee's performance may be expressed as a raw score or a scaled score. A raw score is the score the examinee received on the test. A scaled score is the examinee's raw score expressed in units of the distance a score of 500 units represents.\nA scaled score can be used to compare an examinee's performance to the performance of other examinees. For example, the average scaled score for all examinees in a grade and subject is 500. If an examinee's scaled score is 550, the examinee's performance is 500 units higher than the average performance of all examinees in that grade and subject.\nCriterion-referenced testing is a type of norm-referenced testing. Criterion-referenced tests compare an examinee's performance to a specified criterion. The criterion is a level of performance that the examinee is expected to achieve.\nFor example, a criterion-referenced test in mathematics might specify that an examinee is expected to be able to solve equations with remainders. The test is norm-referenced in that it compares the examinee's performance to the performance of other examinees. But it is criterion-referenced in that it compares the examinee's performance to a specified criterion.\nFunctional behavioral assessments are a type of assessment used to predict how an individual will behave in a specific situation. Functional behavioral assessments are not norm-referenced tests.\nIntellectual assessments are a type of assessment that measures an examinee's intelligence.

It suggests that you can increase the frequency of a behavior that is followed by a desired outcome. The technique involves rewarding the behavior with an intermittent reinforcer.\nThe reinforcer is a stimulus that naturally follows the behavior and reinforces it. This stimulus is called a generalized conditioned reinforcer.\nAn intermittent reinforcer is a reinforcer that is not always available. It is called intermittent because it is not presented every time the behavior occurs.\nFor example, a man brushes his teeth so that he can eat his breakfast. Brushing his teeth is followed by breakfast. Breakfast is a reinforcer. But if the man does not brush his teeth, he does not get breakfast. Brushing his teeth is reinforced only when it is followed by breakfast.\nAnother example is a woman who waters her flowers so that they will grow. Waters her flowers is followed by the growth of her flowers. Watering her flowers is reinforced only when it is followed by the growth of her flowers.\nAn intermittent reinforcer is a stimulus that occurs unpredictably. The behavior is not always followed by the reinforcer. This unpredictability makes the behavior more powerful.\nSome reinforcers are so powerful that they are called ultimate reinforcers.

Families are influenced by the larger cultural, social, and economic forces, but they are also a force within this system. Within families, roles, norms, and patterns of communication are established.\nA family's patterns of communication and roles are not random, but rather are influenced by the family's history, rules, and culture. For example, a family's rules about independence and self-sufficiency may shape the family's communication patterns and roles.\nSOLUTION: From the information given, decide which description best fits this family.\nDisengaged. This family is not engaging with each other on an emotional level. The father is going fishing on the day of the boy's court hearing, and the sister says she has too much homework. The mother seems unconcerned about the boy's arrests.\nClosed. A closed family system has few interactions with the outside world. This family is closed off from the outside world. The family is not seeking help from the outside world, such as from a therapist or a community organization.\nEmotionally cut-off. An emotionally cut-off family system has an unfulfilling level of interaction and communication. The family is not meeting each other's emotional needs. The father is not emotionally supportive of the boy, and the boy is not emotionally open with the father.\nSkewed. A skewed family system has a pattern of interaction and communication that is not equal. In a skewed family system, one person may be dominant, and the others may be submissive. The mother is dominant over the father and the sister."}

A graphical model called a causal diagram can be used to represent the relationships between latent variables and observed variables.\nLISREL is a statistical software program that can fit models to data and test hypotheses about causal diagrams. LISREL stands for linear structural relations.\nThe only information that LISREL can use to estimate latent variables are the observed variables that are directly linked to the latent variable by a causal diagram. These directly linked observed variables are called endogenous variables.\nThere are several methods of analysis in LISREL. The choice of method depends on the type of causal model.\nMany methods can be used to estimate latent variables. For example, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is often used. However, there is also a simple method that is based on covariance.\nThe MLE is a type of least squares estimate. LeCTURE: Least squares is a method of estimating the values of variables that optimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values. Many statistical methods use least squares to estimate variables.\nThe covariance method is a simple way to estimate a latent variable. It involves calculating the covariance of observed variables with the latent variable and then dividing by the variance of the observed variables.\nThe covariance method is a special case of the MLE. The covariance method is usually only used when the data are informative and there are no unmeasured variables.\nThere are several methods of analysis that can be used to estimate the parameters of a causal model. These methods can be used to test hypotheses about the causal model.\nThe direct method is a method of estimating the parameters of a causal model. This method involves using the covariance of the observed variables to estimate the parameters of the model.\nThe indirect method is a method of estimating the parameters of a causal model. This method involves using the covariance of the observed variables and the latent variable to estimate the parameters of the model.\nThe direct and indirect methods are special cases of the MLE.\nThe covariance method, the direct method, and the indirect method are the only methods of analysis that can be used to estimate the parameters of a causal model. These methods are based on the covariance of the observed variables.\nLISREL does not use the covariance of the observed variables to estimate the parameters of a causal model. Instead, LISREL uses the covariance of the observed variables and the latent variable. This is because the latent variable is not directly observed."}

Identity is the way that a person sees themselves. A person's identity can be made up of their values, beliefs, goals, and habits.\nPeople can have different types of identities. A person may have a failure identity or a success identity.\nA failure identity is when a person believes that they are a failure. They may believe that they will never be successful. A person with a failure identity may also have some negative beliefs about themselves, such as thinking that they are dumb, ugly, or worthless.\nA success identity is when a person believes that they are successful. They may believe that they will achieve their goals and do well in life. A person with a success identity may also have positive beliefs about themselves, such as thinking that they are intelligent, able, and worthy.\nIn therapy, a person can work on replacing a failure identity with a success identity. This is a goal of treatment for practitioners of Adlerian therapy.\nAdlerian therapy is a type of therapy that is based on the ideas of Alfred Adler. Adler was an Austrian psychologist who lived in the late 1800 s. He believed that a person's identity was an important part of their psychological health.\nSOLUTION: To replace a failure identity with a success identity, a person can work on changing their negative beliefs about themselves.

It is illegal for an employer to fire you because of your age.\nThere are different types of evidence that can help you show that you were discriminated against because of your age.\nFor example, evidence of age discrimination exists if your employer says something like, \"We are replacing all of our employees over the age of 50.\" This is direct evidence of age discrimination.\nAnother example is if you are 65 years old and work in a retail store. Your employer tells you that, due to your age, you will no longer be allowed to work in the store. This is direct evidence of age discrimination.\nEvidence also exists if your employer has a policy that applies to older workers but not to younger workers. For example, if your employer has a policy of forced retirement at age 60, that policy indicates that your employer considers older workers to be less valuable than younger workers. This is direct evidence of age discrimination.\nSOLUTION: The question tells you that evidence of age discrimination exists when an employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss. Substantial economic loss refers to a significant loss of money or benefits.\nSo, evidence of age discrimination exists whenever the affected employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss."}

Because the psychologist is assessing the defendant's symptoms, attitudes, and behaviors, any information disclosed during the evaluation could be damaging if it is disclosed in open court. For example, the defendant might disclose during the evaluation that he or she has a illness, disability, or history of abuse.\nAccordingly, many of the questions asked during the evaluation are likely to be confidential. For example, the psychologist might ask about the defendant's medical history or childhood experiences. The psychologist should discuss confidentiality with the defendant before beginning the evaluation."}

Different types of rehearsal can help you process the information in different ways.\nElaborative rehearsal involves connecting new information to information you already know. This makes the new information meaningful and helps you remember it.\nWhen you elaborate on a concept, you add new details or ideas to it. For example, if you are studying a new chemical, you might create a mind map that shows how it is related to other chemicals you have studied.\nSOLUTION: Elaborative rehearsal involves making new information meaningful by relating it to other information you have. So, you can make new information meaningful by thinking about how it is like something else you have studied.\nMaking new information meaningful is different from just consciously repeating it.\nConsciously repeating new information is one way to rehearse information in your mind. But it is not as effective as elaborative rehearsal.\nPracticing a new skill past the point of mastery can also help you learn the skill. But elaborative rehearsal is not the same as practicing a skill.\n\"Thinking aloud\" while studying can help you remember information. But thinking aloud is not elaborative rehearsal."}

But parenting is not just about controlling. It is also about supporting.\nAn authoritative parenting style is both supportive and controlling. The parents explain the rules and give their adolescents privacy and freedom within these rules. An authoritative parenting style helps adolescents develop independence and responsibility.\nAn authoritarian parenting style is strict and controlling, but not very supportive. The parents give the adolescents a lot of rules but do not explain the reasons for the rules. An authoritarian parenting style can limit adolescents' independence and responsibility.\nA permissive parenting style is supportive and noncontrolling. The parents do not explain the rules and do not provide structure. A permissive parenting style can help adolescents feel comfortable and accepted. But it can also lead to increased risk-taking behavior, such as substance abuse.\nA traditional parenting style is controlling and autocratic. The parents tell the adolescents what to do, but do not explain the rules. A traditional parenting style can limit adolescents' independence and responsibility.\nSOLUTION: Independent self-confident adolescents are more likely to have parents who are authoritative. An authoritative parenting style is both supportive and controlling. It helps adolescents develop independence and responsibility."}

{"question": "A woman transmits color blindness to her son although she herself displays normal color vision.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: A woman displays normal color vision. This means that she does not have color blindness. A woman cannot transmit a trait that she does not have. So, the defect the woman transmits to her son represents a characteristic of the son, not the mother.\nThe son's defect represents a characteristic of the son because the son has the same genotype for the color blindness gene as the mother. The son's genotype of color blindness is a characteristic of the son that he inherited from his mother."}

In the 1920 s, a Russian psychologist named Bluma Zeigarnik observed that people were much more likely to remember things that they had started but not completed than tasks that they had completed.\nLater research has demonstrated that people do indeed have a better memory for unfinished tasks. One explanation is that unfinished tasks are more likely to be remembered because they are more relevant to current goals and activities. Another is that people may be more motivated to remember unfinished tasks because they are older and may be more important."}
{"question": "Which of the following training methods will develop 2 response most resistant to extinction", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Partial reinforcement"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Large magnitude reinforcement"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mild punishment for each failure to respond"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reinforcement on every trial"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. These traits include both behaviors and physiological responses.\nOrganisms, including people, use a variety of techniques to learn. Scholars have observed that people learn in different ways. Some people learn best by observing others. Other people learn best by trying things out for themselves.\nLearning can involve different types of learning.\nClassical conditioning is a type of learning in which a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a naturally reinforcing stimulus.\nOperant conditioning is a type of learning in which behavior is shaped by its consequences.\nSocial learning is a type of learning in which people observe and imitate the behaviors of others.\nThe best way to develop a new behavior is to use a combination of classical and operant conditioning.\nReinforcement is what happens after a behavior. Reinforcement can include both punishments and rewards.\nA punishment is a consequence that tends to reduce the likelihood that a behavior will reoccur.\nA reward is a consequence that tends to increase the likelihood that a behavior will reoccur.\nThe likelihood that a behavior will reoccur is called its probability.\nThe best way to increase the probability that a behavior will reoccur is to use reinforcement.\nThe magnitude of a reinforcer is a measure of its effectiveness.\nMild punishments and small rewards tend to have a low magnitude. Large punishments and rewards tend to have a high magnitude.\nThe magnitude of a reinforcer affects how likely it is to increase the probability that a behavior will reoccur. Reinforcers with a high magnitude are more effective at increasing the probability that a behavior will reoccur.\nPartial reinforcement is a type of reinforcement in which a behavior is reinforced some of the time.\nPartial reinforcement can make it harder to develop new behaviors. But it can also make existing behaviors more resistant to extinction.\nExtinction is what happens when a behavior that was previously reinforced is no longer reinforced.\nA behavior that is no longer reinforced will eventually tend to disappear. This tendency is called extinction.\nIf a behavior is no longer reinforced, but other behaviors are reinforced, the behavior that was not reinforced will tend to disappear. This tendency is called extinction.\nLarge magnitude reinforcement is a type of reinforcement in which a behavior is reinforced with a large magnitude.\nLarge magnitude reinforcement is the most effective way to increase the probability that a behavior will reoccur.\nMild punishment for each failure to respond is a type of reinforcement in which each response is followed by a mild punishment.\nMild punishment for each failure to respond can make it harder to develop new behaviors. But it can also make existing behaviors more resistant to extinction.\nReinforcement on every trial is a type of reinforcement in which every response is followed by a reinforcer.\nReinforcement on every trial is the most effective way to increase the probability that a behavior will reoccur.\nSOLUTION: Partial reinforcement makes a behavior more resistant to extinction. This is because partial reinforcement makes it harder to develop new behaviors. But it can also make existing behaviors more resistant to extinction.\nLarge magnitude reinforcement is the most effective way to increase the probability that a behavior will reoccur. So, large magnitude reinforcement will develop a behavior most resistant to extinction."}

If the information is not used, it will be lost.\nSOLUTION: New research has confirmed that images and sounds are maintained in sensory memory for minutes to days, depending on the depth of encoding. Shallow encoding is when a person does not pay close attention to a sensation. Deep encoding is when a person focuses on a sensation.\nFor example, shallow encoding of an image may last only a few seconds.

For example, we might want to know if the average height of students in their 50s is significantly taller than the average height of students in their 30s.\nTo answer this question, we can conduct a two-tailed t test. The t test calculates the probability that the mean height of the 50s group is greater than the mean height of the 30s group, or where the null hypothesis is rejected. If the null hypothesis is rejected, we can conclude that the two groups are significantly different.\nThe t test has two types of errors that can be made:\nType I error: The test falsely concludes that there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.\nType II error: The test falsely concludes that there is no significant difference between the means of the two groups.\nThe probability of making a type I error is denoted by the value alpha, or \u03b1. The value of alpha is set before the test is conducted. A commonly used value of alpha is 0.05.\nIf the probability of making a type I error is 0.05, then the probability of making a type II error is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\nSo, if the probability of making a type I error is 0.05, the probability of making a type II error is 0.95.\nSOLUTION: To determine the probability of making a type II error, use the probability of making a type I error and the power of the test.\nThe power of a test is a measure of the probability that the test will detect a true difference between the means of two groups. In other words, the power of a test is the probability that the test will reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.\nThe power of a two-tailed t test with alpha = 0.05 is 0.85.

This process can be described in terms of stages.\nThe stages of racial/cultural identity development are as follows:\n1. Identify: A person who is just beginning to become aware of their racial and cultural identities may be in this stage. These individuals are just starting to think about their race and culture.\n2. Assimilation: A person who is in the assimilation stage is learning about their race and culture and how they fit into the dominant culture. They may be trying to fit in with people who share their cultural background.\n3. Dissonance: A person who is in the dissonance stage has changed their behavior or attitudes about their race or culture to fit in with a new group. This person may be feeling conflict between their own values and the values of the group they have joined.\n4. Resistance and immersion: A person who is in the resistance and immersion stage has rejected the dominant culture and is embracing their minority cultural identity. This person may be more aware of discrimination and may be active in social justice efforts.\n5. Integration: A person who is in the integration stage has found a way to balance their minority cultural identity with their dominant cultural identity. This person may feel that their cultural groups can both be a part of their identity.\n6. Awareness: A person who is in the awareness stage has a strong understanding of their racial and cultural identities.

Instead, it can be built into the normal operations of society and its institutions. These types of racism are often called systemic or institutional.\nInstitutional racism is like an invisible barrier that makes it harder for some people to succeed. It is often unintentional, but it affects people of color more heavily.\nSOLUTION: Sociologists use the term institutional racism to describe situations in which institutions that are meant to be fair and open to all people actually keep certain groups from getting ahead. We call these institutions racist because they are designed in a way that looks neutral on the surface but ends up giving unfair advantages to some groups and disadvantages to others.\nFor example, a college that looks like it is making an equal-opportunity decision to admit 60% of its students from one racial group may not seem racist. But if that group is overrepresented in the college because of its higher income status, the college is actually disadvantaging students from other racial and ethnic backgrounds.\nThe correct answer is C."}

They can be caused by genes, childhood experiences, or other factors.\nMany mental disorders are functional, which means that they may be caused by the brain's response to a stressor. Stressors are events that change the brain's balance of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that cells in the brain use to communicate with each other.\nSome stressors are easily identified. For example, a major injury or illness is a stressor. Other stressors are more difficult to identify. For example, a unpredictable environment or a difficult relationship may act as a stressor.\nFunctional psychiatric disorders are more common in older adults. This may be because older adults have longer life exposure to stressors. It is also possible that the effects of stress on the brain are more severe as people age.\nSOLUTION: Depression is a common functional psychiatric disorder of later life. Depression may cause a change in mood, a change in activity level, or a change in appetite.\nHypochondriasis is a functional psychiatric disorder that may cause a person to obsess about their health. They may believe that they have a serious illness, even when a doctor says there is nothing wrong.\nAgoraphobia is a type of phobia.

Therapists' fees should be reasonable and should not be based on the client's diagnostic label or on the client's willingness to pay.\nOne way to establish fees is on a sliding scale, based on the client's income. A sliding scale allows therapists to provide services to clients who might not be able to afford full fee sessions. However, the scale should be reasonable and should not penalize clients who are doing well financially.\nAnother way to charge for services is to have a standard fee for all clients. This method is simple and does not involve assessing clients' income.\nA therapist may choose to use a sliding fee scale, or she may charge a standard fee for all clients. The fee structure a therapist chooses is not necessarily an ethical issue. However, the fee structure should not create a conflict of interest or exploit the client.\nSOLUTION: The fact that Dr. Manzetti's fees are based on his clients' income is not, in and of itself, ethically problematic. However, the arrangement could be exploitative if Dr. Manzetti charges higher fees to clients with lower incomes.\nThe key to an ethical fee structure is that it serves the client's best interests. A fee structure serves the client's best interests if it is reasonable, non-exploitative, and does not create a conflict of interest."}

One important principle is the obligation to report unethical or unlawful behavior to the appropriate authorities. This is true even if the client asks you to keep the information confidential. If you do not report such behavior, you could be violating your ethical code.\nPsychologists abide by a strict code of ethics. These codes state that psychologists are to provide confidential care to their clients. Confidentiality means that the psychologist cannot disclose information about the client to others.\nThere are limits to confidentiality. There are certain situations in which a psychologist is allowed to disclose information about a client. For example, a psychologist may disclose information to prevent harm to the client or to others.\nSOLUTION: The psychologist is obligated to inform the client of the limits of confidentiality and report the unethical behavior. The psychologist cannot disclose the client's confidential information to others. However, the psychologist should inform the client that she is required to report the unethical behavior to an authority."}

These benchmarks will affect your predictions of what you deserve, and therefore your level of satisfaction.\nFor example, if you compare yourself to others who have a better partner (as you perceive them) than you do, you may feel unhappy and want to end your relationship. This feeling of dissatisfaction comes from comparing your partner to an unfair benchmark.\nOn the other hand, if you compare yourself to others who have a worse partner, you may feel more satisfied with your relationship. This feeling of satisfaction comes from comparing your partner to a more fair benchmark.\nSOLUTION: Look at the perceptions of the relative utility of the relationship. This describes the choice that is likely to lead to the greatest satisfaction.\nIf you perceive that your relationship is better than your partner's relationship, you will feel more satisfied. If you perceive that your partner's relationship is better than yours, you will feel less satisfied."}

The person may remember an event but not be able to remember where he learned it.\nTransient global amnesia is the temporary loss of memory. The person may lose the ability to form new memories, but the amnesia usually lasts only a day.\nPermanent amnesia is the permanent loss of memory. The person does not regain the ability to form new memories.\nSome people with amnesic disorders confabulate to fill in gaps in their memory. Confabulation is the creation of false memories.\nAmnesic disorders can be associated with hypnotics and sedatives. These drugs can cause memory impairment."}

Some assessments use experimental methods, while others use observational methods.\nExperimental methods involve directly manipulating variables within the environment to observe their effect on behavior. These assessments are sometimes called \"inferential\" because they infer what happens when variables are changed.\nObservational methods involve observing behavior in the environment to gather information about the effects of variables on behavior. These assessments are sometimes called \"descriptive\" because they describe the effects of variables on behavior.\nFunctional behavioral assessments are observational assessments that focus on the relationship between environment and behavior. They examine the relationship between the variables in the environment and the behavior of the person being assessed.\nA functional behavioral assessment may involve:\nobserving the person in different environments\nrecording the behavior of the person and the environment\nchanging the environment and observing the effect on the person's behavior.\nA work sample is an observational assessment that involves having the person complete a task or solve a problem. The work sample can be compared to other people's work samples to assess the person's skills.\nA norm-referenced test is a descriptive assessment that compares a person's scores to those of other people. These tests tell you how a person's behavior compares to the behavior of other people.\nAn ecological assessment is an observational assessment that examines the relationship between the person and the environment. It may involve observing the person in different environments and assessing the effect of the environment on the person's behavior.

When the id and the superego come into conflict, the ego acts as an intermediary.\nThe id is the part of the personality that contains the individual's basic impulses. The id seeks immediate gratification of all desires.\nThe superego is the part of the personality that contains the individual's sense of right and wrong. The superego develops from the moral and ethical rules of the person's culture.\nThe ego is the part of the personality that mediates between the id and the superego. The ego selects impulses from the id that can be expressed immediately and aligns them with the superego.\nWhen the id and the superego come into conflict, the ego finds a compromise. This compromise is called a defense mechanism.\nThere are many defense mechanisms, but they can be grouped into four main types.\nRegression is the retreat to an earlier stage of development. A child might worry about a dark room by holding a favorite stuffed animal.\nRepression is the blanking out of unacceptable thoughts or feelings. A person might drive to work without noticing the drive-thru where the person's coffee went wrong.\nProjection is the attribution of one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. A person might believe that a coworker is annoyed with them, when the coworker is just focused on work.\nFixation is a preoccupation with a past experience. A person might become obsessed with a past failure and be unable to move forward.\nSOLUTION: In classical psychoanalytic theory, a maladaptive behavior that emerges as a compromise between an unconscious impulse and the resulting defense process is called a symptom."}

To do this, people focus on the arguments and evidence that the message presents.\nThe peripheral route involves superficial, or shallow, processing of the message. To do this, people focus on the source of the message or the context in which it is presented.\nThe model assumes that people use the central route when they are in a critical mood or when they have a high motivation to think carefully. It assumes that people use the peripheral route when they are in a noncritical mood or when they have a low motivation to think carefully.\nThe latitude of acceptance is the range of positions that a person finds acceptable. It is broad for some people and narrow for others. According to the model, people are more likely to rely on the central route when the message is within their latitude of acceptance.\nSOLUTION: The model predicts that people will rely on the central route when they are in a neutral or slightly negative mood. This is because being in a neutral or slightly negative mood tends to make people more critical and more likely to use the central route."}

Individuals are socialized into gender roles by their family, friends, and the media. Parents and other family members have different expectations for how boys and girls should behave. For example, parents may encourage boys to be independent and adventurous and girls to be compliant and nurturing.\nChildren play a significant role in gender-role development. Gender schemas help children make sense of the world. Gender schemas also influence what types of toys and activities children choose. For example, girls may be more likely to play with dolls and boys may be more likely to play with trucks.\nCognitive development also influences gender-role development. As children develop, they become more aware of gender differences and come to understand that gender roles are socially expected.\nSocial learning theory suggests that children learn gender-role behavior by observing and imitating others. Parents, family members, and friends are important models for children.\nPsychodynamic theory proposes that personality develops through the resolution of conflicts. Children may experience conflicts between their biological sex and their gender role. These conflicts may influence personality development."}

This is because intergroup contact can lead to increased knowledge, which can lead to increased trust and improved intergroup relations.\nBut not all types of intergroup contact reduce intergroup hostility. Contact between groups that is designed to promote cooperation and collaboration is more likely to reduce hostility than contact that is designed to create competition.\nIntegrative demands are tasks that require group members to work together to achieve a common goal. Integrative demands promote cooperation and collaboration, which can reduce intergroup hostility.\nSuperordinate goals are goals that are bigger than the groups in question. Superordinate goals can help groups overcome their differences and work together to achieve the common goal. Superordinate goals can also reduce intergroup hostility.\nThreat reduction is an approach that emphasizes the similarities between groups and de-emphasizes the differences.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different forms, or alleles.\nSome genes have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as if they were a single type.\nA dominant gene is one that can cause its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene.\nA recessive gene is one that can cause its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene.\nSome genes are called necessary because they are required for an organism to have a particular trait. These genes do not have any types.\nSome genes are called optional because they are not required for an organism to have a particular trait. These genes do have types.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, an organism's genotype may be dominant or recessive.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. If an organism's genotype is dominant, its phenotype is also dominant. If an organism's genotype is recessive, its phenotype is also recessive.\nSOLUTION: Down Syndrome is caused by an extra copy of a gene on chromosome 21.

When deceception is necessary, researchers must justify its use. They must clearly describe the reasons for the deception and show that it is necessary to achieve the study's goals. They must also be sure that the deception is the least deceptive approach that will achieve these goals.\nSOLUTION: The study's prospective value is the first consideration in deciding whether deception is justified. Deception is not justified if the purpose of the study is to deceive the participants.\nThe other considerations are the deceptive nature of the study and the vulnerability of the participants. The nature of the study is deceptive if the participants would not know that the study is taking place if they were not deceived. The vulnerability of the participants is low if the participants are not at risk of being physically, mentally, or socially harmed by participating in the study."}
{"question": "According to EQUITY THEORY in any work situation, people assess both their inputs and outcomes and compare the ratio to other workers and underpayment has a greater impact on worker performance than overpayment.

When people perceive that their outcomes are underpayment relative to others, this difference is perceived as inequitable and has a greater impact on worker performance.\nThis means that the fairness of outcomes refers to how much people are paid. When employees feel that they are being paid less than other employees for the same work, they perceive this as unfair.\nThe fairness of procedures refers to the fairness of the procedures used to determine outcomes. Employees expect to be treated fairly in the way decisions are made about their pay, promotions, and other work-related benefits.\nInconsistency of treatment refers to the problem of treating similarly situated employees differently. For example, if employees believe that their coworkers are being paid more for the same work, they may perceive this as unfair.\nPerceptions of outcome refer to the comparison of one's own outcomes to those of other employees. When employees perceive that they are being underpaid relative to others, they may become demotivated and less productive."}

Social power is the power that is built on the patterns of social relationships. The three key aspects of social power are the ones that are most often the focus of analysis.\nThe first aspect of social power is reward power. Reward power is based on the ability to give others what they want or need. Reward power can take different forms, such as money, praise, or other tokens of appreciation.\nThe second aspect of social power is legitimate power. Legitimate power is based on the acceptance of the power holder's authority. Legitimate power can come from formal positions of authority, such as a supervisor or manager, or it can come from informal positions of authority, such as a respected advisor.\nThe third aspect of social power is informational power. Informational power is based on the power to access and control information. Informational power can be used to manipulate others, but it can also be used to persuade others.\nExpert power is based on the knowledge and skills that a person has. Expert power can give the power holder more influence over others, but it can also give the power holder more responsibility.\nPersonal power is based on the power that comes from being well-liked, or from having a pleasing personality. Personal power is usually not as effective as the other forms of power.\nSymbolic power is based on the power that comes from being associated with important symbols. Symbolic power can make the power holder seem more important to others.\nCoercive power is based on the power to punish or harm others. Coercive power is usually not available to people in consulting relationships."}

One such theory is Baltes's Selective Optimization with Compensation theory. According to this theory, as people age, they continue to optimize their development. However, they do so in a selective way, meaning that they focus on some areas of development while allowing other areas to decline. This process of selective optimization involves two types of compensation. The first is a upward compensation, in which people increase their investment in positive experiences in order to compensate for the decline of abilities. The second is a downward compensation, in which people decrease their investment in negative experiences in order to compensate for the decline of abilities.\nAnother theory of aging is Lachman and Lutz's lifespan theory. According to this theory, development can be described as a process of growth (gain) and decline (loss). This process begins at birth and continues throughout life. Some abilities, such as riding a bicycle, are gained during childhood and are then maintained throughout life. Other abilities, such as hearing, are lost during childhood and are then maintained throughout life."}

Experimental designs have types of variables.\nThe type of a variable is called its category. Experimental categories are:\nIndependent variable. This is the variable that is different or changed.\nDependent variable. This is the variable that is measured or observed.\nThere are two kinds of dependent variables:\nCategorical. These depend on the experimental category.\nContinuous. These are numbers.\nA t test is a statistical test that can be used to compare the means of two groups. A t test assumes that the data are continuous and that the two groups are independent.\nA two-sample t test can be used to compare the means of two groups. A two-sample t test assumes that the data are continuous and that the two groups are independent.\nA one-sample t test can be used to compare the mean of a group to a known value.

This conclusion is valid if the paired two-sample t test comparing severely disturbed patients with less severely disturbed patients is significant.\nThe experimenter fails to take into account regression toward the mean. Regression toward the mean is the tendency for extreme values to be less extreme when measured a second time. This tendency can make the improvement in the most severely disturbed patients less extreme than it initially appeared. So, the improvement in the most severely disturbed patients may not be as much as the experimenter thinks.\nThe experimenter also fails to take into consideration historical and maturational variables.

Some behaviors, such as riding a bicycle, are acquired by learning. Other behaviors, such as hearing, are acquired by stimulation. But how do infants acquire language, which is not present in the environment?\nIn the 1950 s and 1960 s, researchers conducted a series of studies to answer this question. One of the researchers who made important contributions to this field is Konrad Lorenz. Lorenz's research on imprinting led to the search for a sensitive period for social referencing in human infants.\nA sensitive period for social referencing means that infants prefer to use social cues (like looking at their caregiver when they hear a noise) during the first year of life.\nThese findings suggest that there is a critical period for attachment. In other words, if infants do not form a secure attachment to their caregivers during the first year of life, they may have difficulty forming attachments later in life."}

{"question": "One of the key areas of debate in the early stages of Developmental Psychology was the so called, Nature vs. Nurture debate. Academics agreed that there was interaction between these two factors but there was wide disagreement concerning the degree of interaction. Which of the following terms, that relate to either genetic or environmentally caused changes, describes the differences in timing of physical changes that are found in children belonging to different cohorts?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sensitive period."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Secular trends."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Canalization?"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Critical period."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Genetics and the environment interact to influence every aspect of an organism's behavior, including its behavior in the social world. In fact, it is unlikely that any two individuals, even monozygotic twins, are exact genetic copies. Some of this individual difference is due to environmental effects on genes, which are now being studied in detail.\nChildren develop in a environment that includes the events that are happening in the world around them. Some of these events affect genes, and some do not. For example, aging is caused by the environment, but it affects genes, because aging behaviors are passed down from parents to offspring. Likewise, exposure to toxins in the environment can cause permanent changes in genes.\nCanalization is a term that is used to describe the way in which genes can cause similar responses in different organisms. For example, a sugar level of 120 mg/dL may cause a response in one person, but a sugar level of 200 mg/dL may be required to cause the same response in another person. Canalization helps to make responses to the environment more consistent from person to person.\nA critical period is a period of time during which certain experiences are particularly important for the development of certain behaviors. For example, some scientists believe that being raised in a language-rich environment is important for language development. If children do not have much experience with language during the critical period, they may have difficulty learning language as well as children who are raised in language-rich environments.\nA sensitive period is a period of time during which certain experiences are necessary for the development of certain behaviors. For example, between 2 and 7 years of age, children's brains are sensitive to language. If children do not have much experience with language during this time, they may have difficulty learning language as well as children who are exposed to language during this time.\nSecular trends are long-term patterns of change in behavior that are not tied to any particular developmental period. These patterns can be tied to changes in the environment, such as changes in what people eat."}

There are several different ways that learning can occur.\nImmediate reward is a common way that learning can occur. When people have food placed in their mouths soon after banging their spoons on their high chairs, for example, they learn that banging spoons produces food. This type of learning is called operant conditioning.\nMediated generalization is a type of operant conditioning. It occurs when a person learns to associate a behavior with a specific outcome, and then generalizes that association to similar situations. For example, a person might learn that shouting makes a loud noise. Later, that person may generalize this association to other situations and shout in an attempt to make a loud noise.\nHigher-order conditioning is a type of learning that involves learning to associate two specific stimuli. A famous experiment involving a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) involved dogs that salivated when exposed to meat smoke. Over time, the dogs learned to associate the meat smoke with the arrival of food. Later, the dogs salivated in response to the meat smoke, even when no food was present.\nLatent learning is another type of learning. It can be observed when a person gets up from a chair and walks out of a room. Walking out of a room is a behavior that a person can learn by watching others.\nResponse shaping is a type of operant conditioning. It involves manipulating a behavior by adding a small reward. For example, a person may be hesitant to ask for help. By adding a small reward, such as a verbal praise, the person's behavior is shaped into a more helpful behavior.\nSOLUTION: Anxiety induced by reading about an automobile accident some months after having had such an accident can be best described as an instance of mediated generalization. This type of learning involves learning to associate a behavior with a specific outcome, and then generalizing that association to similar situations. Anxiety is the response that results from reading about an automobile accident. The person generalizes the anxiety-inducing outcome to other situations that are similar in some way to the first accident."}

Deception is not used when the research could be done honestly.\nImagine that you want to find out if college students accept a research invitation by email. You could do the study in one of two ways.\nThe first way is to ask the students directly if they would accept such an invitation. This is the most honest approach, and it would be the best way to do the study if the students could predict their own reactions.\nThe second way is to wait for an email invitation to a study to show up in the students' inboxes.

In the context of a campaign, inoculation involves warning people about the negative consequences of supporting the opposing candidate. For example, if candidate advertisements are expected, an inoculation message could explain that the opposing candidate is not as successful as he seems.\nInoculation is most effective when the refutations are weak. So, if the candidate is not as successful as he seems, a weak refutation could be that he is still relatively successful.\nAn effective inoculation message can make people more resistant to persuasive messages. For example, if people are inoculated with weak refutations to the idea that the candidate is a successful businessman, they are likely to be more resistant to a campaign by the opponent that claims the candidate is a wealthy entrepreneur.\nSOLUTION: To inoculate someone against a persuasive message, you would provide the person with arguments against her beliefs and weak refutations of those arguments. This will make the person more resistant to persuasive messages.\nFor example, if a person believes that it is acceptable to eat meat from animals that are not treated with hormones and antibiotics, an inoculation message could present arguments against that belief. Then, the message could provide weak refutations of those arguments. For example, a weak refutation could be that even meat from animals treated with hormones and antibiotics is safe to eat."}

They view the family as a complex system in which each member is affected by and affects the others.\nFamily therapists also seek to understand the patterns of interaction between family members. They look for ways in which these patterns may be contributing to the presenting problem.\nFamily therapy is typically used for short-term treatment of specific problems. It is a highly effective approach when the presenting problem is clearly defined and when the family is willing to work together to solve the problem.\nThere are many different ways of doing family therapy. One way is to help family members explore and identify the negative patterns of interaction that are contributing to the presenting problem. Then, the family therapist can help the family members try out new ways of interacting.\nAnother way of doing family therapy is to focus on the relationships between family members. The family therapist will help family members discuss their relationships and how these relationships are affecting the presenting problem.\nA family therapist will not take the side of one family member against another.

How might an experience change from being beneficial to harmful if it occurs at the wrong time? For example, think about an important step in human development called language acquisition. Some scientists believe that children's brains are wired to learn language at a certain time period. If a child does not learn language during that time period, it may be more difficult for the child to learn later on. In other words, the timing of language acquisition may be a sensitive or critical period.\nSOLUTION: The concept of sensitive or critical periods involves the timing of an environmental experience. During sensitive or critical periods, an experience that does not occur during a certain time period may have lasting effects on development. These effects may be positive or negative. For example, not being exposed to language during a sensitive period as an infant may result in difficulty with language acquisition later on. But being exposed to music during a sensitive period as a child may result in greater musical ability later on.\nDiscontinuity involves the idea that a change in an environmental experience can change the course of development. For example, think about what happens when a baby crawls. Crawling is a new experience that marks a change in the way a baby experiences the world. Crawling may change the way a baby's brain develops.\nRisk and resilience involves the idea that the environment can place children at greater risk for certain outcomes. For example, think about how being exposed to lead can increase the risk of developmental problems. But being resilient can also play a role in human development. Being resilient means being able to recover from negative experiences.\nThe idea that individuals may have different possible developmental trajectories, given the timing of an environmental experience or lack thereof, is the concept of sensitive or critical periods."}

But judgments about trustworthiness based on statistical data, such as the person's income or zip code, are more accurate.\nDoesn't take base rate data into account.\nThe base rate of a phenomenon is the rate at which it occurs in the population. The representativeness heuristic doesn't take base rate data into account, which can lead to overconfidence in your judgments.\nFor example, if a stereotypical representative of a group is a gambler, you might judge that a member of the group is a gambler. But not all members of the group are gamblers.\nOverestimates the degree to which dispositional factors affect behavior.\nThe representativeness heuristic can lead you to overestimate the degree to which dispositional factors, such as traits of the individual, affect behavior.\nFor example, if a person is a smoker, you might judge that the person is irresponsible.

An artist's drawing may include details not shown in other types of graphs or charts.\nA mandala is a geometric shape that represents the world or the self. A mandala often uses circles or squares.\nA life staircase is a graph that shows the stages of life as a series of steps. Each step shows a stage of life, and arrows show the progression from step to step.\nA life rainbow is a graph that shows the stages of life as a series of colors. Each color shows a stage of life, and arrows show the progression from color to color.\nAn octagon is a geometric shape with eight sides.

They work in a variety of settings, including private practice, community mental health centers, and hospitals. As part of their work, psychologists must comply with ethical standards.\nOne set of ethical standards is followed by psychologists who are members of the American Psychological Association. These standards include rules about dual relationships, confidentiality, and the types of therapy that psychologists may provide.\nA dual relationship occurs when a psychologist has multiple roles in a patient's life. For example, a psychologist may be a therapist to a patient and may also be the patient's supervisor at work. Dual relationships can lead to conflicts of interest and can harm the patient.\nFor example, if a psychologist is the supervisor of an intern, the psychologist may have knowledge of the intern's work performance. This information could be used to harm the intern if the psychologist chooses to divulge it.\nPsychologists must avoid dual relationships.\nConfidentiality involves keeping patient information private. Patients must be able to trust that their psychologist will not share information with others.\nPsychologists must protect the confidentiality of patient information. There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, psychologists may disclose information to protect the safety of others.\nSOLUTION: The psychologist has acted ethically because the intern is in desperate need of help. The psychologist has agreed to provide therapy to the intern.\nThe psychologist has not violated the intern's right to privacy. The psychologist has not disclosed information about the intern to others.\nThe psychologist has not entered into a dual relationship.

Attachment patterns are formed during childhood.\nResearch has shown that there are four main attachment patterns.\nThese attachment patterns are most associated with these types of child abuse and neglect:\nNeglect is most associated with disorganized/disoriented and distant/disengaged attachments. These children are seen as low in behavioral and emotional reactivity.\nAbuse is most associated with insecure/ambivalent and insecure/avoidant attachments. These children are seen as high in behavioral and emotional reactivity.\nOrganisms have an innate desire to form attachments. This desire is called attachment motivation.\nAttachment motivation affects how people behave when they are interacting with others. It also affects how people feel when they are not with others.\nAttachment behaviors are ways that people act to get attention, support, or protection from others. These behaviors are caused by attachment motivation.\nAttachment motivation and attachment behaviors can change as a person grows and develops. These changes are not necessarily linked to childhood experiences.\nSOLUTION: The four attachment patterns are organized as a continuum, with secure attachment at one end and disorganized/disoriented attachment at the other end.\nThe other attachment patterns are insecure/ambivalent, insecure/avoidant, and distant/disengaged.\nDisorganized/disoriented attachment is the most associated with child abuse and neglect. This pattern is characterized by an absence of a cohesive self-identity and an inability to regulate behavior and emotions.\nDistant/disengaged attachment is characterized by a lack of behavioral and emotional responsiveness.\nInsecure/ambivalent attachment is characterized by a mix of clinging and avoidance.\nInsecure/avoidant attachment is characterized by a lack of behavioral and emotional responsiveness."}
