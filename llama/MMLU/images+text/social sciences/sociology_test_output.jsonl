For example, surveillance cameras and tracking tools can be used to monitor people's movements and activities.\nSOLUTION: Access and exchange 'private' information about consumers is a type of surveillance.\nCompanies and other organizations can use surveillance to collect information about individuals, including information that is considered private. They can then use this information to sell goods and services to people who are most likely to want or need them.\nMonitor employees' activities at work is a type of surveillance.\nEmployers may use surveillance to monitor employees' behavior at work. For example, employers may use surveillance cameras to monitor employees' activities or to check that employees are following safety procedures.\nReduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging is a type of surveillance.\nElectronic tagging involves using technology to track the movements of people who have been released from prison.

Social institutions influence how individuals live their lives, what choices they make, and how these choices affect their lives.\nInstitutions are made up of rules and regulations that are enforced by the government. These rules govern different aspects of society, such as the economy, politics, and religion. So, social institutions are interrelated sets of social practices.\nBecause social institutions are interrelated, changes in one institution can affect other institutions. For example, changes in the economy can affect politics and vice versa.\nSocieties cannot function without social institutions. Institutions provide a framework for social life.

They are formed when people begin to cooperate and find that they need to make rules and assign roles.\nFamilies, for example, are institutions that structure family interactions. In a family, parents and children have roles, and there are rules about how they will interact.\nInstitutions can influence the behavior of individuals who are not part of the institution. For example, the institution of the family makes it easier for family members to cooperate and to help one another. But institutions can also constrain the behavior of individuals. For example, the institution of the workplace may make it harder for workers to organize.\nSOLUTION: The nuclear family is an institution that structures family interactions. It involves a husband, a wife, and their children living together in their own home.\nStone's research suggests that the nuclear family did not exist in any form before industrialization. Instead, families were larger and more extended. Parents were not the main sources of emotional support for children.\nSo, prior to industrialization, the nuclear family: had not yet been formed. It had begun to disappear, as extended networks of kin became more important."}

In society, some types of capital are more valuable than others. For example, wealth is a form of capital, but not all wealth is created equal. Money that is inherited or won in a sweepstakes is not as valuable as money that is earned. In the field of sociology, there are several types of capital that are considered valuable:\nSocial capital is the network of relationships among people who live or work in the same community. Social capital includes the trust, norms, and networks that make social life work.\nCultural capital is the knowledge, skills, and styles that are valued by a society. Cultural capital includes the ability to appreciate art, music, and literature, to speak more than one language, and to understand the social rules that govern behavior.\nHuman capital is the knowledge, skills, and health that individuals have. Human capital includes the ability to learn, as well as the health and well-being of the individual.\nEconomic capital is the wealth that individuals or groups have. Economic capital includes money, property, and other material resources.\nBourdieu, a French sociologist, argued that cultural capital is essential to the reproduction of class. Class is a powerful social institution that organizes people into groups with similar social, economic, and cultural capital. In societies with class, the types of capital that are most valuable are also the types of capital that are most likely to be passed down through families.\nSOLUTION: To reproduce class, families must pass down cultural capital to their children. Parents can pass down cultural capital by teaching their children the things that are valued by the class to which they belong. These things include knowledge, skills, and styles that are difficult to learn. For example, learning to speak the language of the leisured class is difficult, but it is also a signal that one is a member of the leisured class. By passing down cultural capital, families reproduce their class."}

Traditional authority is based on the obedience of subjects to a leader.\nThe development of a traditional authority legitimated the state's use of force by defining the state as a traditional authority.\nCharismatic authority is the idea that people should follow a leader who has a charism, or a special gift.\nThe development of a charismatic authority legitimated the state's use of force by defining the state as a charismatic authority.\nA value-rational authority is an authority that is based on shared values.\nThe appeal to a higher values or ideals legitimated the state's use of force by defining the state as a value-rational authority.\nRational-legal authority is an authority that is based on the rules of a system.\nThe development of a rational-legal authority legitimated the state's use of force by defining the state as a rational-legal authority."}

Durkheim saw sociology as a social science that would explore how social facts (things like laws and political institutions) could be studied scientifically.\nDurkheim divided the study of social facts into two major types of systems:\nA social fact is a feature of society that appears as a result of the external rules and regulations that govern a group. Some social facts are positive, such as laws and regulations. Other social facts are negative, such as punishment.\nA social group is a group of people who interact with each other. Some social groups are based on shared interests, such as sports teams or book clubs. Other social groups are based on social status, such as family or race.\nDurkheim believed that sociology could improve people's lives by making social facts more transparent. Durkheim thought that by studying how social facts related to each other, sociologists could help improve laws, business practices, and other social institutions."}
{"question": "The term \"sociology\" was coined in the early 1800s by which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Auguste Comte"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Robert K. Merton"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Karl Marx"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Emile Durkheim"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In order to understand the development of sociology as a discipline, it is first necessary to place it within the context of the broader intellectual tradition of its time.\nBefore the 1800s, there was no distinct field of study called sociology. Instead, many of the central ideas of sociology were developed by philosophers and social theorists.\nAuguste Comte is able to be called the father of sociology because he was the first person to propose that sociology should be a specific academic discipline. In 1838, he published the first volume of a work called Cours de philosophie positive (Course in Positive Philosophy). In this work, Comte argued that the social world was a proper object of scientific inquiry and that a new scientific discipline was necessary to study it.\nRobert Merton, a sociologist in the mid-1900 s, traced the development of sociology from Comte's ideas. He argued that during the 1800 s, three main approaches to studying society emerged.\nThe most influential of these was the positivist approach, which was developed by Comte and others. Positivists believed that society could be studied in the same way as the natural world. They believed that by observing and collecting data, sociologists could uncover the laws that govern society.\nThe interpretivist approach, which was influenced by the work of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, emphasized the importance of understanding the subjective experiences of individuals.\nThe sociology of knowledge, which was influenced by the philosophers Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend, examined the ways in which knowledge is created and used in society.\nSOLUTION: Auguste Comte was the first person to use the term sociology. He coined the term in the early 1800 s, and his work laid the foundation for the development of sociology as a specific academic discipline."}

Fieldwork involves living in a community and observing its members. Anthropologists also talk to members of the community to learn about their ideas and values.\nBecause anthropologists come from different cultures, they may have different reactions to the ways of life they observe. For example, an anthropologist from a culture that values direct communication may interpret ordinary conversation in a different society as polite or rude. An anthropologist from a culture that values silence may interpret ordinary silence in a different society as a sign of respect or as a lack of interest.\nAnthropologists are aware that their values affect their observations. So, they make every effort to understand the values of the community they are studying. This helps anthropologists identify the assumptions and values that are shared by their host society and their own society.\nBy comparing these shared assumptions and values, anthropologists can identify the ways in which the societies are the same and different.

For example, it may make it harder to get a loan or to get into a good college.\nSome people may change their behavior in order to avoid being labeled as deviant. Others may accept their deviant label and try to change society's behavior toward them.\nSOLUTION: Secondary deviation is what happens as a result of being labeled as deviant."}

These theories are used to understand how people act alone or in groups. Theories such as social norms, conformity, and normative social influence describe how people are influenced by others. Other theories, such as the value-added and emergent-norm theories, describe how people help others.\nValue-added theory: This theory explains altruism, or helping others, as a value added to the actor's own contribution. For example, a person may decide that the value of the help they provide others is greater than the value of the help they receive in return.\nEmergent-norm theory: This theory explains altruism as a type of norm, or rule, that emerges from the situation and influences the actor's behavior. For example, in a situation where many people stop to help, the act of helping may become a expected and required behavior.\nContagion theory: This theory explains altruism as a result of a contagious behavior. For example, seeing someone help may cause another person to help.\nConvergence theory: This theory explains altruism as a result of people changing their behavior to match that of others. For example, seeing someone help may cause another person to help."}

Many people have moved from the countryside to cities. The major cities have also grown in size.\nAs a result of these trends, suburbanization has developed. This is the process by which people move into suburbs or other outlying areas. The suburbs often surround the city. Many people drive cars to work.\nSOLUTION: A new highway makes it easier to commute from the farmland to the city. This will likely lead to development of the farmland. The city will evolve into a multiple nuclei model. In this model, there are several smaller cities around a larger one.\nSuburbanization will develop because the time it takes to commute to the city has been decreased. This makes it more convenient to live in the countryside and commute to the city.\nPeople from the countryside will move to the city, depopulating the farmland region. This happens because the farmland is now easier to access from the city.\nFarmers will increase the acreage under production. With the new highway, farmers can more easily reach their land. So, they may decide to plant more crops."}

Some occupational categories are high-status, and others are low-status.\nIntergenerational mobility refers to the movement between occupational categories between generations.

Some of the people who do not return the questionnaire may have responded differently than the people who returned it.\nThe response rate tells you what percentage of people sent questionnaires actually returned them. A response rate of 0.7 means that 7 out of every 10 people sent questionnaires returned them.\nA response rate bias occurs when the responses from the people who returned the questionnaires are not representative of the responses from the entire population.\nA response rate that is too low may introduce a response rate bias. But if the response rate is 0.7 or higher, the results are not likely contaminated by response rate bias.\nA researcher bias occurs when the researcher conducting the study has an interest in a certain outcome.\nFor example, if a researcher is paid by a company to conduct a study that will help the company, the researcher may be biased in favor of the company.\nConfusing correlation with causation is the bias that results from assuming that because two things happened together, one caused the other.\nFor example, it may be assumed that eating ice cream causes more people to go to the beach. However, the real cause may be that people who go to the beach like to eat ice cream.\nStatistical regression is the expected change in the mean score of a variable caused by a change in the mean score of another variable.\nFor example, the score of the variable weight is expected to decrease when the score of the variable age increases.\nResults based only on the returned questionnaires are most likely contaminated by response rate bias.\nThe response rate was 0.7, so the response rate bias was not present in the study."}

These roles can include both norms (rules for behavior that are considered appropriate by a group of people) and statuses (the positions that people hold within a group).\nRole-learning theory suggests that people learn their social roles in one of two ways: by internalizing pre-existing roles from a community of others or by creating and negotiating their roles through interaction with others.\nRoles have to be learned. We do not come into the world with an inherited set of social roles. Instead, we learn these roles as we interact with others.\nSocial roles are not fixed or stable, but they are also not fluid and pluralistic. It is not the case that anyone can do anything in any situation. People do have to follow the rules of their social roles.\nSOLUTION: According to role-learning theory, we create and negotiate our roles through interaction with others.\nOther people are not in the same social roles as we are.

Today, the term is used to describe the practice of unfairly blaming one person or group for the problems of a community.\nWhen you scapegoat a person or group, you hold them responsible for the problems of a community. But it is not fair to blame them for these problems.\nSOLUTION: Scapegoating involves unjustly accusing a person or group of problems. If one group is always blamed for the problems of a society, it is an ethnocentric society. Institutionalization happens when a society makes customs and traditions out of practices. So, institutionalization can occur when a society scapegoats a group. But scapegoating is not the same as stereotyping. You can stereotype a group without scapegoating them. And scapegoating does not necessarily mean that a practice is institutionalized."}

When an author paraphrases, they restate a concept or idea from the text in different words. When an author outlines, they set up the structure of a text and evaluate the ideas in that text.\nSreberny-Mohammadi outlines three strategies that national cultures can use to resist American cultural domination of the media. She argues that these strategies can help maintain distinct cultures and prevent the homogenization of cultures.\nDomesticating its content involves creating media products that reflect the values and beliefs of the national culture. This can help ensure that the media more accurately represents the culture.\nControlling the distribution of imported products is a strategy that involves limiting access to foreign media. This can help prevent the displacement of national media by foreign media.\nCreating \"reverse flows\" of their own programs back to imperial societies involves using media to challenge the cultural dominance of the imperial society. This can help reduce the cultural dominance of the imperial society."}

He said that when he studied a class, he tried to identify how that class defined itself in relation to other social classes.\nMarx divided the classes into two groups: the ruling class and the subject class. The ruling class is the group that rules. The subject class is the group that is ruled.\nMarx believed that the working class was the subject class.

It is the minimum income deemed adequate for a person or family to achieve a certain standard of living. The poverty line is set each year by the Department of Commerce.\nThe poverty line is determined by the government's calculation of the minimum income needed for basic needs. The calculation takes into account the income needs of both individuals and families. The poverty line is adjusted each year for inflation.\nThe poverty line is based on the concept of relative deprivation. This means that people who are poor are those who have a lower income than others in society. So, the poverty line varies over time as incomes in society change.\nSOLUTION: The United States government uses the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to determine the poverty line. The OMB considers the income needs of both individuals and families. The poverty line is adjusted each year for inflation.\nThe OMB does not include the value of government services, such as Medicaid or public housing, when setting the poverty line."}

Sexual behaviors in particular have varied widely over time and across cultures.\nBut it is important to note that the stories people tell about their sexual experiences and behaviors are always subject to interpretation. Different people will interpret different behaviors as sexual, and will make sense of those behaviors in different ways.\nFor example, during the 1970 s, a sexual revolution took place in the United States. Some people began to question traditional attitudes about sexual behavior, and new sexual behaviors became more widely accepted. But even these new behaviors were not equally accepted by all people. And even today, there is still debate about what is and is not acceptable sexual behavior.\nSOLUTION: Homosexuality was not understood as a positive identity in which gay people could take pride until the 20 th century.\nBefore the 20 th century, homosexuality was generally understood as an absolute taboo. For example, in ancient Greece, homosexuality was punishable by death.\nEven in the 20 th century, homosexuality was a subordinate form of masculinity that threatened \"compulsory heterosexuality.\" In other words, even after homosexuality was no longer an absolute taboo, it was still not considered a positive identity.\nHomosexuality was confirmation of the two-sex model. In other words, homosexuality was not considered a third sex. Instead, it was seen as a pattern of attraction that conformed to a traditional notion of sex."}

There are usually fewer people in this group than in the middle age groups.\nThe middle of the pyramid represents the largest age groups. These people are typically in their 20s, 30s, or 40s.\nThe bottom of the pyramid represents the youngest age group. These people are typically in their 10s or 20s.\nThe panels on the left and right of the pyramid show the number of males and females in each age group, respectively.\nSOLUTION: A population that has had a slightly larger birth rate than death rate for several generations will have a wider pyramid at the top than in the middle.

The terms used to justify racist policies have changed, but the ideas remain the same. For example, the U.S. government's policies today are no less racist because they are called \"the war on drugs\" rather than \"segregation.\"\nThe term \"racism\" was coined in the 1800 s. It was first used to describe the ideology of the French aristocrat, Count Gobineau, who believed that people could be classified into races, and that some races were superior to others.\nIn the 1900 s, the Nazi Party in Germany used Gobineau's ideas to justify their racist policies of exclusion and violence. The Nazis believed that Jews were a race and that they were inferior to the so-called Aryan race.\nToday, some people use the term \"racism\" to describe prejudice and discrimination against people of different races. Other people use the term \"racism\" to describe ideas that are considered racist."}

Women and members of certain racial and ethnic groups are often affected by glass ceilings.\nGender constancy: Gender constancy is the idea that people have a fixed idea of what is appropriate behavior for males and females.
