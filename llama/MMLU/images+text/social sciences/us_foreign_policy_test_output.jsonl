The Nixon administration marked a turn away from the internationalist perspective that had dominated U.S. foreign policy since the end of World War II. The new foreign policy was a response to the domestic and international upheavals of the 1960 s, including the Vietnam War, the anti-war movement, and the cultural and political changes known as the counterculture.\nThe Nixon administration's new foreign policy was based on the idea of limited government and individual liberty. It turned away from the idea of global activism, in which the United States takes an aggressive role in promoting democracy and free trade around the world. Instead, it emphasized the need to maintain a strong national defense and to use American military power when necessary.\nThe new foreign policy was also influenced by a strand of populist sentiment. Populism is a political philosophy that emphasizes the concerns of ordinary people. It is opposed to elites, whether they are political, economic, or cultural.\nIn foreign policy, populism can take different forms. It can be an expression of American cultural superiority, a belief that the United States is morally and culturally superior to other nations. It can also be a rejection of international institutions and agreements, which are seen as having negative effects on the American economy.\nThe correct answer is D. Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making reflects a populist sentiment. It involves taking into account the concerns of ordinary people. It is an expression of populism that is internationalist in orientation, not isolationist."}

One such set of theories is known as the systemic perspectives.\nThere are four major factors, or variables, that according to systemic perspectives determine a state's foreign policy: the character of a state's leader, the distribution of power in the international system, the distribution of power within a state's governmental system, and a state's political ideology.\nA state's foreign policy is primarily determined by the distribution of power in the international system, according to systemic theories. These theories argue that a state's foreign policy is largely shaped by the distribution of power among states. Because power is the central concern of states, a state's foreign policy is largely determined by which other states are considered powerful.\nA state's foreign policy is also determined by the character of a state's leader, according to systemic theories. The personal characteristics of a state's leader can shape that state's foreign policy. For example, a leader who is more aggressive might be more likely to use military force as a part of the state's foreign policy.\nThe distribution of power within a state's governmental system does not significantly affect a state's foreign policy, according to systemic theories. This variable refers to the distribution of power within a state's government. According to these theories, a state's foreign policy is not significantly affected by which government branches or officials hold power.\nA state's political ideology does not significantly affect a state's foreign policy, according to systemic theories. This variable refers to a state's political beliefs. According to these theories, a state's foreign policy is not significantly affected by the state's political ideology."}

It can create jobs and raise living standards by focusing on the production of goods and services that a country excels at producing. This is known as comparative advantage.\nCountries trade with each other in order to get goods and services that are not available domestically. For example, a country with plenty of food may trade with a country with plenty of clothing.\nHowever, not all countries trade with each other. Some countries may have few goods or services to offer, or other countries may have an advantage in producing those goods or services.\nCountries may also limit trade with each other for a variety of reasons, such as political tension, fear of disease, or concerns about the environment.\nSOLUTION: Countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market for a variety of reasons.\nOne reason is that costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed. Free trade means trading with other countries. Firms that benefit from free trade may be located in a different country, while firms that are hurt by free trade may be located in the same country as the consumers who are hurt.\nAnother reason is that regime type matters. Democracies are more likely to engage in international trade. Autocratic regimes are more likely to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market.\nProtectionism, or the desire to protect domestic firms from competition, can also stem from regime type.\nFinally, international conflict can prevent trade. Countries that are at war or in a state of heightened tension may not trade with each other."}

As states formed, they could no longer rely on customary law or legal norms to protect their security. The state needed a way to protect itself from other states, which were now the primary security threat.\nTwo basic types of institutions emerged to address these security concerns. The first were institutions that made aggression less likely, such as treaties and diplomacy. The second were institutions that made aggression more costly, such as military alliances and security pacts.\nThe institutional approaches to war are not mutually exclusive. For example, a security pact can make aggression more costly, and diplomacy can make aggression less likely.\nThe institutional approach to anarchy is to use international institutions to constrain the actions of states. Anarchy is the absence of a central authority to govern the international system. In the absence of a central authority, international institutions can help to create a set of rules and norms that states follow.\nInternational institutions can help to coordinate the actions of states. For example, international institutions can help to ensure that states follow a set of rules and norms. This coordination can help to solve collective action problems.\nSOLUTION: International institutions are designed to address problems of collective action and coordination. These problems can arise when states attempt to coordinate their policies. Coordination allows states to act in concert on issues of mutual concern.\nInternational institutions can help to achieve cooperation by making coordination more easy or by making noncooperation more difficult. For example, international institutions can make cooperation more easy by providing a set of rules that states follow. This set of rules can help to remove uncertainty and can make cooperation more attractive.\nInternational institutions are also designed to address the problem of war. By making war more costly, international institutions can help to reduce the frequency and severity of war."}

The finances increased because the country collected more taxes than it spent. The military capability increased because the country invested in new weapons and tactics. The international influence increased because the country gained trust and respect from other countries.\nSOLUTION: The term American multiplication table most likely means increase in the US population.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, schools in the United States used multiplication tables to teach children basic mathematics.

They can be general plans of action that cover a broad range of issues or more specific plans that address a single issue.\nA grand strategy can be as simple or complex as a country needs it to be. It may include a few broad principles or a long list of specific policy proposals. It may focus on economic or military issues, or it may seek to integrate the two. It may emphasize the use of force or the promotion of diplomacy.\nFor example, a grand strategy of offshore balancing would identify the mainland United States as the country's central interest and would seek to protect it through a military and diplomatic strategy that involves keeping other countries in the Pacific and Europe strong enough to deter aggression but not so strong as to be a threat to the United States.\nAn isolationist grand strategy would identify the mainland United States as the country's central interest and would seek to protect it by disengaging from the international system as much as possible.\nA realist grand strategy would identify the mainland United States as the country's central interest and would seek to protect it through a military and diplomatic strategy that involves alliances with other countries as well as a strong military.\nA liberal grand strategy would identify the mainland United States as the country's central interest and would seek to protect it through a military and diplomatic strategy that involves multilateral institutions and cooperation with other countries.\nSOLUTION: A grand strategy of offshore balancing would include the following policies:\nMaintaining a balance between the United States and other countries and not entering into alliances.\nEmbrace multi-polarity, show greater restraint internationally and require other states to meet their own security burdens.\nIsolate the US from the international system and not seek global power.\nThese policies are part of a grand strategy of offshore balancing because they focus on maintaining a balance of power among multiple states, not entering into alliances, and not seeking global power."}

In the past, many countries provided foreign aid for altruistic (selfless) reasons. Today, foreign aid is also seen as a way to promote a country's interests. For example, providing aid to a country can help a country gain influence with that country, get access to that country's resources, or gain a trading partner.\nThe effect of foreign aid on a recipient country is not always clear. Some economists believe that foreign aid can help a recipient country grow. But foreign aid has also been known to have negative effects. For example, foreign aid can create dependency on aid, lead to expensive and inefficient investments, and undermine a recipient country's incentive to collect taxes.\nSOLUTION: The most effective way to disburse foreign aid to encourage change in a target state is through conditional programs. These programs, such as the Millennium Challenge, require the recipient country to demonstrate its commitment to certain reforms before receiving aid. Conditional programs have been successful in promoting policy changes in target states."}

There are three major categories of nuclear weapons states: United States, Russia/Soviet Union, and United Kingdom.\nFor the United States and Russia/Soviet Union, the most reliable predictor of whether a state becomes a nuclear weapons state is reception of sensitive nuclear assistance. These states see another state receiving help with its nuclear program and decide to build their own nuclear weapons.\nFor the United Kingdom, the most reliable predictor is being a colonial power. The United Kingdom had nuclear weapons at a time when it was a major colonial power.\nFor these three types of nuclear weapons states, regime type is also a good predictor. Democracies are much less likely to be nuclear weapons states than autocracies.\nWealth/GDP is not a good predictor of which states will get nuclear weapons. Both South Korea and Iran have high GDPs, but only North Korea has nuclear weapons."}
