In science, scientists use the term \"predisposition\" to describe the idea that some things are caused by other things. For example, a seed's predisposition to grow might be due to its genes, or the temperature and amount of water it is exposed to.\nUnderstanding how things are predisposed to change can help predict how they will change in the future. If farmers know that a certain type of seed has a predisposition to grow well in wet soil, they can use this predictive information to decide which seeds to plant.\nSome things are predisposed to change in response to other things. These are called motives. Motives are the desires and needs that guide a person's behavior. They influence what a person chooses to do.\nSome motives are more imperative to survival than others. This means that if the needs associated with these motives are not met, a person is likely to have difficulty surviving. Food and water are more imperative to survival than a desire to listen to a certain type of music.\nOther motives are less imperative to survival. These needs can be met without necessarily ensuring a person's survival. For example, the need for self-actualization, the desire to achieve one's full potential, is less imperative to survival than the need for food."}

One type of data is universal screening data, which shows how well students are meeting competencies that are essential for success in school and life.\nWhen universal screening data show that very few students are successfully meeting school competencies, it is important to do the following:\n1. Change the way the core program is delivered.\nThe core program is the set of classes that all students take. For example, if the data show that a large number of students are not successfully meeting the competencies in English/Language Arts, changes in the delivery of the core program may be needed.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: A fetus with the genotype XXY will most likely suffer from sterility as an adult. These fetuses have a genotype of XXY for the sex chromosomes. Most animals have a genotype of XY or XX for their sex chromosomes. An organism with a genotype of XXY does not have a combination of sex chromosomes that is usually found in animals. This can cause problems with the organism's reproductive system."}

The ability to use language, for example, has been shown to improve during maturation periods.\nCritical periods are shorter periods during which the brain is especially sensitive to certain types of stimulation. If a critical period is missed, the ability to learn a certain skill may be permanently reduced.\nFor example, if a child does not learn to talk until she is late in her teens, her ability to speak may be permanently impaired.\nPrimary and secondary development periods are types of critical periods.\nDuring primary critical periods, the absence of a stimulation will permanently reduce the ability to learn a skill.\nFor example, a critical period for language acquisition occurs during the first few years of life. If a child does not hear language during this time, she may not be able to learn to talk.\nDuring secondary critical periods, the absence of a stimulation may not permanently reduce the ability to learn a skill.\nFor example, a child who does not learn to read during the critical period for language acquisition may not be able to learn to read as easily.

Skinner. Behaviorism is a position in psychology that focuses on observable behavior and claims that behavior can be studied without examining the mind.\nBehavior is the result of competing motives that result from mental events that occur outside of one's awareness.\nThis view is too judgmental. It suggests that behaviorism is concerned with unconscious motivations that are always present. However, classical behaviorism does not necessarily believe that these motivations are always present.\nBehavior is under the control of external stimuli that either reinforce or punish actions, thereby affecting the likelihood of the occurrence of these behaviors.\nThis view is most closely matched to classical behaviorism. It suggests that behavior is controlled by the environment and that internal motivations are not necessary for behavior to occur.\nBehavior can be controlled by introspection.\nThis view is too judgmental. It suggests that behaviorism is concerned with controlling behavior by examining the mind. However, classical behaviorism does not necessarily believe that behavior can be controlled in this way.\nInternal drives and motivation are the causes of behavior.\nThis view is most strongly opposed to classical behaviorism.

A consultation model is a pattern of behavior that a school psychologist uses when working with teachers or other educators. These patterns can include the problems that the school psychologist tries to solve, the activities that the school psychologist engages in, and the relationships that the school psychologist establishes.\nThere are many different consultation models. Five types of consultation models are:\nResource,\nAdaptive learning environments,\nTriadic,\nSystems, and\nFamily and community involvement.\nThe consultation model a school psychologist uses affects the problems that the school psychologist tries to solve. Different consultation models focus on different types of problems.\nFor example, a resource consultation model involves the school psychologist providing teachers with information about academic topics. A triadic consultation model involves the school psychologist working with the teacher and student directly. A systems consultation model involves the school psychologist working with the teacher to improve the overall classroom environment."}

This model assumes that the behavior is caused by a underlying disease, and that doctors can diagnose and treat the disease to change the behavior.\nSome researchers criticize the medical model for neglecting social circumstances, such as stress or a lack of support from friends and family. They argue that social circumstances can be a contributing factor to psychologically disordered behavior. For example, a student who is unable to spend time with friends or family may be at risk for depression.\nOther researchers have criticized the medical model for ignoring the importance of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals in the brain that are believed to be involved in mood disorders. Critics of the medical model point out that doctors can't use neurotransmitters to diagnose disorders such as depression or anxiety.\nIt is essential to consider the strengths and weaknesses of different models when examining research on the causes of behavior. Different models may emphasize different factors.\nSOLUTION: Depression, anxiety disorders, and neurotransmitters are all examples of factors that are neglected by the medical model. The medical model assumes that specific diseases are associated with specific patterns of behavior. But researchers have found that social circumstances and neurotransmitters can also be contributing factors to psychologically disordered behavior."}

According to Piaget, cognitive development involves the accommodation of new information. When we learn something new, our existing schemas must be changed or adjusted to accommodate the new information. This adjustment can be difficult, especially if the new information does not fit into our existing schemas. If the new information is not accommodated, it can cause cognitive dissonance.\nCognitive dissonance is the feeling of discomfort that arises when we have information that is inconsistent. For example, if we believe that exercise is bad for you, but we hear that our friend believes that exercise is important for your health, we may feel cognitive dissonance. This discomfort can motivate us to change our beliefs so that they are consistent.\nAccommodation is the process of changing our schemas to fit the new information. If we change our belief about exercise to fit our friend's belief, then we have accommodated our schema.\nPiaget's theory also describes how humans develop increasing abilities to think about moral and abstract concepts. As we get older, we become more able to think about abstract concepts, such as justice. We also become more able to think about the perspectives of others.\nSOLUTION: Piaget's theory does not suggest that rewards and punishments are the only way to learn. Instead, learning can occur when there is a change in our schemas. This change can be caused by accommodation.\nAccommodation can be difficult, especially when the new information is not immediately rewarding or punishing. However, learning does not require immediate rewards or punishments. Instead, learning can involve the gradual assimilation of new information."}

It can be modified by the consequences of that behavior. Consequences are outcomes that come after a behavior. Consequences can make a behavior more or less likely to happen again.\nThere are two main types of consequences: punishments and rewards.\nA punishment is a consequence that makes a behavior less likely to happen again. A punishment may include a loss of something the person wants or needs, such as time alone, a favorite toy, or money.\nA reward is a consequence that makes a behavior more likely to happen again. A reward may include something the person wants or needs, such as a treat, a special toy, or a trip to the park.\nSOLUTION: A punishment is a consequence that makes a behavior less likely to happen again. A punishment may include a loss of something the child wants or needs.\nGrounding a child for two weeks after the child has misbehaved is a punishment. The child loses the ability to go places or do things.\nNegative punishment is taking away something the person wants or needs as a consequence of a behavior.\nGrounding a child for two weeks after the child has misbehaved is a negative punishment. The child must give up something he or she wants or needs: going places with friends.\nCompliance learning is a behavior that is made more likely to happen again as a result of a consequence.\nCompliance learning happens when a person behaves in a way that benefits him or her. For example, a child may learn to comply with his or her parents' requests because the parent will then buy the child dinner.\nGrounding a child for two weeks after the child has misbehaved is not compliance learning. The child does not benefit from being grounded.\nNegative reinforcement is a consequence that makes a behavior more likely to happen again by taking away something the person wants or needs.\nNegative reinforcement happens when a person behaves in a way that removes an unpleasant situation. For example, a child may complain of a stomach ache to get out of school.\nGrounding a child for two weeks after the child has misbehaved is negative reinforcement. The child behaves in a way that removes the unpleasant situation of being grounded.\nAvoidant attachment is a pattern of behavior that makes it difficult for a person to form close relationships. A person with an avoidant attachment pattern may push others away.\nGrounding a child for two weeks after the child has misbehaved is not an avoidant attachment. The child does not push others away."}

When we observe others performing a behavior, we can learn to do it ourselves.\nAggressive behavior is a prime example of a learned behavior. Children do not come into the world holding rocks and attacking other children. Instead, they learn these behaviors from their environment.\nChildren observe the behaviors of others and then imitate them. When a child observes an aggressive act, such as a punch or a kick, he or she may imitate that act. Over time, the child may learn to use aggression to solve problems or to get what he or she wants."}

They happen because of changes that take place in the body as a result of long-term use of a substance.\nWhen a person uses a substance over an extended period, the body adapts to the presence of the substance. Because of these adaptations, the body is no longer able to function properly without the substance.\nWhen the substance is withdrawn, the body is no longer able to maintain optimal function. This lack of optimal function is what causes withdrawal symptoms.\nTolerance is what happens when the body adapts to the presence of a substance. As the body adapts, it needs higher and higher doses of the substance to feel its effects.\nDissociation is a change in awareness or perception that can be caused by drug use. Dissociation can lead to a sense of detachment from the mind or body.\nActivation-synthesis is a theory that explains how the brain may create conscious experiences. Withdrawal symptoms may be caused by changes in the brain that are related to the activation of unpleasant memories or sensations.\nRole theory is a sociological theory that explains how people may adopt the behaviors or values of their social groups. Withdrawal symptoms are not directly caused by changes in roles."}

Some defense mechanisms are more likely to be used by people who are under stress or who have low self-esteem. Other defense mechanisms are more likely to be used by people who are confident or who have a strong sense of self.\nFreud believed that many of our personality traits are developed during childhood. He believed that children use defense mechanisms to cope with stress or anxiety that they experience. He also believed that these defense mechanisms can affect personality.\nFor example, a child who regularly displaces anger from a sibling onto a parent may develop a persistent anger management problem. Or, a child who frequently uses repression to avoid anxiety may develop problems with memory and may be more likely to have a mental breakdown later in life.\nSOLUTION: Freud would suggest that Chantal's behavior exemplifies projection.\nChantal believes that her mother is domineering and overbearing. However, Chantal attributes these characteristics to her mother instead of acknowledging that she has these feelings herself."}
{"question": "Which of the following terms describes the behavioral component of negative attitudes toward particular groups?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bias"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Conditioning"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Catharsis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Discrimination"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Negative attitudes are formed when people associate particular groups with negative experiences. This association can be caused by in-group favoritism, out-group prejudice, or the behavior of others.\nWhen people are exposed to negative stereotypes about a group, they may come to believe that the stereotypes are true. This is known as self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, if a teacher expects minority students to underperform, the teacher may inadvertently create a self-fulfilling prophecy that causes the minority students to underperform.\nPeople can also learn attitudes and behaviors from their environment. This process, called conditioning, involves both classical conditioning and operant conditioning.\nClassical conditioning involves learning to associate a neutral stimulus with a meaningful stimulus. For example, a person may learn to associate the sound of a siren with the approach of an ambulance.\nOperant conditioning involves learning to associate a behavior with a consequence. For example, a person may learn to associate smoking with a boost in mood.\nCatharsis involves the release of strong emotions. This theory suggests that expressing strong negative emotions can actually increase negative attitudes.\nFor example, imagine that a person is extremely angry with a particular group. If this person is able to express his or her anger, the theory of catharsis suggests that the person may feel better. However, the person may still hold a negative attitude toward the group.\nBias is a tendency to respond to a group in a consistently negative way. This behavior is known as a bias. Biases can be directed at people or groups.\nFor example, a bias against immigrants would be a negative attitude toward immigrants. A bias against minorities would be a negative attitude toward minorities.\nSOLUTION: The term bias describes the behavioral component of negative attitudes toward particular groups. Bias occurs when people consistently act on negative attitudes."}

It has many functions, including regulation of hunger, thirst, and body temperature.\nThe hypothalamus helps to keep your body healthy by sending messages to other parts of the body. For example, when the hypothalamus senses that you are hungry, it sends a message to the cortex. The cortex then sends a message to go get something to eat.\nWhen the hypothalamus senses that you are overweight, it sends a message to the cortex. The cortex then sends a message to reduce food intake.\nSOLUTION: The hypothalamus is responsible for regulating hunger. A lesion, or injury, to the hypothalamus could disrupt this regulation. So, a severely overweight rat would most likely result from lesioning of the hypothalamus."}

These two types of learning are called reinforcement and punishment, respectively.\nReinforcement happens when you do something and then something good happens. This makes you more likely to do that something again.\nPunishment happens when you do something and then something bad happens. This makes you less likely to do that something again.\nThe effect of punishment is weaker than the effect of reinforcement. For example, if you try to quit smoking and you experience no punishment, but your friends and family continue to smoke around you, you may be more likely to smoke again.\nA punishment is not as strong as a reinforcement. For example, if you have to pay a hefty fine if you break a rule, you are less likely to break the rule, but you may still break the rule if the fine is not too severe.\nShaping involves breaking a behavior down into smaller parts and reinforcing each part. This makes the behavior easier to teach.\nFor example, if you want to teach a dog to speak, you might start by reinforcing the dog for making sounds. The first sounds may not sound like words, but they are a step in the right direction. As the dog makes more sounds, you can reinforce the dog for making sounds that slightly resemble words. This process can help the dog learn to speak.\nThe law of effect says that behaviors that are reinforced are more likely to happen again. This happens because the behavior is associated with a positive outcome.\nThe partial reinforcement effect says that behaviors that are sometimes reinforced can become more likely to happen. This happens because the behavior is associated with occasional positive outcomes.\nSecond-order conditioning happens when a behavior that is reinforced becomes associated with a secondary consequence. This secondary consequence may then be reinforced, which makes the behavior even more likely to happen.\nFor example, imagine that a bell rings every time the door opens. After a while, the sound of the bell becomes associated with customers entering the store. This may make you more likely to greet customers as they enter the store.\nSOLUTION: The technique Coach Perry is using is shaping. Coach Perry starts by rolling the ball to Lana slowly so she can stop it. As Lana becomes successful at stopping the ball, Coach Perry gradually begins to roll the ball faster."}

A sensor may be a specialized cell, as are the photoreceptors in the eye, or it may be a structure that contains specialized cells, as is the cochlea in the inner ear.\nOnce a stimulus is detected by a sensor, it is transmitted to the brain for processing. This transmission is called sensory transduction. Sensory transduction involves converting the stimulus into a signal that the brain can understand.\nThe signal is then analyzed by the brain, which uses it to guide behavior. Behavior can include anything from simple responses, such as flexing a muscle, to complex behaviors, such as riding a bicycle.\nSOLUTION: To hear a sound, Sanja must first detection the sound waves that the sound sends through the air. This process is called auditory detection.\nThe sound waves are funnelled by Sanja's ear into the inner ear, where they stimulate the cilia. This process is called auditory transduction.\nThe vibrations of the cilia move a fluid in the inner ear. This fluid flows over hairs that are covered in hair cells.

An impression is a belief about another person, and these beliefs can affect how you behave toward them.\nResearch has shown that people can make impressions of others based on different kinds of cues. These cues include personality, behavior, and appearance.\nOther research has shown that people can change their impressions after learning more about the other person. Impressions are not carved in stone; they can be updated as more information becomes available.\nAn important clue to forming impressions is language. Words and phrases can influence how people think about others.\nFor example, the words warm and bright suggest positive characteristics. The words cold and dark suggest negative characteristics.\nResearch has found that language can also affect how people think about social groups. For example, calling someone a genius suggests that the person is smart. But calling someone a fool suggests that the person is stupid.\nLinguistic relativity is the idea that the language you speak affects how you think. This idea appears to be true.\nFor example, some languages have different words for things that are not always distinct in other languages. In English, for instance, the words democratic and republican describe different political systems. But in a country where the language is Spanish, the words democr\u00e1tico and republicano describe different things.\nGender schema theory states that people have schemas, or mental frameworks, about what is appropriate behavior for men and women. When people observe behavior that matches their gender schema, they consider it male or female.\nBut if behavior does not match their schema, people may perceive it as neither male nor female. Instead, they may categorize it as bad, inappropriate, or gender-neutral.\nThe social role hypothesis states that people form impressions of others based on the social roles that society expects to see. For example, people expect men to be strong and assertive, and women to be nurturing and emotional.\nIf someone does not act according to their social role, people may consider them to be deviant. But if most people expect others to act in a certain way, those who do not may be seen as the norm.\nModeling is a type of learning in which people observe and imitate other people's behavior. People learn what to do by watching other people do it.\nFor example, children learn how to eat by watching their parents eat. They imitate what they see and hear."}

This is because the cones, which are specialized for color vision, are more sensitive to light than the rods, which are specialized for black and white vision.\nIn bright light, the cones are activated, and the rods are no longer sensitive. When the light dims, the role of the two types of receptors changes. The cones become less sensitive, and the rods become more sensitive.\nSOLUTION: Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nIn dim light, the cones cannot detect color. This is because the cones require more light to be activated in dim light than the rods. So, in dim light, the rods are responsible for color vision."}

This means that we can perceive objects as having certain properties because of the way the parts are organized.\nFor example, we can perceive a three-sided object as being a triangle, even though it is partially blocked from view. This is an example of closure.\nWe can also perceive objects as having a continuity, or a smooth connection between their parts. This is usually because of the way the parts are arranged.\nSimilarity means that we perceive objects as having parts that are similar to other parts of the object. Proximity means that we perceive objects as being close to other objects.\nSOLUTION: To determine which principle of Gestalt theory this example illustrates, consider whether the object is organized as a whole.\nBeing partially blocked out should not change the fact that the object is a triangle. The part of the object that is blocked out is still connected to the other parts. So, the object is still organized as a whole.\nAs a result of this organization, we can perceive the object as having the property of triangularity."}

They are based on different assumptions about what is important to understand about behavior. According to the psychoanalytic perspective, behavior is shaped by unconscious thoughts and feelings, and these can be revealed only through special techniques such as free association, dream analysis, and transference. The behavioral perspective, in contrast, assumes that behavior is shaped by events that can be observed and measured. It emphasizes the importance of learning and the environment in shaping behavior. The cognitive perspective assumes that behavior is shaped by underlying thoughts and beliefs. It emphasizes the importance of thinking and the ways in which people perceive and interpret information. The humanistic perspective emphasizes the importance of subjective experiences, such as motivation, self-esteem, and cognitive dissonance.\nSOLUTION: Psychoanalysis relies on the scientific method. It involves making observations about behavior and inferring the underlying thoughts and feelings from these observations.\nPsychoanalysts focus on the unconscious mind. Unconscious thoughts and feelings are not directly observable, but can be inferred from behavior.\nThe process of psychoanalysis takes a long time and is focused on individuals, not groups. Psychoanalysts believe that understanding an individual's unconscious thoughts and feelings leads to insight into the individual's behavior.\nThe research psychoanalysis is based on primarily involves people with psychological disorders. Psychoanalysis was first used to treat psychological disorders. It has since been used to understand the unconscious thoughts and feelings of all types of people."}

As a wave, sound has both a frequency and a wavelength.\nFrequency refers to the rate at which the sound wave moves. The higher the frequency of the sound wave, the higher the pitch of the sound.\nWavelength refers to the distance between the same points on consecutive sound waves. The shorter the wavelength of the sound wave, the more intense the sound.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nChanging the frequency of a sound wave changes the pitch of the sound. But the frequency of a sound wave is not affected by the volume of the sound.\nVolume is related to the intensity of the sound wave. Intensity can be affected by the distance between the sound source and the observer. But the frequency of the sound wave is not affected by the volume of the sound.\nThe secretions of the pituitary gland do not affect the frequency of the sound wave.\nMore neurons firing more frequently would increase the intensity of the sound.

How can you determine if an experiment is well designed? In order to do this, you need to figure out if the experiment's participants were chosen randomly.\nExperiments are designed to do two things: to control the variables that are different between the groups in the experiment and to measure the variables that are the same between the groups. This allows the experiment to determine if the different groups have different outcomes.\nFor example, imagine you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. You randomly assign each tomato plant to a group (the fertilized group or the unfertilized group). Then, you measure the effect of fertilizer on the number of tomatoes.\nIf one group of tomatoes was fertilized and the other was not fertilized, but fertilizer has no effect on tomato growth, the number of tomatoes will be the same in both groups. In this case, the experiment can conclude that fertilizer has no effect on tomato growth.\nBut how do you know if fertilizer has no effect on tomato growth? You would need to perform hundreds of experiments, fertilizing some plants and not fertilizing others, and measure the effect on tomato growth.\nSOLUTION: The advice columnist received over 28,000 responses to a column.

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways. Inherited traits are passed down through families. Acquired traits are gained during a person's life.\nSome theories of motivation explain innate or acquired traits as the causes of behavior. An innate trait is a trait that is present from birth. Acquired traits are gained during a person's life.\nOther theories of motivation discuss the effects of the environment on behavior. One theory is the drive theory. The drive theory says that behavior is caused by biological drives or instincts. A biological drive is a built-in motivation that drives an organism to take a certain action.\nAnother theory is the reinforcement theory. The reinforcement theory says that behavior is motivated by the consequences of that behavior. If a behavior is followed by a positive consequence, the behavior is reinforced. If a behavior is followed by a negative consequence, the behavior is punished."}

Because images can be highly detailed, visual imagery may be an effective encoding method for memorable material.\nAuditory cues involve encoding information using sound. Some people find that associating information with familiar tunes or rhymes helps them remember.\nEchoic memory captures the sound of a spoken word for a very short time (about one second) after the word is spoken. This technique may help remember a word or phrase that is about to be spoken.\nThe method of loci is a memory aid that employs visual imagery. To use it, you create a mental image of each item you want to remember and then place it in a location in your mind. For example, you might associate an item with a room in a house.

This voltage change attracts positive ions to the cell's underside. When the neuron fires, the voltage drops, and the positive ions move to the top of the cell.\nThis change in the voltage of the cell membrane creates a temporary electrical current. The electrical current attracts negatively charged ions towards the cell. The electrical current also causes the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that influence whether a neuron will fire.\nThe neurotransmitters make the neuron's membrane more likely to fire. When the neuron's membrane fires, it sends a signal to the next neuron.\nThe next neuron's membrane is more likely to fire when neurotransmitters are present.

If a person is unable to see the traffic signal, a special device can be installed in the car to warn the person when the light is about to change. This is an example of accommodation.\nA halo effect is when an outstanding performance in one area causes you to expect outstanding performance in other areas. A halo effect can occur when a teacher has high expectations for a student.\nConvergence is the term used when a person's past and present performances come together. For example, a person who has been performing poorly in school may suddenly begin getting good grades.\nModeling is the term used when a person looks up to someone else and imitates that person. If a person sees that a sibling is an outstanding driver, the person may begin driving in the same outstanding way.\nSOLUTION: The text tells you that Tina is a good student, but her accident during driver's ed. was a surprise. The instructor's disbelief is a result of a halo effect. The instructor expected Tina to excel at driving, without any mistakes."}

This hypothesis is based on the idea that expressing strong emotions can help people feel better. But some research has called into question whether expressing strong emotions actually has a positive effect on people's moods.\nCounterconditioning involves replacing unhealthy habits with healthy ones. Counterconditioning can help people reduce aggressive tendencies by teaching people more constructive ways to deal with their frustrations.\nTransference is when people apply past experiences and feelings to their interactions with someone or something in the present.

The counselor is expected to maintain the privacy of the communication, but there are some limits to confidentiality. Limits to confidentiality are generally placed in order to protect the client, other people, or the public at large.\nThere are several principles that guide counselors in making decisions about confidentiality:\n1. Duty to warn and protect: Counselors have a duty to protect their clients and others from harm. If a client discloses a plan to harm himself or others, the counselor may be required to warn the intended victim(s) and take other protective actions.\n2. Responsibility to maintain privacy: Counselors must respect their clients' right to privacy and keep confidential all information disclosed during the counseling relationship. There are, however, some specific situations in which a counselor may be required to disclose information without the client's consent.\n3. Need to obtain informed consent: Counselors must obtain the client's informed consent before disclosing any information about the client. Informed consent requires that the client be knowledgeable about the proposed disclosure and the potential consequences of that disclosure.\n4. Need to maintain accurate records: Counselors must maintain accurate and complete records of their services. These records may include information about the client's background, diagnosis, treatment plans, and progress.\nSOLUTION: The Tarasoff v.

{"question": "A person suffering from a skin rash finds her pain is temporarily relieved by vigorous scratching. She does not perceive the pain from the rash while she is scratching, but the pain returns soon after she stops scratching. Which concept best explains this temporary pain relief?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "opponent-process theory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "amplitude and frequency theories"}, {"label": "C", "text": "transduction theory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "gate-control theory"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Our bodies have specialized sensory cells called nociceptors that can detect potentially damaging stimuli. When these cells are stimulated, they send information about the harmful event to the brain, which processes the information and sends a response back to the body.\nThe brain can choose not to send pain signals to the body in response to a stimulus. For example, the brain may decide that a stimulus is not harmful, or that it is not worth sending pain signals to the body. In this case, the brain acts as a gate, preventing pain signals from being sent to the body.\nSome stimuli cannot be gate controlled. For example, pain from a bone fracture cannot be prevented by the brain.\nThe brain can also change the volume of pain signals that are sent to the body. For example, the brain may decide that a stimulus should be processed as more or less painful. In this case, the brain is adjusting the gain control of pain.\nThe frequency of a pain signal cannot be changed. A pain signal is always sent as a sharp, brief pain.\nSOLUTION: The person scratches her skin rash, which relieves the pain. But the pain returns soon after she stops scratching. This situation is called counter-irritation. Counter-irritation can provide temporary pain relief.\nThe opponent-process theory explains how the brain can use opposing pain signals to provide pain relief. For example, touching a hot object causes pain. But touching a cold object can hurt less. The opposite pain signals may conflict with each other, creating a state of counter-irritation that relieves pain."}

According to Aaron Beck's negative triad theory, a depressed person's view is that the world is dangerous, and they are in danger of it. So, withdrawal is a strategy that a depressed person may use to cope with the three primary stresses\u2014change, death, and monetary instability. But it is not the depressed person's view.\nDepressed individuals believe that when they are in a group, at least three individuals will view them negatively.\nThis answer is not correct.

It works best when groups or individuals are encouraged to freely share their thoughts.\nThe owner of the company has just asked you to determine why costs were higher this month. You decide to brainstorm with the office manager and the head of the manufacturing department.\nDuring the brainstorming session, the office manager wonders if the costs were higher because more materials were used. The head of manufacturing notes that production goals were higher this month. Both the office manager and the head of manufacturing agree that the number of hours worked by employees was higher.\nThis brainstorming session has allowed you to generate several possible reasons for the increase in costs.\nDeductive reasoning is a process in which a conclusion is drawn from a general rule or principle.\nConvergent thinking is the process of finding a single best answer or solution.\nGroupthink can occur when a group makes irrational or poor decisions because of strong group cohesiveness and the desire for harmony."}

Basic research is designed to discover new information about mental processes.\nOther psychologists use applied research methods to solve problems. Applied research is designed to describe patterns of behavior and to solve problems that people face.\nSOLUTION: Psychology arose out of philosophy, cross-cultural anthropology, and physiology.\nPhilosophy helped to shape the structure of psychology as a field. Philosophers' ideas about mental processes helped psychologists to understand the nature of consciousness and the mind.\nCross-cultural anthropology influenced psychology by showing that behaviors and customs are not universal. Researchers discovered that behaviors and customs could be different in different cultures.\nPhysiology was important to the development of psychology. The study of the nervous system and the brain has helped psychologists to understand the biological basis of behavior.\nBiochemistry did not contribute to the rise of psychology.

How do experiments do this? Experiments isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.\nExperimental research involves making careful observations and measurements. To determine the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable, experimenters manipulate the independent variable and measure the effect on the dependent variable.\nFor example, imagine that you want to determine the effect of caffeine on writing. To do this, you could do the following:\nFirst, you would have participants in an experimental group drink a caffeinated beverage. Then, you would have participants in a control group not drink a caffeinated beverage. Next, you would have participants in both groups do a writing task.\nBy comparing the writing of participants in the experimental group to the writing of participants in the control group, you can determine the effect of caffeine on writing.\nSOLUTION: Experiments determine causal relationships by isolating the effects of independent variables on dependent variables. Other research methods do not have the same control over conditions.\nExperiments are designed to ensure that only one variable is different between groups. This makes experiments particularly good at determining the effects of that variable.\nExperiments typically involve more participants than other research methods do.\nExperiments can involve more people, but the number of participants is not what makes experiments determining causal relationships.\nExperiments are more precise than the other research methods.\nExperiments are designed to be as precise as possible.

Classical conditioning and operant conditioning are two types of conditioning.\nClassical conditioning was first described by Ivan Pavlov. It involves pairing a neutral stimulus with a naturally occurring stimulus. When the neutral stimulus is heard, it can become a signal that the naturally occurring stimulus is about to happen. For example, the sound of a bell being heard before a meal happens naturally. By pairing the sound of the bell with the meat, the bell becomes a signal that the meat is about to be served.\nOperant conditioning was established by B.F. Skinner. It involves using reinforcement to strengthen a response. Reinforcement is what comes after a response and makes it more likely to happen again. Consequences are divided into two types: reinforcers and punishers. A reinforcer is something that comes after a response and makes it more likely to happen again. A punisher is something that comes after a response and makes it less likely to happen again. For example, after a dog does something, its owner may give it a treat. The treat is a reinforcer because it makes the dog more likely to do what it just did. If the dog takes longer to do its task, its owner may turn on a flashing light. The flashing light is a punisher because it makes the dog less likely to do what it just did.\nSOLUTION: Look at the key differences between classical and operant conditioning:\nOperant conditioning was established well before classical conditioning.\nClassical conditioning involves pairing stimuli, and operant conditioning involves pairing a response with a stimulus.\nOperant conditioning is used to train organisms to perform specific acts, and classical conditioning is used to get organisms to stop performing specific acts.\nClassical conditioning is more difficult to use but more effective than operant conditioning."}

Shape constancy allows you to recognize a familiar object regardless of the view of the object.\nImagine looking at a friend's car from different angles. From some angles, the car's license plate is obstructed. You know that the car is still there, even though you can't see the license plate. Shape constancy allows you to recognize the car, even though its appearance has changed.\nThe autokinetic effect is the tendency to perceive objects in motion as being closer than they actually are.

Basic needs are required for survival, while advanced needs are not.\nMaslow identified several types of advanced needs. These needs are not as obvious as basic needs, but they are just as important to people.\nOne of these advanced needs is the need for esteem. When this need is not met, people may become depressed or unhappy.\nMaslow believed that there are two types of esteem needs:\nEsteem needs for self-esteem. Self-esteem is the feeling that you are competent and worthy. Maslow believed that people need to find meaning in their actions and accomplishments.\nEsteem needs for reputation. Reputation is the feeling that others think well of you. Maslow believed that people need to be recognized by others for their accomplishments.\nMaslow was not the first person to identify the need for self-esteem. Earlier psychologists, such as William James and Sigmund Freud, had already done so. However, Maslow was the first person to distinguish between these two types of esteem needs.\nSOLUTION: According to Maslow, esteem needs must at least be partially met before one is prompted to satisfy love needs. The desire to be loved by others is not as important as the need for self-esteem.\nSo, esteem needs must come before love needs."}

They can be useful in revealing particular patterns of behavior or experience.\nA case study may be significant for one or more of the following reasons:\nIt is the first recorded case of a particular pattern of behavior or disorder.\nIt is an important example of a common pattern of behavior or disorder.\nIt is a rare or unusual case that sheds light on a common pattern of behavior or disorder.\nIt is a case that supports a particular theory or hypothesis.\nIt is a case that refutes a particular theory or hypothesis.\nWhen you are considering whether a case is significant, consider how well the case supports or refutes a theory or hypothesis. If a case is rare or unusual, it may be significant in helping to develop a theory or hypothesis. If a case is the first recorded case of a particular pattern of behavior or disorder, it is significant for that reason.\nSOLUTION: This answer is incorrect.\nThe case study of Phineas Gage's brain injury was significant for several reasons. It was one of the first well-documented examples of a specific brain area being associated with a set of physical and emotional changes. It was also one of the first cases to provide evidence that brain function can be affected by brain damage.\nThe CAT scan was used for the first time in the Phineas Gage case to document the extent of brain injury. However, the significance of Gage's accident in the history of brain imaging does not necessarily make the case study significant.\nGage's accident provided psychiatrists with one of the first opportunities to treat a brain-damaged patient with psychotherapeutic techniques. However, this answer is incorrect. This case study is not significant because psychotherapeutic techniques were not used to treat Gage.\nGage's accident was one of the first to be treated with drugs that alter the neurotransmitters in the brain. However, the use of drugs that alter neurotransmitters was not pioneered by Gage's physicians."}

Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.\nConservation refers to the understanding that experiences are based on the relationships between things.\nIntrospection involves examining one's own thoughts and emotions.\nTransposition involves changing the order of words or phrases in a sentence.\nEgocentrism involves being self-centered and assuming that others think and feel as you do.\nSOLUTION: The lack of understanding reflects a simple mistake in transposing the words sister and aunt. Jen thinks that her mother's sister is her aunt, when in fact, her mother's sister is her own age. This error indicates that Jen is unaware of the relationships between people."}

A conclusion reached through inductive reasoning may not be completely certain, but it is generally strong.\nWhen you observe many incidents of a specific type of behavior, you can make a general prediction that this behavior will continue in the future. For example, you may observe many incidents of a dog barking at a post in its yard. From these observations, you can infer that the dog barks at the post every day.\nSOLUTION: Statistical reasoning is similar to inductive reasoning, but it involves more formal methods of data collection and analysis.\nProbabilistic reasoning involves calculating the probability that a general proposition is true, based on the results of a study. For example, a study may show that women who take a certain medication during pregnancy have a 3% chance of having a baby with a birth defect.

This natural internal rhythm is called a circadian rhythm.\nThe word circadian comes from the Latin words circa, which means \"about,\" and diem, which means \"day.\" A circadian rhythm is affected by exposure to light and darkness.\nMany animals, including people, have a circadian rhythm that takes about 24 hours to repeat. This means that different parts of a day are marked by different levels of alertness and different hormone states.\nSOLUTION: Our behaviors and alertness levels are influenced by our circadian rhythms. Different activities, such as eating and sleeping, are linked to different parts of our circadian rhythm.\nA sleep cycle is caused by your circadian rhythm. A sleep cycle consists of several stages of sleep.\nA daily routine is a schedule of activities that a person follows each day. Daily routines can help define a person's circadian rhythm.\nPersonalities are not circadian rhythms. But they affect a person's daily routines."}

To answer a question with an experiment, decide whether the part of the system that is tested is the part that causes the effect.\nFor example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. Pea plants are the part of the system that is tested. Adding fertilizer to the soil is the part of the system that is changed. To answer your question, you need to decide if pea plants affect how tall they grow.\nExperiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the part of the system that will be tested and the part that will be changed.\nNaturalistic observation involves making observations in the natural world. To answer a question with naturalistic observation, look for patterns in the data.\nFor example, imagine you want to find out how plants grow in different types of soil. You could observe which plants grow taller in soil with more nutrients.\nCorrelation involves noting patterns of association between two variables. One variable is usually measured first, and then the other variable is measured.\nFor example, imagine you want to find out if there is a relationship between wearing seat belts and avoiding car accidents. First, you would observe which cars have seat belts and which cars do not. Then, you would observe which cars were in accidents.\nCase study involves looking at individual cases or cases from a small group. To answer a question with a case study, look for patterns in the data.\nFor example, imagine you want to find out if having a safety engineer on a construction site decreases the number of accidents. You could look at how many accidents occurred on construction sites with and without safety engineers.\nSOLUTION: The hypothesis suggests that two things are directly related to each other. To answer the question with a correlation, you would observe whether the two things are related. For example, you could calculate the correlation between buying hybrid cars and spending more money on organic foods.\nHowever, the question asks which research method would most likely be used. A correlation can be used to answer this question, but an experiment would be more likely to determine whether buying a hybrid car causes you to spend more on organic foods."}

They can make it difficult to determine whether the independent variable is actually responsible for the observed result.\nIn the experiment, the psychologist is comparing the performance of two groups of second-graders. One group is from the Antrim School, and the other is from the Barton School. The psychologist is testing the students on the same exam on the same day.\nSo, the psychologist is testing the same grade in each school on the same day. This design does not expose the students to the same teaching methods or school surroundings. So, the school variable is not a confounding variable.\nHowever, testing the students at two different times on the same day may introduce a confounding variable. For example, the second group of students may be tired or hungry during the test. This could affect their performance on the exam.\nSo, the psychologist is comparing the same grade in each school on the same day. This design does not expose the students to the same teaching methods or school surroundings. So, the school variable is not a confounding variable."}

These theories range from those that focus on the differences between people to those that focus on how people are alike.\nCarl Rogers's humanistic theory of personality emphasizes the ways in which people are alike. According to Rogers, every person has an inherent drive to fulfill their potential. This drive motivates people to learn, to grow, and to achieve their goals.\nRogers believed that people's personalities are mainly formed by their experiences. Behavior that is reinforced by positive feedback tends to be repeated. When people receive praise for behaving in a certain way, they are likely to repeat that behavior in the future."}

It is based on the theory that negative patterns of behavior can be learned, and positive patterns can be unlearned.\nTherapists use different techniques to help patients overcome troublesome behaviors. Some common techniques are:\nAntecedent-based strategies involve presenting the patient with a different response to a situation. For example, a patient who experiences anxiety when meeting new people may be taught how to introduce herself in a calm, self-assured manner.\nArousal-based strategies involve helping the patient change the way he or she feels during a particular situation. For example, a patient who feels anxious when facing a difficult test may be taught how to use deep breathing to feel more relaxed.\nSOLUTION: All of the following are ways in which behavioral therapy may alter the patterns of responding of clients:\nBy helping patients identify a hierarchy of anxiety-arousing experiences, therapists can help patients face their fears in a controlled and safe way.\nBy vigorously challenging clients' illogical ways of thinking, therapists can help clients change their patterns of thinking.\nBy influencing patients by controlling the consequences of their actions, therapists can help patients learn new ways of behaving.\nBy repeating or rephrasing what a client says during the course of therapy, therapists can help clients examine their thoughts and behaviors more closely."}

He believed that unconscious thoughts and feelings influence behavior. Freud developed theories about the id, ego, and superego, and he created therapeutic techniques such as dream analysis and free association.\nThe cognitive perspective focuses on mental processes such as thoughts, memories, and language. Psychologists who adhere to the cognitive perspective believe that these mental processes play a major role in shaping behavior.\nThe behavioral perspective focuses on observable behavior. Psychologists who adhere to the behavioral perspective believe that behavior can be studied directly, and that behavior can be changed through conditioning.\nThe biological perspective focuses on the role of genetics and biology in behavior. Psychologists who adhere to the biological perspective believe that behaviors are influenced by genes and the brain."}

Neurons communicate with each other by sending signals across small gaps called synapses.\nWhen a neuron sends a signal to another neuron, it releases a chemical called a neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The synaptic cleft is the space between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another neuron.\nAfter the neurotransmitter is released, it binds to receptors on the other neuron. This binding triggers the other neuron to send a signal.\nThe axon of a neuron is covered in a tight coat of lipids. These lipids keep the neurotransmitters in the axon until the neuron is ready to release them.\nSOLUTION: The nodes of Ranvier have not yet formed.\nThe nodes of Ranvier are glycoprotein structures that form along the axon of a neuron. They are important for the rapid transmission of signals along the axon.\nSo, for the first few weeks of life, a baby's vision is poor because the nodes of Ranvier have not yet formed."}
