A theory is a set of ideas that are supported by evidence and are widely accepted. A hypothesis is an idea that is not yet supported by evidence.\nThe spiral of silence is a theory. Researchers have observed the spiral of silence in many different groups and situations.\nMost people do not express their minority opinions when they are in a group that does not support them. This happens because people usually base their opinions on the opinions of those around them. As a result, people in a minority group may be less likely to express their true opinions.\nThis pattern of silence can lead to a spiral, in which the minority opinion is not expressed, and as a result, the majority opinion is reinforced. This reinforcement can make the majority opinion dominant, and the minority opinion can become even more rare.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is B.\nHiding opinions is a form of silence. When people hide their opinions if they do not agree with the majority, they are acting as if they are in a minority group."}

Today, most theories consider active, not passive, recipients. In fact, the audience is often seen as an integral part of the mass communication process.\nIn recent years, scholars have examined the ways in which audience members actively make meanings from media messages. These meanings are not passively received, but are instead the result of complex interactions between the audience member and the message.\nFor example, when an audience member watches a political news program, she does not simply passively receive a message that tells her how to think. Instead, she uses her own political beliefs to interpret the message. She may agree or disagree with the message, and may even change her beliefs in light of the information.\nIn this way, audience members are active receivers of media messages. They may interpret a message in more than one way, or even ignore the message altogether. Thus, audience members are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages."}

Being able to choose an appropriate communication strategy is a key part of being an effective communicator.\nWhen considering areas of communication, some questions to ask include:\nWhat is the purpose of the communication?\nWhat is the audience?\nWhat are the communication objectives?\nWhat are the budget and timeline?\nNonprofits are organizations that are designed to provide social benefit.

This is called a population proportion.\nThe formula for calculating a population proportion is:\nproportion = (number of individuals with the characteristic / total number of individuals in the population)\nFor example, if 500 out of 2,500 women in a population are over 60 years old, then the proportion of women over 60 is 500/2,500, or 1/5.\nIn order to determine the proportion of nonprofit sector practitioners who conduct audience research, you need to use this formula.\nFirst, calculate the number of practitioners who conduct audience research. Then, calculate the total number of practitioners. Finally, divide the number of practitioners who conduct audience research by the total number of practitioners to find the proportion.\nSOLUTION: You are given that 1,000 nonprofit sector practitioners out of 15,000 conduct audience research.\nSo, the number of practitioners who conduct audience research is 1,000.\nThe total number of practitioners is 15,000.\nThe proportion of nonprofit sector practitioners who conduct audience research is 1,000/15,000, or 1/15.\nThis means that approximately one-quarter of nonprofit sector practitioners conduct audience research."}
