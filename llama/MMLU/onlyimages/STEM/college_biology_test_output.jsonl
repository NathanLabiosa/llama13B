It represents a population that is growing at a rate that is limited by the supply of food and other resources. The shape of the logistic curve is determined by the function K = 1 / (2c), where K is the carrying capacity of the environment and c is the mortality rate.\nWhen the K value of the curve has been reached, the population is at its carrying capacity. From this point on, the population will not increase, but it may still experience fluctuations about its new equilibrium.\nMaintaining the population at a point corresponding to the midpoint of its logistic curve means maintaining the population at its carrying capacity. This ensures that the population does not exceed the environment's capacity to support it, but it does not prevent the population from fluctuating about its equilibrium.\nOpting for zero population control once the K value of the curve has been reached means allowing the population to fluctuate about its equilibrium. This may be a viable option if you are willing to accept some level of population variability.\nReducing the carrying capacity of the environment to lower the K value can be an effective method of population control. This directly affects the rate at which the population grows, and it can help to reduce the population to a level that is below its carrying capacity.\nIncreasing the mortality rate can be an effective method of population control. This directly affects the rate at which the population grows, and it can help to reduce the population to a level that is below its carrying capacity."}

In animals, fertilization usually involves the fusion of the sperm with the egg on the surface of the female. This is called external fertilization. In some animals, fertilization involves the sperm fusing with the egg inside the female. This is called internal fertilization.\nAlmost immediately after a sperm fuses with an egg, the embryo begins to divide. This is the beginning of embryonic development.\nDuring fertilization, the sperm and egg fuse to form a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg then begins to divide, eventually developing into an embryo.\nThe fertilization reaction is the series of events that occur immediately after a sperm fuses with an egg. These events include the fusion of the male and female pronuclei and the beginning of embryonic development.\nThe acrosomal reaction is the process in which the sperm loses its acrosome. The acrosome is a structure at the head of the sperm. It contains enzymes that can help the sperm penetrate the egg. During the acrosomal reaction, the sperm loses its acrosome and uses its enzymes to create a pathway into the egg.\nThe cortical reaction is the process in which the eggs in an animal's eggs begin to move.

Tropical rain forests have the following features: year-round rain and warm temperatures, soil that is poor in nutrients, and many different types of organisms.\nSoil leaching is the process of water washing soil nutrients out of the soil. In tropical rain forests, nutrients are washed out of the soil quickly, because of the high amount of rain. This means that tropical rain forests have a high rate of nutrient leaching.\nCycling of nutrients is the process of nutrients being used by organisms and then being returned to the soil. In tropical rain forests, many different types of organisms are using nutrients and returning them to the soil. This means that tropical rain forests have a high rate of nutrient cycling.\nThe tundra, taiga, and desert are not tropical rain forests.

They are called catalysts because they increase the reaction rate without being consumed in the process.\nEnzymes do not directly cause a reaction to occur. Instead, they alter the conditions of a reaction to make it more likely to happen. Enzymes can do this by:\nattracting reactants to the enzyme\nhelping reactants to fit together\nremoving intermediates from the reaction mixture\nchanging the temperature of the reaction mixture\nchanging the equilibrium constant of the reaction\nWhen a reaction is performed by an enzyme, the enzyme can change the conditions of the reaction to make it proceed more quickly. For example, the enzyme may increase the temperature of the reaction mixture, or it may change the equilibrium constant of the reaction to favor the product.\nMany other chemical reactions in the body also involve the change of an equilibrium constant. For example, the body keeps the concentration of a substance called bicarbonate ions in the blood constant by using an enzyme to change their equilibrium constant.\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction tells you the ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium. If an enzyme changes the equilibrium constant of a reaction, it changes the ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium. For example, if an enzyme changes the equilibrium constant of a reaction from 1:1 to 1:2, this means that for every two reactants at equilibrium, one product is produced.\nSOLUTION: Enzymes are effective in facilitating chemical reactions by increasing the maximal rate of the chemical reaction (V_max). They do this by lowering the activation energy for the reaction.\nThe activation energy for a reaction is the minimum amount of energy that must be provided to the reactants to start the reaction. Enzymes can lower the activation energy for a reaction by changing the structure of the reactants. For example, an enzyme may help reactants to fit together in a way that requires less energy.\nBy lowering the activation energy for a reaction, enzymes make it easier for the reaction to occur. This means that more reactants can convert to products at a given time. As a result, the maximal rate of the reaction (V_max) increases."}

This is called zero population growth.\nIf the natality rate is higher than the mortality rate, the population grows exponentially.\nIf the mortality rate is higher than the natality rate, the population declines exponentially.\nSOLUTION: A population explosion is a rapid increase in the size of a population. If the natality rate is higher than the mortality rate, the population grows exponentially. So, a population explosion occurs when a population is growing at its exponential rate.\nA population crash is a rapid decrease in the size of a population.

Cell motility can be deliberate, such as when a immune cell moves to a site of infection, or it may be an unintentional result of cell growth.\nWhat drives cell motility? Cells move using protrusions called lamellipodia and filopodia. When a cell wants to move, it forms lamellipodia and filopodia at its edge. The cell can then use these protrusions to push against the surrounding matrix and move.\nCells also use their neighbors to pull and push on each other. For example, when one cell wants to move away from its neighbors, it can use its adhesion plaques to pull away.\nAdhesion plaques are specialized proteins that link the cell to the surrounding matrix.

The coefficient of relatedness is a measure of how closely two individuals are related. It is given by the probability that two randomly chosen alleles in the two individuals are identical.\nThe frequency of the altruistic allele is a measure of the proportion of the population that carries the gene for the altruistic trait. This frequency can affect the rate at which the altruistic allele spreads through the population. But the frequency of the altruistic allele does not affect whether an altruistic trait can evolve.\nThe inbreeding coefficient is a measure of the proportion of an individual's genes that come from their parents. Inbreeding can lead to harmful genetic effects, but it does not affect whether an altruistic trait can evolve.\nThe rate of reciprocity is a measure of how often an individual encounters the same reciprocal altruist. This rate can affect how often an individual can help a reciprocal altruist. But the rate of reciprocity does not affect whether an altruistic trait can evolve."}

This extra air contains more oxygen than their lungs would have captured at a normal breathing rate. So, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in their blood decreases, and the concentration of hydrogen ions also decreases. This is because the body uses carbon dioxide as a signaling molecule to help regulate blood pH. When the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood decreases, the body can use the extra oxygen it has taken in.

This association may persist over generations because the same alleles at the two genes are inherited together.\nSOLUTION: Asexual reproduction does not promote linkage disequilibrium. In asexual reproduction, offspring are produced without the involvement of parents. So, no alleles are inherited from parents.\nCoadapted gene complexes, epistasis, and random mating do promote linkage disequilibrium.\nCoadapted gene complexes are groups of genes that have been adapted to work together. The genes in a coadapted gene complex may be physically close to each other. If they are, they may be inherited together.\nEpistasis is a type of gene interaction in which one gene affects the expression of another gene. This type of interaction can lead to linkage disequilibrium, because offspring genotypes that include the epistatic gene may be more or less common than expected under equilibrium.\nRandom mating does promote linkage disequilibrium. If mating is random, offspring genotypes will be produced in equal proportements. This means that linkage disequilibrium will be temporary, because each generation will increase the likelihood that offspring genotypes will be produced in equilibrium."}

In terms of pressures within the venous and arterial compartments, this transfer results in a decrease in venous pressure and an increase in arterial pressure.\nThe pressure within a compartment is affects by the volume of fluid in the compartment and the cross-sectional area of the blood vessels in the compartment. These three factors are known as the hydrostatic forces.\nSo, an increase in venous pressure and a decrease in arterial pressure occur because the ventricular stroke volume increases the volume of blood in the arterial compartment and decreases the volume of blood in the venous compartment. This change in volume affects the hydrostatic forces in both compartments.\nThe volume of blood in the arterial compartment increases, which means that the cross-sectional area of the blood vessels in the arterial compartment is increased. Consequently, the arterial pressure increases.\nThe volume of blood in the venous compartment decreases, which means that the cross-sectional area of the blood vessels in the venous compartment is decreased. Consequently, the venous pressure decreases.\nSOLUTION: The transfer of a volume of blood equivalent to the stroke volume results in an increase in venous pressure and a decrease in arterial pressure.

Soon after hatching, all chicks must make their way to the ocean. Chicks from cliff nests must tumble down the cliff to get to the ocean, and many are killed by the fall.\nWhether a chick survives the fall depends on the distance the chick falls and the time it takes to reach the ocean. The farther the chick falls and the longer it takes to reach the ocean, the more likely the chick is to be killed by the fall.\nMany chicks survive the fall from the cliffs. This suggests that cliff nesting is adaptive in the goose species.\nA higher proportion of the population nesting on cliffs than on beaches means that cliff nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting. This indicates that cliff nesting is adaptive in the goose species.\nMore chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed is consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive. This means that chicks have a better chance of surviving to reach the ocean than they do of being killed in the fall.\nMany more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.

They can increase the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the process.\nEnzymes work by reducing the activation energy for a reaction. The activation energy is the energy that must be overcome to get a reaction started. Enzymes can reduce the activation energy for a reaction by binding to the substrate.\nSubstrate is the substance that the enzyme acts on. The substrate binds to the enzyme, and then the enzyme and substrate bind together to form an enzyme-substrate complex. This complex has a lower activation energy than the substrate or the enzyme alone, so the reaction proceeds at a faster rate.\nIonizing groups are groups of atoms that can gain or lose electrons. These groups can participate in a reaction by attracting or repelling other atoms.\nMany enzymes require ionizing groups on both the enzyme and the substrate to participate in the reaction. These ionizing groups may attract or repel each other, which can break bonds between atoms in the substrate.\nSOLUTION: If the activity of an enzyme is constant over a broad range of pH values, it is likely that ionizing groups on the enzyme and substrate are participating in the reaction. The pH of a substance depends on the ratio of hydrogen ions to hydroxide ions. Ionizing groups can affect the ratio of hydrogen ions to hydroxide ions.

They can grow into a tumor, which can invade nearby tissue and spread to other parts of the body.\nContact inhibition is a mechanism that prevents cells from dividing without a surface to attach to. Normal cells grown in culture exhibit contact inhibition. They stop dividing when there is no surface for them to attach to. Cancer cells, on the other hand, do not display contact inhibition. They can keep dividing without a surface to attach to.\nAttaching to a surface is necessary for many cell functions, including cell growth. Normal cells and cancer cells can both attach to a surface. But cancer cells can also grow in the absence of a surface.\nThe density of cells in a culture depends on the number of cells plated and the size of the culture container. Both the number of cells plated and the container size affect the cell density. So, cancer cells and normal cells can proliferate to the same cell density without necessarily reaching the same number of cells."}

This change can be measured and used to identify the proteins that are binding. One technique that uses this principle is the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).\nIn an EMSA, DNA is separated by size in an electric field. Proteins that are bound to the DNA will move at a different rate than DNA fragments that are not bound to proteins. By comparing the migration of bound and unbound DNA fragments, you can identify the proteins that are binding to the DNA.\nSOLUTION: An EMSA can be used to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences. Western blot hybridization, northern blot hybridization, and southern blot hybridization are techniques that use hybridization to detect specific DNA sequences. They cannot be used to demonstrate protein binding to DNA."}

They use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves.\nFlowering plants use a method of reproduction called sexual reproduction. This means that the flowers use their male and female parts for reproduction.\nMost flowering plants have flowers with both male and female parts. The male part produces pollen, and the female part produces eggs and a sticky substance on the edge of the pistil.\nBees, butterflies, and other insects can be pollinators. Pollinators can move pollen from the male part of one flower to the female part of another flower. This can help the sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs.\nWhen a pollinator visits a flower, it can also collect pollen on its body. When the pollinator moves to the next flower, it can transfer pollen to that flower's male part.\nThe fertilized eggs grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.\nThe new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm life cycle again.\nSOLUTION: Wind-borne pollen is a characteristic unique to angiosperms.\nFlowering plants can use their flowers to reproduce without the need for an animal pollinator. They can use wind to move pollen. When pollen lands on a pistil, it can germinate and fuse with eggs.\nA dominant sporophyte life cycle is not a characteristic unique to angiosperms.\nIn a dominant sporophyte life cycle, the sporophyte is the dominant phase of the plant. This means that the sporophyte is the part of the plant that grows leaves and produces flowers.\nMany plants use a dominant sporophyte life cycle. This type of life cycle is not a characteristic unique to angiosperms.\nAlteration of generations is a characteristic of plants.\nAlteration of generations is a type of life cycle. In an alteration of generations life cycle, the haploid generation precedes the diploid generation. This type of life cycle is not unique to angiosperms.\nDouble fertilization is a characteristic unique to angiosperms.\nAngiosperms are the only plants that have double fertilization. In double fertilization, pollen fertilizes the eggs of the pistil, and the sperm from the pollen fuse with the eggs. This is different from other plants, where pollen fertilizes the female part of the flower."}

Many factors can affect an organism's metabolic rate, including its body size, activity level, and climate.\nMammals are homeostatic for body temperature, which means that mammals have a fixed body temperature. To maintain this temperature, mammals' metabolic rates change.\nBlood glucose concentration is a key example of a homeostatic mechanism. The concentration of glucose in the blood is regulated by the body. If the concentration gets too high or too low, the body will create new regulations to bring it back to its homeostatic set point.\nBlood pH is a measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of the blood. The body works to keep blood pH at a homeostatic set point.\nMetabolic rate is a measure of how much energy an organism uses. Metabolic rate is not homeostatic.

It assumes several conditions are met: no new mutations, high rates of reproduction, and random mating.\nMutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation. But in a population with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, new mutations are not considered. Instead, the model uses the genotypes and frequencies from the previous generation to predict the genotypes and frequencies in the next generation.\nPopulations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are large, with many individuals. The larger the population, the more likely that two individuals who are mates will be randomly chosen to reproduce.\nIn populations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, offspring phenotypes are determined by the parents' phenotypes and genotypes. There is no selection for or against phenotypes.\nGenetic drift is the change in the frequency of a gene in a population over time. In contrast to natural selection, genetic drift is a stochastic process; it is determined by random events.\nSOLUTION: Genetic drift, random mating, and absence of selection are conditions that are not assumed by the Hardy-Weinberg model.\nA large population is not a condition of the Hardy-Weinberg model.

Protein function is often determined by the sequence of amino acids in the protein. This sequence is encoded by the protein's genes.\nProtein function can also be determined by which amino acids are modified. Proteins can be modified by the addition of small chemical groups, called post-translational modifications. These modifications include phosphorylation, which is the addition of a phosphate group.\nPhosphorylation is a common post-translational modification that can affect protein function. It is encoded by proteins called kinases, or phosphorylates, which add the phosphate groups. Kinases are activated by signals from upstream cells, which cause a change in the conformation of the kinase protein. This conformational change activates the kinase, allowing it to phosphorylate proteins.\nOncogenes are genes that are involved in the development of cancer. The src oncogene is an oncogene that encodes a protein called a kinase. This kinase is activated by a signal from upstream cells, which causes a change in the conformation of the src protein. This conformational change activates the src kinase, allowing it to phosphorylate proteins. One of the proteins that the src kinase phosphorylates is a protein called a adenylate cyclase.

It involves changes in the frequencies of alleles in a population's gene pool from one generation to the next. These changes can include both increases and decreases in allele frequencies.\nThere are many factors that can affect allele frequencies. Some of these factors include natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation.\nNatural selection is a process that occurs when some alleles increase the chances that an organism will survive or reproduce. As a result, the frequencies of those alleles increase in the population.\nGenetic drift is a process that occurs when random events affect the survival or reproduction of organisms. As a result, some alleles may increase or decrease in frequency in the population.\nMutation is a process that involves changes to an organism's genotype. These changes can include changes in the frequencies of alleles in the organism's genotype.\nEvolution can occur through any of these processes. But whether or not evolution has occurred depends on whether the frequencies of alleles in a population's gene pool have changed.\nSo, the frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool must have changed over successive generations in order for evolution to have occurred. This change can include an increase or a decrease in the frequencies of alleles."}

Enzymes decrease the activation energy of a reaction by providing a low-energy pathway for the reaction to proceed.\nAn enzyme's ability to catalyze a reaction is called its specificity. An enzyme is specific for a reaction because it binds to certain substances, called substrates, that are part of that reaction.\nSOLUTION: At the maximal rate of reaction, the change in free energy of the reaction decreases. The reaction is proceeding in the direction that requires the lowest amount of free energy.\nThe enzyme is still specific for acetaldehyde at the maximal rate of reaction. This means that the enzyme is binding to acetaldehyde and increasing the reaction's rate.\nThe activation energy of the reaction decreases at the maximal rate of reaction.

{"question": "Which of the following best explains how mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A different polypeptide is produced."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nucleic acids are methylated."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: An organism's phenotype is the outcome of its genotype. The genotype is a organism's genetic makeup, and the phenotype is the result of the organism's genes being expressed.\nAn organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.\nA mutation is a change in an organism's genotype. Mutations can occur in an organism's DNA. DNA is the genetic material in all organisms.\nWhen a mutation occurs, it can change a gene. This can change the sequence of the protein encoded by that gene. So, the mutation can change the structure of the protein.\nThe function of a protein is determined by its sequence. So, if a mutation changes a protein's sequence, it can also change the protein's function.\nHow do mutations in DNA result in the expression of a new phenotype? There are several ways this can happen. One way is that the mutation may change a gene's instructions for making a protein. For example, the mutation may add or delete a few amino acids from a protein. This can change the protein's function.\nAnother way is that the mutation may change the location or timing of gene expression. The expression of a gene refers to the process by which the information in a gene is used to make a protein. If a mutation changes when or where a gene is expressed, it may change when or where the protein is produced.\nSOLUTION: A different polypeptide is produced.\nA polypeptide is a chain of amino acids. Each protein is a polypeptide.\nMutations in a gene's instructions for making a protein can change the sequence of the protein. This can change the structure of the protein. So, the mutation may change the polypeptide that is produced.\nThe polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA.\ntRNA stands for transfer RNA. It is a type of RNA that carries amino acids to the ribosome. The ribosome is the part of the cell where proteins are made.\nAn organism's DNA is used to make RNA. The opposite polarity indicates that the RNA is used for a different purpose. So, this change may affect how RNA is made. But it is not making a new protein. So, it is not a way that a mutation can change a phenotype.\nNucleic acids are methylated.\nMethylation is a chemical modification. It involves adding a methyl group. This can affect how a gene is expressed. But it is not making a new protein. So, it is not a way that a mutation can change a phenotype.\nThe gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction.\nHow a gene is read affects the protein that is made. The 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction tells you the order of the nucleotides in the RNA copy of a gene. Changing the reading frame of a gene can change the protein that is made. So, this change may change the protein that is made. This can change the phenotype."}

The greater the amplitude of the action potential, the more strongly the neuron is stimulated.\nThe number of synapses crossed refers to the number of synapses between neurons that are activated by an action potential. This number can affect the strength of the stimulus that is detected by the brain.\nSOLUTION: The threshold potential varies with the stimulus intensity.

When gene flow occurs, it increases the genetic similarity between populations. This means that the metapopulation becomes more genetically homogeneous.\nAn increase in the rate of deleterious mutations in the metapopulation occurs as a result of gene flow. This is because gene flow allows deleterious mutations to spread more quickly throughout the metapopulation.\nAn increased likelihood of speciation refers to the possibility that gene flow could contribute to the formation of a new species. This is a rare outcome, and it is unlikely to be caused by gene flow between populations.\nDisruption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the metapopulation occurs when there is a change in the frequencies of alleles in the metapopulation. This change can be caused by many factors, including gene flow."}

These factors include not only day length but also temperature and the levels of certain hormones.\nFlowering is often triggered by a change in day length. Longer days seem to stimulate the production of flowers. In most temperate plants, flowers appear when the day length reaches a certain threshold.\nTemperature is another important factor. Flowering is often delayed when temperatures are low and hastened when temperatures are high.\nThe levels of certain hormones can also affect when a plant flowers. One hormone, abscisic acid, can inhibit flowering. Another hormone, gibberellic acid, can stimulate flowering.\nSOLUTION: A plant in a temperate ecosystem can use a photoperiod to determine when to flower. A photoperiod is a measurement of the periods of light and darkness in a 24-hour period. In most temperate plants, flowers appear when the days get longer.\nFluctuations in abscisic acid levels can also affect when a plant flowers. But changing abscisic acid levels are not a reliable way for a plant to determine when to flower. The levels of abscisic acid can change for many reasons, including changes in temperature and water availability.\nChanging air temperature is not a reliable environmental signal that a plant in a temperate ecosystem could use to initiate flowering. Temperature can affect when a plant flowers, but the thresholds for temperature are often different from the thresholds for day length.\nThe circadian rhythm is a 24-hour pattern of behavior. It is possible that a plant in a temperate ecosystem could use its circadian rhythm to determine when to flower. But using the circadian rhythm to figure out when to flower would not be the most dependable method."}

This high concentration of H+ in the solution outside the mitochondria increases the concentration of H+ in the intermembrane space.\nAn increase in the concentration of H+ in the intermembrane space causes the mitochondria to pump H+ to the matrix. This pumping of H+ to the matrix creates a greater concentration of H+ in the matrix than in the intermembrane space.\nThis increase in the H+ concentration in the matrix is what drives the production of ATP in the mitochondria.\nThe production of ATP in the mitochondria is a process that consumes ATP. So, the more ATP that is produced, the more ATP is consumed.\nSOLUTION: A low external pH increases the concentration of H+ in the intermembrane space. This increase in the concentration of H+ in the intermembrane space causes the mitochondria to pump H+ to the matrix. This pumping of H+ to the matrix increases the concentration of H+ in the matrix.\nThe increase in the H+ concentration in the matrix is what drives the production of ATP in the mitochondria.

Behaviors can be triggered by specific stimuli, and each stimulus elicits a specific response. This sequence of behaviors is called a fixed action pattern.\nAnimals have a natural tendency to follow fixed action patterns. This tendency is called instinct. Instincts are inherited, and they can include both behaviors and the neural mechanisms that produce them.\nA fixed action pattern occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life. This means that the animal's first exposure to a stimulus does not trigger a fixed action pattern. But the second time the animal is exposed to the stimulus, the fixed action pattern is triggered.\nA motor response is a type of behavior. Motor responses are produced by the muscles. When an animal performs a motor response, its muscles can continue to move without further input. This is called the release of the motor response.\nSOLUTION: A fixed action pattern is triggered by a specific stimulus. This stimulus may include a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment. But the fixed action pattern does not occur in the absence of sensory feedback.\nA fixed action pattern is not a motor response. A motor response may be triggered by a fixed action pattern, but the two are not the same.\nA fixed action pattern is not triggered by a single sensory signal.

Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.\nAfter pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.\nSome plants can use different animal pollinators for different flowers on the same plant. For example, flowers on one side of a plant might be pollinated by bees. Flowers on the other side of the plant might be pollinated by hummingbirds.\nSOLUTION: Bees have a hard time reaching the nectar in pendant flowers. Pollination by bees is limited when flowers are pendant.\nHummingbirds can easily reach the nectar in pendant flowers. Pollination by hummingbirds is likely to increase when flowers are pendant.\nNectar with a high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts encourages pollinators to visit flowers.

These mutations often have profound effects on the function of homeotic genes.\nOne of the key functions of homeotic genes is to determine the positions of different body parts along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Mutations in homeotic genes can disrupt this process, leading to defects in the arrangement of body parts.\nThere are four major defects in the anterior-posterior pattern that can result from mutations in homeotic genes:\nabsence of a group of contiguous segments: One of the most severe defects is the absence of a group of contiguous segments. This defect results in the absence of one or more body parts in the region of the embryo that is affected.\ntransformation of one segment into another: Another defect is the transformation of one segment into another. This defect results in the exchange of positions of two body parts in the embryo.\npolarity defects in every segment along the anterior-posterior axis: A more subtle defect is the presence of polarity defects in every segment along the anterior-posterior axis.

Whether an excretory organ produces hypotonic or hypertonic urine affects where in the animal's body the organ can excrete waste.\nJuxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine. This means that the mammalian kidney can produce urine that is higher in solute than the surrounding tissue. This design allows the mammal to excrete waste products into the urine.\nThe kidneys of desert mammals produce urine that is hypoosmotic to the urine of freshwater fishes.

Mimicry can take different forms, or types.\nOne form of mimicry is Batesian mimicry, named after the British naturalist Henry Walter Bates. In Batesian mimicry, a harmless species mimics the appearance of a harmful one. This mimicry can provide the harmless species with a degree of protection from predators that prefer the harmful species.\nSOLUTION: C.\nA stinging bee is harmful to eat. A moth that exhibits nearly identical coloration to that of a stinging bee is mimicking a harmful species. This form of mimicry is an example of Batesian mimicry.\nThe other forms of mimicry are:\nA type of millipede that is toxic to a toad is permanently avoided by the toad following the toad's initial attempt to consume it. This is a form of mutualistic mimicry.\nDisoriented predators are not killed by the moth that exhibits false eyes at its tail end. So, this is not an example of Batesian mimicry.\nA ground-nesting gull chick displays a coloration pattern that is nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings. This is a form of crypsis, not mimicry."}

For example, when wolves eat elk, both the wolves and the elk are keystone species. The wolves affect the population of elk, and the elk affect the population of plants that the wolves and other herbivores eat. So, keystone species can have cascading effects on an ecosystem.\nKeystone species are thought to have profound effects on the structure and composition of ecological communities because they:\ncan prevent superior competitors from driving inferior competitors to local extinction.\nA superior competitor is a species that is better at using available resources than another species. For example, if a forest is invaded by a superior competitor, the inferior competitors may be driven to local extinction. This can change the structure of the community.\nKeystone species can prevent superior competitors from driving inferior competitors to local extinction. This keeps the community of species intact.\nSOLUTION: Keystone species are more abundant than most other species in their communities. They are not a separate group of species that are more abundant than other species. Instead, individual keystone species may be more abundant than most other individuals of other species."}

{"question": "A quote from a natural resources text states: \"Whenever the original ecosystem becomes restructured by man, it tends to become simplified, with a resultant disruption of the stabilizing influences of density-dependent regulatory factors.\" This implies that in a disturbed ecosystem", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "there exist large populations of a low number of species"}, {"label": "B", "text": "population levels of a species are kept at equilibrium through natural regulatory mechanisms"}, {"label": "C", "text": "a given prey organism is subject to higher predation rates by more diverse predators"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a given prey organism is less likely to undergo a population surge"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The quote describes how disturbances to an ecosystem can lead to a simplification of the ecosystem, with a disruption of the stabilizing influences of density-dependent regulatory factors. This can include a loss of biodiversity, or the variety of species in an ecosystem.\nHumans can disturb an ecosystem through activities such as farming, logging, or construction. When this happens, many species leave the area, and a few species may become abundant. These changes can cause the ecosystem to become simplified, with a smaller number of species.\nSo, a given prey organism is subject to higher predation rates by more diverse predators. This means that when a prey organism is part of a smaller number of species in an ecosystem, it is more likely to be eaten by a greater variety of predators.\nThis situation can happen after a disturbance, when the ecosystem is simpler and has fewer species. This means that a given prey organism is less likely to undergo a population surge. A population surge is a rapid increase in the number of individuals in a species.\nPopulation levels of a species are kept at equilibrium through natural regulatory mechanisms. An equilibrium is a state where something does not change. So, in an ecosystem, the population levels of a species are kept at a state where they do not change much.\nA given prey organism is less likely to undergo a population surge. A population surge is a rapid increase in the number of individuals in a species. So, a given prey organism is less likely to undergo a population surge when there are more predators in the ecosystem. This is because predators can eat prey, which can keep their populations from surging.\nA given prey organism is subject to higher predation rates by more diverse predators. This means that when a prey organism is part of a smaller number of species in an ecosystem, it is more likely to be eaten by a greater variety of predators."}

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett organism's genotype may have one or more dominant alleles for a gene. In this case, the Punnett organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett organism's genotype may have only recessive alleles for a gene. In this case, the Punnett organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett organism's phenotype may be either dominant or recessive.\nA organism's phenotype is always one of the two allele's versions of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett organism's phenotype is never a combination of the two allele's versions of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett organism's genotype may contain one or more alleles that are identical by state. These alleles are called identical alleles. Identical alleles have the same version of a gene's trait as each other. So, they do not affect the organism's phenotype for that gene.\nIf a Punnett organism's genotype has one or more dominant alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf a Punnett organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\n\nSOLUTION: The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is best explained by the interaction of two types of alleles.\nGray body and normal wings are the dominant allele's version of the body and wing color and texture genes' traits. A fruit fly with the dominant version of these traits must have at least one dominant allele for each of these genes.\nA fruit fly with the dominant version of these traits must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nBlack body and vestigial wings are the recessive allele's version of the body and wing color and texture genes' traits. A fruit fly with the recessive version of these traits must have only recessive alleles for each of these genes.\nA fruit fly with the recessive version of these traits must have the genotype bb.\nThis means that the two types of alleles in the question are the dominant and recessive alleles of the body and wing color and texture genes.\nThe presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is explained by the interaction of these two types of alleles. Some of the progeny have the genotype BB or Bb, which is the genotype with the dominant version of the body and wing color and texture genes' traits."}

In early-successional plant communities, primary production is high relative to standing-crop biomass, which means that these communities are characterized by high rates of organic matter production.\nSpecies turnover is the replacement of one species by another. In early-successional plant communities, species turnover is high, which means that many species can coexist in these communities.\nDisturbance is a major driver of early-successional plant community development. Disturbances, such as wildfires, windstorms, and floods, can create the conditions that favor early-successional species.\nHigh niche divergence among co-occurring species is predicted for an early-successional plant community. This means that the species that live in the community have many traits in common, but they are ecologically distinct from each other.\nHigh detrital biomass is not a characteristic of early-successional plant communities. Detrital biomass is the biomass of dead organisms. In early-successional plant communities, the biomass of dead organisms is low.\nHigh frequency of K-selected species is not a characteristic of early-successional plant communities. K-selection is a strategy that involves investing a lot of resources in a small number of offspring. In early-successional plant communities, the opposite is true: many offspring are produced, but few survive."}
