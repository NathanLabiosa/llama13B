The path will be a circle if the isotope's initial velocity is perpendicular to B.\nThe radius of the circle is given by the formula:\nr = m/q\nwhere m is the mass of the isotope and q is its charge.\nSOLUTION: To get a circular path with the largest radius, the mass of the isotope should be as small as possible and the charge should be as large as possible.\nUse the formula above to find the value of m/q.\nFor each isotope, calculate m/q.\nThe larger the mass of the isotope is, the larger its radius will be. So, you want to use the smallest possible mass.\nThe larger the charge of the isotope is, the larger its radius will be. So, you want to use the largest possible charge.\nThe radius is determined by the mass and charge of the isotope.\nSo, for a given mass, the larger the charge of the isotope, the larger its radius will be.\nLook at the choices.\nFor each isotope, calculate m/q.\nThe smallest mass is 16 u. The largest charge is -5e. So, the radius is 16 u/ -5e = 3.2 u.\nThe largest mass is 20 u. The smallest charge is -1e. So, the radius is 20 u/ -1e = 20 u.\nThe smallest radius is 3.2 u. The largest radius is 20 u."}

The higher the temperature of a substance, the more thermal energy the molecules in the substance have.\nSo, the molecules that make up a person have more thermal energy than the molecules that make up the air or water around them. This means that the molecules in the person are, on average, moving faster than the molecules in the surroundings."}

Fluids can flow without moving every particle in the substance. This flow is called a stream. The pressure of a fluid is called its stress. The higher the stress, the more strongly the fluid attracts or repels other objects.\nThe pressure at a point in a fluid is called the pressure at that point. The greater the pressure at a point, the more strongly the fluid at that point attracts.\nThe pressure at two points in a fluid is equal. This is called Pascal's principle.\nThe flow of a fluid is streamlined if the fluid moves through a tube with a cross-sectional area that is negligibly small. The flow of a fluid is steady if the flow rate is constant. The flow of a fluid is laminar if the flow is not steady but the fluid does not break into turbulence. The flow of a fluid is turbulent if the flow is not steady and the fluid breaks into turbulence.\nSOLUTION: The pressure at Point 2 is less than the pressure at Point 1 by 4 \u03c1v^2.\nThis is because the diameter of the pipe is smaller at Point 2 than at Point 1. The pressure at a point is proportional to the diameter of the pipe at that point.

On a string, the direction of the wave is from left to right. So, for a standing wave to occur, the length of the string must be a multiple of one-half the wavelength of the wave.\nThe wavelength of the wave is determined by the speed of the wave and the frequency of the wave. For a string, the speed of waves is fixed. So, the wavelength is also a multiple of the string's linear mass density.\nSOLUTION: The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is given by the equation:\nwavelength = speed of waves on the string / frequency of the wave\nThe speed of waves on the string is fixed. So, the wavelength is a multiple of the string's linear mass density.\n60 Hz is in the lowest range of audible sound. For many purposes, 60 Hz is not considered a standard frequency. Instead, the range of audible sound is usually defined as 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.\nThe string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave. To produce standing waves, the string length must be a multiple of one-half the wavelength of the wave.\nThe wavelength of the wave is equal to the speed of waves on the string divided by 60 Hz. This equation is consistent with the formula for the wavelength of a wave on a string."}

The frequency of the sound waves produced by a falling object appears to decrease as the object falls. This is because the object is gaining potential energy as it falls, which has the effect of reducing the frequency of the sound waves.\nSOLUTION: The frequency of a sound is higher than 400 Hz when the sound is falling. The frequency of the sound is higher than 400 Hz when the alarm is dropped. So, the measured frequency appears higher than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls."}

As a wave moves, the particle of the medium move from the area where the wave is at its highest point to the area where the wave is at its lowest point. This movement of particles is called a wave pulse.\nThe height of a wave is a measure of the distance from the surface of the medium to the wave's top. The higher the height of the wave, the more energy the wave carries.\nThe width of a wave is a measure of the distance from one crest (the top of the wave) to the next.
