Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\nThe test is a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.02.\nBecause the test is one-tailed, you need to find the P-value of the tail that is \"farthest from the mean.\" In a one-tailed test, the P-value is found by comparing the test statistic to the critical value from the appropriate tail. For a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.02, the critical value is 1.54.\nThe test statistic is 1.54. With a small sample size of seven, the critical value is 1.54.\nThe P-value is P(t > 1.54) with df = 7.\nSOLUTION: The P-value is given by the following formula:\nP(t > 1.54) with df = 7 = P(t > 1.54)\nSince the test is a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.02, you can use the following formula to find the P-value:\nP(t > 1.54) = 1 - min((1.54 - 0.02), 1) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98."}

For example, if a population has 100 elements, a random sample of 20 elements could be chosen by selecting numbers 1-20.\nA simple random sample is a random sample in which each element of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.

One possible outcome of analyzing the relationship is calculating the r value.\nRather than analyzing the effect of different things on the r value, this question asks you to identify what can affect the r value.\nAdding the same constant to all values of the x-variable does not affect the r value. This is because adding a constant to each value of the x-variable does not change the relationship between the x- and y-variables.\nThe choice of measurement units affects the r value. For example, a change from millimeters to meters affects the r value.\nBoth variables have the same units in this case.

Instead, correlation means that the two variables change together. For example, height and weight are highly correlated. This means that when one person's height increases, their weight also increases. However, height does not cause weight to increase.\nOne way to change the correlation between two variables is to add a constant to each value of one of the variables. This is called a constant change.\nImagine two variables, x and y. Suppose the correlation between x and y is r = 0.19. This means that when x changes, y changes by a reasonable amount.\nNow, imagine that 0.23 is added to each value of x. And, for each value of y, the value is doubled. This means that when x changes, y will change by a much larger amount than before.\nBut, the correlation does not tell you how much x and y will change together. It only tells you that they change together to some degree.\nSo, when you add 0.23 to each value of x and double each value of y, the correlation between x and y will increase. But, it is not possible to predict the new correlation from the original correlation.\nSOLUTION: Every value of the x-variable is increased by 0.23. So, the new correlation is 0.19 + 0.23 = 0.42."}

One of the ways in which they could calculate the effect size for this difference is by using the following formula:\nEffect size = (\u03bc1 - \u03bc2) / sqrt(\u03c31^2 + \u03c32^2)\nwhere \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are the mean proper behavior ratings for the two groups of children, and \u03c31^2 and \u03c32^2 are the variance of the proper behavior ratings for the two groups.\nSOLUTION: The null hypothesis is that the effect size is equal to zero. This means that the psychologist's belief that positive rewards are more effective than punishment is not supported by the evidence.\nThe alternative hypothesis is that the effect size is not equal to zero. This means that the psychologist's belief is supported by the evidence.\nTo calculate the effect size, the researchers can use the formula above. The value of \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 is not equal to zero. So, the effect size is greater than zero. This means that, on average, children who received positive rewards had higher proper behavior ratings than children who received punishment."}

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. In this case, fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating. The number of tomatoes is the variable that you are investigating. To answer this question, you decide to use fertilizer at different levels and measure the effect on tomato production.\nExperiments have rules called the experimental design. These rules make sure that the experiment is well designed. These rules include:\nRandomization: You assign each subject to a treatment by chance. This makes sure that any differences between the treatments are due to the fertilizer and not to which subject was assigned to which treatment.\nControl of confounding variables: A confounding variable is a variable that affects both the outcome and the effect of the fertilizer. You need to control confounding variables to get a clear picture of the effect of fertilizer.\nUse of a sufficient number of subjects: You need to use a sufficient number of subjects to get a precise measure of the effect of fertilizer.\nReplication: You run the experiment multiple times and average the results. This reduces the chance that the results are due to random chance.\nSOLUTION: A confounding variable is a variable that affects both the outcome and the effect of the fertilizer. You need to control confounding variables to get a clear picture of the effect of fertilizer.\nThe placebo effect is a confounding variable. A placebo is a fake treatment.

For a given sample size and significance level, the higher the power of the test, the more likely the test is to detect a true difference.\nOne way to increase the power of a test is to increase the size of the treatment groups.

Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. Which of the following statements is correct about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The correlation coefficient is -0.71."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The correlation coefficient is 0.71."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The correlation coefficient is -0.84."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The correlation coefficient is 0.84."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Scientists record climate data from places around the world.

You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.\nFor example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:\nYou grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is called the experimental group.\nYou grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants.

A confounding variable is a variable that is correlated with both the exposure and the outcome.

The t-distribution is a distribution that is similar to the normal distribution, but it has thicker tails. This means that the t-distribution is more spread out than the normal distribution.\nThe t-distribution has df degrees of freedom. The t-distribution is closest to the normal distribution when it has the same number of degrees of freedom as the data.\nThe 68-95-99.7 Rule is a rule of thumb that says that, for a normal distribution, about 68% of the values are within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% are within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% are within three standard deviations.\nThe t-distribution can be used to determine how many standard deviations to use for a data set. One way to do this is to find the number of degrees of freedom for the data. The smaller the df, the closer the t-distributions are to the normal distribution. So, for a given data set, the 68-95-99.7 Rule will give you the number of standard deviations to use for the t-distribution.\nSOLUTION: The t-distribution is lower at the mean and higher at the tails, and so are more spread out than the normal distribution. This means that, for a given data set, the t-distribution will have more spread than the normal distribution. This spread is equal to the difference between the tails of the t-distribution.\nFor the t-distribution to be closest to the normal distribution, that difference must be as small as possible. So, the smaller the df, the closer the t-distributions are to the normal distribution."}

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables. The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was the treatment. The number of tomatoes was the observation.\nSOLUTION: The control group is the group of plants that does not get the treatment.

This probability can be written as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning that the event will not happen and 1 meaning that the event will definitely happen.\nImagine an event with a probability of 0.5. This means that the event will happen 50% of the time.\nSOLUTION: The probability that at least one of them will ask her is 0.72. The probability that they both ask her is 0.18.\nFirst, calculate the probability that they both ask her: 0.18 = 0.72 \\* 0.18\nSo, the probability that at least one of them will ask her is 0.72, and the probability that they both ask her is 0.18.\nNext, calculate the probability that Ben asks her: 0.18 / 0.72 = 0.24\nSo, the probability that Ben asks her is 0.24."}

The mean is a measure of the center of a dataset.\nThe standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data around the mean. The greater the standard deviation is, the more spread out the data are.\nWhen the standard deviation is small, the mean is a good estimate of the center of the data. When the standard deviation is large, the mean is a less accurate estimate of the center of the data.\nSOLUTION: The standard deviation of the amount of coffee in the jars is 0.25 ounces. This means that the coffee is relatively consistent, with a small amount of spread.\nThe mean amount of coffee per jar is 4 ounces. This is the average amount of coffee in the jars.\nThe probability that the mean amount of coffee per jar is less than 3.9 ounces is given by the following fraction:\n0.25 ounces/4 ounces = 0.0625\n0.0625 is less than 0.075, which is 0.03.

This type of bias occurs when some members of the population have a zero probability of being selected for the sample.

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables. The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was the treatment, and the number of tomatoes was the response.\nThe purpose of an experiment is to find out how the treatment affects the response. So, in the experiment described above, you found out whether fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows.\nOther types of studies also have variables and responses. Observational studies compare things that are already different. For example, an observational study might compare the health of vegetarians to the health of people who eat meat.\nQuasi-experiments compare things that are already different but use a non-random approach to assign subjects to groups. For example, an educator interested in whether a new teaching method is effective might use a quasi-experiment. She assigns all students in an algebra class to one of two groups: those who learn with the new method, and those who learn with the old method. Then, she measures which group performs better on a test.\nSample surveys can be used to gather information about people. In a sample survey, people are selected from a larger group. For example, a survey might ask 500 people about their political beliefs.\nSOLUTION: Experiments, observational studies, and sample surveys are different types of studies. When discussing these types of studies, it is important to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the study that is tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed.

So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the study that is measured. The part of the study that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExamples of true statements are:\nNone of the studies are observational.\nThe treatments in a well-designed experiment are carefully planned to result in responses that are as similar as possible.\nIn a well-designed sample survey, sampling error is effectively eliminated.\nExamples of false statements are:\nA well-designed observational study does not include an experiment.\nIn a well-designed experiment, the treatments are carefully planned to result in responses that are as different as possible."}

Experiments are designed to test whether a hypothesis is true. Census data is data collected from a entire population.\nExamples of experiments include studies to determine whether a new drug lowers blood pressure and studies to determine whether adding fertilizer to soil increases crop yield.\nCensuses are not designed to test hypotheses. But, they can be used to calculate a measure of central tendency, such as the population mean, that reflects the results of all the experiments conducted by people in the population.\nA 95% confidence interval of the mean height of teachers in a small town. is a census. This estimate is based on the height of all the teachers in the town.\nA 95% confidence interval of the proportion of students in a small town who are taking some AP class. is a census. This estimate is based on the number of students in the town who are taking at least one AP class.\nA two-tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis was that the mean expenditure on entertainment by male students at a high school is the same as that of female students. is not a census. This analysis was designed to answer a specific question about whether the means are equal."}
