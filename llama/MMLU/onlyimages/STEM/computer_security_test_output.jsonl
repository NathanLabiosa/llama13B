Suppose that an attacker wants to find out your password. So, she choaches your account's hash. Then, she times how long it takes to hash passwords of different lengths. Because different-length passwords are hashed at different rates, the attacker can use the timing differences to make an educated guess as to your password.\nTo prevent timing attacks, many algorithms have been designed to reduce the variation in timing.

Some common block cipher modes of operation are:\nECB (Electronic Codebook): In ECB, each block of plaintext is encrypted independently. This mode is not very secure, because identical plaintext blocks are encrypted to the same ciphertext.\nCBC (Cipher Block Chaining): In CBC, each block of plaintext is encrypted with the previous ciphertext as the initialization vector. This mode is susceptible to certain types of attacks, such as the Padding Oracle Attack.\nCFB (Cipher Feedback): In CFB, each block of plaintext is encrypted and then fed back into the algorithm as the initialization vector. This mode is similar to CBC, but it is not susceptible to the Padding Oracle Attack.\nCTR (Ciphertext Transformation Mode): In CTR, the initialization vector is a block of random or pseudorandom bytes. This mode is used in applications such as SSL.\nOFB (Output Feedback): In OFB, the initialization vector is a block of random or pseudorandom bytes.

This is called non-repudiation.\nThere are several ways to achieve non-repudiation. One way is to use a digital signature. A digital signature is a type of digital stamp. It proves that the sender was the one who sent the message and that the message has not been altered.\nAnother way to achieve non-repudiation is to use a message authentication code (MAC). A MAC is a type of digital stamp that is used to authenticate a message.\nA MAC uses a secret key. The sender knows the secret key, but the receiver does not. When the sender sends the message, they create a MAC using the secret key. The sender includes the MAC in the message and sends the message to the receiver. When the receiver receives the message, they use the secret key to verify the MAC. If the MAC is verified, the receiver knows that the message was not altered and that it came from the sender.\nMessage integrity and message authentication are other ways to ensure that a message is not altered. These ways do not also ensure that the sender cannot deny having sent the message.\nMessage confidentiality is the opposite of message integrity.

A framework can include everything from a simple set of functions to a complex collection of tools.\nFrameworks can be tailored to a specific task, and they can make that task easier to perform. For example, a framework for web development might include templates for common web pages, libraries for interacting with databases, and tools for handling user authentication.\nMany vulnerabilities can be exploited by creating specialized software that incorporates the vulnerability. A framework can make this process easier by providing pre-written code that can be customized to a specific vulnerability. This is called a \"point-and-click\" framework.\nMetasploit is a framework. It provides a set of tools for exploiting vulnerabilities. It includes code for many different exploits, or point-and-click tools, for various vulnerabilities.\nZeus and Ettercap are not frameworks. They are stand-alone tools. Zeus is a banking Trojan that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage the Trojan's operations. Ettercap is a network auditing tool that allows a user to scan a network for vulnerabilities.\n.Net is a framework. It includes a set of libraries and tools for building software.
