This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nquantum efficiency = probability of detecting a photon / probability of a photon hitting the detector\n\nThe probability of detecting a photon is called the detection efficiency.\nThe probability of a photon hitting the detector is called the intrinsic efficiency.\nBoth the detection efficiency and the intrinsic efficiency are affected by the energy of the photon. For a given photon detector, the higher the energy of the photon, the higher the detection efficiency and the intrinsic efficiency.\nSOLUTION: The probability that a photon detector will detect a photon is 0.1. This means that the detection efficiency is 0.1.\nThe intrinsic efficiency is a function of the energy of the photon. For our photon detector, the intrinsic efficiency is 0.1.\nThe rms deviation is a measure of the spread of the distribution. The rms deviation of a normal distribution is given by the formula:\nrms deviation = \u221a(<(x - mean)^2> / n)\nIf one photon is detected every 10 photons, the mean number of photons per detection is 10. The mean number of photons per detection is 10. So, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times. The rms deviation is 1."}

This probability is given by the formula:\nquantum efficiency = number of detected photons / number of incident photons\n\nSOLUTION: The quantum efficiency of the photon detector is 0.1. This means that the detector will detect 0.1 of the incident photons.\nIf 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, the detector will detect photons. The detector will detect some number of the 100 photons. That number is 10 times the number of photons detected, on average.\nSo, the detector will detect an average of 10 times as many photons as are actually detected. This occurs because the detector does not detect all of the photons each time. Instead, it detects some photons on some occasions and not on other occasions. On average, it detects 10 times as many photons as are actually detected.\nThe variance, or average squared deviation from the average, is a measure of the spread of the data. The smaller the variance, the more consistent the data are.\nThe variance of the number of photons detected is given by the formula:\nvariance = average ^ 2\nUsing the formula for the average number of times as many photons are detected as are actually detected, the variance is:\naverage ^ 2 = 10 ^ 2 = 100\nSo, the average number of times as many photons are detected as are actually detected is 10, and the variance is 100.\nThis means that the number of photons detected will deviate, on average, by about 10 photons from the average number of photons detected. This deviation will occur around half of the time, and the other half of the time, the detector will deviate from the average number of photons detected by a smaller amount."}

For a given wavelength of light, the higher the pressure of the gas, the higher the index of refraction of the gas.\nSOLUTION: The interferometer was set up to produce fringes when the gas cell was evacuated. The number of fringes observed (100) was used to calculate the index of refraction of the original gas.\nThe formula for calculating the index of refraction of a gas is:\nindex of refraction = (wave speed of light in vacuum) / (wave speed of light in the gas)\nThe wave speed of light in vacuum is 299,792,458 m/s. The wave speed of light in the gas was calculated from the number of fringes observed.\nFirst, calculate the optical path length for the gas cell. The optical path length is the distance light travels through the gas cell. For a 10 cm optical path length and a 632.2 nm wavelength, the number of fringes is given by:\n100 = (optical path length / wavelength) / (1 / pressure of the gas)\nThe pressure of the gas was not given in the problem, so you can't calculate the index of refraction directly.\nHowever, you can use the fact that the higher the pressure of the gas, the higher the index of refraction of the gas. So, you can use the fact that the number of fringes increased from 50 to 100 to estimate the range of possible values for the index of refraction.\nThe formula for the index of refraction relates the pressure of the gas to the index of refraction. So, you can use the fact that the number of fringes increased from 50 to 100 to estimate that the pressure of the gas must have increased by a factor of 2.\nThis means that the index of refraction must have increased by a factor of 2 / 632.2e-9.\nThis factor is approximately 0.00016.\nSo, the index of refraction of the original gas is 1.00016."}

The lines are created when the atoms or molecules are excited by energy from light. As the atoms or molecules relax, they emit light at specific wavelengths.\nThe wavelengths of the lines are determined by the properties of the atoms or molecules. But the lines are also shifted due to the relative motion of the atoms or molecules and the observer. This shift is called a Doppler shift.\nThe Doppler shift is easier to understand if you think of a ambulance with a siren that is passing you. As the ambulance comes toward you, the siren sounds higher-pitched than it does when the ambulance is moving away from you. The pitch of the siren changes because the ambulance is emitting sound waves that are compacted together (shifted to higher wavelengths) as the ambulance comes toward you. Then, as the ambulance moves away from you, the sound waves become spread out (shifted to lower wavelengths).\nThe same thing happens with light and spectral lines. But in this case, the lines are shifted to longer wavelengths (redder light) when the object is coming toward you and to shorter wavelengths (bluer light) when the object is moving away from you.\nSOLUTION: The shift of the lines to longer wavelengths means that the quasar is moving away from us.
