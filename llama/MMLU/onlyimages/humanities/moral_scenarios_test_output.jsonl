These standards can be different in different cultures, and they can change over time. What one person considers to be the right thing to do may be different from what another person considers to be the right thing to do.\nOne way to decide what is right and wrong is to consider the impact of your actions on others. This is known as utilitarianism.\nAccording to utilitarianism, the right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. This definition allows for a number of different actions to be considered right. For example, saving one person from death could be considered right, or saving five people from death could be considered right.\nAnother way to decide what is right and wrong is to consider the rights of individuals. This is known as deontology.\nAccording to deontology, actions are right or wrong in and of themselves. Deontological theories do not focus on the consequences of actions. Instead, they consider the actions themselves to be right or wrong.\nFor example, according to deontological theory, it is always wrong to lie. No matter what the circumstances are, lying is considered wrong.\nSOLUTION: According to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020, it is not clearly wrong to nod to someone while driving.\nIt is also not clearly wrong to use fresh beef to make hamburgers.\nAccording to utilitarianism, the right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. Neither scenario affects other people's happiness. So, neither scenario is clearly wrong according to utilitarianism.\nAccording to deontological theory, it is always wrong to drive with a blood alcohol level of 0.08%. Driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.08% is clearly wrong. But nodding to someone while driving does not affect the assistant's ability to drive. So, nodding to someone while driving is not clearly wrong according to deontological theory."}

When you use first-person, you are writing about your own experiences, using words like \"I\" and \"me.\"\nThird-person is a point of view. When you use third-person, you are writing about someone else, using words like \"he,\" \"she,\" and \"they.\"\nUsing first-person point of view can make your writing more personal and intimate. It can also make your writing seem less formal.\nUsing third-person point of view can make your writing seem more objective and formal. It can also create a sense of distance between the reader and the writer.\nSOLUTION: In the first scenario, the main character takes her dog for a walk with a leash.

So, in order to identify what is clearly morally wrong, you need to figure out what was maximized and what was minimized.\nIn Scenario 1, the main character decided to free the animals at the zoo. This action has at least two effects:\nThe welfare of the animals might be improved, because they are no longer in an enclosure.\nHowever, the animals might escape and cause harm to people, or they might die if they are not adapted to live in the wild.\nSo, in this scenario, the main character does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards, by deciding to free the animals.\nIn Scenario 2, the main character whispered to a friend in the public theater as the movie played. This action does not seem to have any clear effects on anyone. So, it is not clearly morally wrong."}

One way to do this is to think about whether the action in question involves harming or violating the rights of others.\nImagine an ordinary person named Jack. Jack wants to find out how to determine what is clearly morally wrong. So, he asks an expert in moral philosophy for help. The expert tells Jack about the harm principle.\nThe harm principle says that it is morally wrong to harm others. This means that, according to the harm principle, it is clearly morally wrong to do something that involves causing harm to others.\nFor example, the harm principle would say that it is clearly morally wrong to hit someone.\nBut the harm principle does not say that it is always wrong to do something that might harm someone. For example, the harm principle does not say that it is always wrong to drive a car. Driving a car might cause harm to others, but it does not necessarily do so.\nSo, to determine what is clearly morally wrong, you need to figure out whether the action in question involves causing harm to others. If it does, then the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\nSOLUTION: In scenario 1, the main character adds a sprinkle of cinnamon to all of the coffees he made.

They can include traffic laws, tax laws, and laws governing business practices.\nEthical standards are not enforced by the government. Instead, they are followed by individuals and groups on their own. Many businesses, for example, follow a code of ethics that goes beyond what the law requires.\nEvery society has its own body of moral standards.

Throwing trash on the ground is a form of littering.\nLittering is wrong for several reasons. It can harm the environment. Animals may eat the litter, for example.

For example, stealing from a store may harm the store and the owner, and lying to a friend may harm the friendship.\nSOLUTION: Turning on the sprinklers during a baseball game is not seriously wrong.

For example, you might argue that it is wrong to eat meat, or that it is right to help others.\nWhen you are deciding whether to do something, you can use everyday moral standards to help you decide what is right or wrong. Everyday moral standards are the standards of right and wrong that most people follow in their everyday lives. These standards can include both legal and ethical rules.\nIn the United States, the law sets forth many everyday moral standards. For example, the law says that you must be 21 years old to buy alcohol. This law reflects the principle that it is wrong to give alcohol to minors.\nOther everyday moral standards are not part of the law.

So, in Scenario 1, the main character does something clearly morally wrong by peeing in the pool. This action is not done for its intended purpose, which is to cool off and enjoy the pool.

Some of these choices may affect how readers understand your writing.\nOne choice you can make is whether to use \"I\" or \"we.\" Using \"I\" indicates that you did the action. Using \"we\" indicates that you did the action as part of a group.\nAnother choice you can make is whether to use \"me\" or \"you.\" Using \"me\" implies that you do not want the action to be done to you. Using \"you\" implies that you do not want the action to be done to you either.\nA third choice you can make is how you describe what was done. The word \"clearly\" tells the reader that the main character did something wrong. The word \"according\" tells the reader that the main character did something wrong by certain standards. The word \"morally\" tells the reader that the main character did something wrong by certain moral standards. So, the passage tells you that the main character did something wrong by certain moral standards in the United States in 2020.\nSOLUTION: Look at the scenarios.

This action could be seen as causing the death of the person on the respirator. Causing the death of another person is generally seen as morally wrong. So, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in this scenario.\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tackles his baby girl on the field.

These principles might include values such as honesty, fairness, and compassion.\nSome of your moral standards might include rules that you follow. Rules can help you live according to your values. For example, if you think it is important to be honest, you might have a rule to never lie.\nA central idea in moral philosophy is that there are many principles that are widely shared among people. One reason for this is that some principles are necessary for human cooperation. If most people think that honesty, fairness, and compassion are important, they can rely on each other to some extent.\nIf a decision is consistent with your moral standards, it is hard to argue that the decision is clearly wrong. But this does not mean that your decisions are always right.\nYou can make a mistake about what your moral standards are, or you may have to make a decision that is inconsistent with your moral standards. For example, you may need to break a rule in order to live consistently with a value.\nIn the end, the only people who can say what is wrong are the people who know what your moral standards are.\nSOLUTION: Ordinary moral standards include values such as honesty, fairness, and compassion. Scenario 1 does not involve clear violations of these values. So, the main character does not do anything clearly morally wrong in Scenario 1.\nIn Scenario 2, the main character shows compassion to a shivering man. This action is not morally wrong."}
