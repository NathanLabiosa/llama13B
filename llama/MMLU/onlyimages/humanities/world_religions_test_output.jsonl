Yin and yang are opposite but complementary forces. For example, sunrise is yang, and sunset is yin.\nMencius, or Mengzi, was a philosopher who lived during the same time as Confucius. He believed that people are inherently good and that society should value and reward people based on their innate moral qualities.\nDaoism is associated with the idea that a natural, organic way of life is the best way to live. This idea is reflected in the Yin-Yang School's belief that natural phenomena can be explained by the interactions of yin and yang. But Daoism is not primarily concerned with ethics, as Mencius and the Yin-Yang School are.\nHumanistic Buddhism is a movement that emphasizes the importance of human needs and emotions.
