The coastal State is the State that has jurisdiction over the territory in which the ship is located. The flag State is the State that a ship is registered to.\nUnder the Convention on the High Seas, countries have jurisdiction over ships that are registered under their flag. This is known as flag State jurisdiction.\nCountries that have territory that is adjacent to the high seas have jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels that are located in that territory. This is known as coastal State jurisdiction.\nAll States enjoy such jurisdiction. This includes the flag State and the coastal State.\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is an international court that hears disputes related to the law of the sea.

On the other hand, R2P is a set of principles that outline the responsibilities of states and the international community to protect populations from four specific crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\nR2P requires a call for assistance by the state in distress. Humanitarian intervention can occur without a call for assistance.\nR2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis. Humanitarian intervention lacks such input and its primary objective is to stop ongoing harm.\nR2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not."}

The four basic sources of international law are treaties, custom, court decisions, and general principles.\nIn international law, customary law is a source of international law that derives from custom. Custom is the repeated practice of states that is considered to be binding.\nThe Lotus principle states that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris.\nState practice refers to the actions that states take. These actions can include diplomatic exchanges, military actions, and other activities.\nOpinio juris refers to the belief of states that a rule is legally binding. A rule is considered to be a part of customary law if states act out of a sense of legal obligation based on the rule.\nThe so-called Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris. This means that for a rule to become a part of customary law, states must both practice the rule and believe that the rule is legally binding."}

The principle of sovereign equality, enshrined in Article 2, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter, states that all states are equal in their sovereign rights. This principle is a cornerstone of the United Nations and is reiterated in the charters of many other international organizations.\nHowever, the principle of sovereign equality does not mean that all states are identical. A state's powers, rights, and duties may differ from those of other states. These differences may result from a state's size, population, military power, or economic strength, as well as its historical and cultural background.\nMoreover, some states are members of international organizations that give them additional powers, rights, and duties. For example, the founding members of the United Nations are vested with more powers and authority than non-founding members. The Permanent Five Members of the UN Security Council are in a superior position than the other states in terms of their powers and responsibilities.\nIn conclusion, while the principle of sovereign equality suggests that states are equal in their sovereign rights, there may be other factors that affect the relative power and influence of states. Whether there will be any hierarchy among states is a matter of each international organization to decide."}

This Article requires that the government take positive steps to protect people's right to life.\nThe test was laid down by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Osman v. the United Kingdom. It consists of three parts:\nFirst, there must be a real and imminent risk of death or injury.\nSecond, the risk must have been caused by the use of force by a state agent.\nThird, the state must have known, or ought to have known, that the use of force created a real and imminent risk of death or injury.\nIn other words, the test applies to a situation in which a government's agent uses force, and that force creates a real and imminent risk of death or injury. If that happens, the government has an obligation to protect its people from that risk.\nSOLUTION: To apply the Osman test, you need to figure out if each of the three parts of the test are met.\nThe question tells you that a real and imminent risk of harm can be sufficient to engage a state's positive obligations. So, the first part of the test is met.\nThe second part of the test is also met. The risk must have been caused by the use of force by a state agent.\nThe third part of the test is also met. The state must have known, or ought to have known, that the use of force created a real and imminent risk of death or injury.\nThe Osman test does not include a requirement that the risk must emanate from a state agent.

The Court is based in Strasbourg, France.\nThe Court has considered many cases that raise questions about the relationship between human rights and international law. One of the questions is whether international law, including the rules that make up the body of customary international law, can limit the scope of a human right. The Court has discussed this question in a number of cases, and in 2012, it answered it in the case of Al-Adsani v. United Kingdom.\nIn Al-Adsani, the Court considered whether customary international law, which includes the principle of immunity, could limit the scope of the right to a fair trial. The Court held that immunities were not in conflict with the right to a fair trial. This means that immunity, a rule of customary international law, does not limit the scope of the right to a fair trial."}

So, they are not a source of international law in the sense that they do not create legal norms.\nHowever, GA Resolutions are considered as an important source of evidence of the existence of customary law. So, they reflect the existing customary law."}
{"question": "Do treaties bind third States, ie non-State parties?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Treaties may create only rights for third States"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Treaties create both obligations and rights for third States"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Treaties do no create obligations or rights for third States without their consent"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Treaties do not create any obligations or rights for third States, even when the latter consent."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "Treaties create both obligations and rights for third States. When a treaty is ratified, it binds the parties to the treaty. But the treaty may also create rights and obligations for third States. For example, the United States and Russia are not parties to the Kyoto Protocol. But the protocol obligates parties to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. So, the protocol creates obligations for the United States and Russia to reduce their emissions. At the same time, the protocol creates rights for the United States and Russia to demand that parties who are out of compliance with the protocol reduce their emissions."}

Such acts are often referred to as acts of state.\nAll acts undertaken by state officials are acts jure imperii. These acts include, for example, the execution of a treaty, the enactment of a law, and the execution of a contract.\nAn international organization is an organization created by a treaty. The organization is a separate legal entity, but its states are not bound by the organization's acts. An act undertaken by an international organization is not an act jure imperii.\nA State corporation is a corporation created by a state. The corporation is a separate legal entity, but it is not an organ of the state. An act undertaken by a State corporation is not an act jure imperii.\nAn act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official state capacity. An official state capacity includes, for example, the execution of a treaty, the enactment of a law, and the execution of a contract."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between the formal sources of international law?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Treaties supersede custom"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Custom supersedes treaties"}, {"label": "D", "text": "General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The formal sources of international law are treaties, custom, and general principles of law. The relationship between these sources is a matter of hierarchy: one source may be ranked higher than another.\nThere is a hierarchy among the formal sources of international law. Custom is at the bottom of the hierarchy, treaties are just above custom, and general principles of law are at the top.\nA rule of custom is binding only if it has been accepted by states as a custom. A treaty is binding on the states that have signed it. General principles of law are not binding in the same way that treaties and customs are, but they are considered by courts and scholars in the development of international law.\nSo, treaties supersede custom. A treaty cannot be made in violation of a prior custom. But if a treaty and a custom contradict each other, the treaty will prevail.\nCustom does not supersede treaties. This means that a treaty can be made even if there is no custom on the topic.\nGeneral principles of law do not supersede treaties or customs. This means that when a treaty or custom applies, general principles of law may be used to interpret the treaty or custom, but the treaty or custom remains the controlling rule."}

But the use of force is only authorized under Chapter VII.\nSo, Resolution 678 is broader because it authorized the use of force with respect to any matter threatening the peace and security of the Gulf region."}
{"question": "How can customary law be related to treaty provisions?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Treaties may only codify customary law"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Customary law is a different source of international and it cannot be embodied in treaties"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Treaties may 1) codify customary law, 2) 'crystallise' customary law, 3) lead to the emergence of customary law"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Customary law can emerge only from few multilateral treaties"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Customary law is a source of international law that has developed over time from the consistent practice of states. It is not a treaty.\nA treaty is a formal written agreement between two or more states. It is a source of international law.\nTreaties can codify customary law. This means that a treaty may reflect and make official customary law.\nA treaty can also crystallize customary law. This means that a treaty may record a custom that is already in existence.\nA treaty can also lead to the emergence of customary law. This means that a treaty may help to create a new custom that becomes part of customary law.\nCustomary law cannot emerge only from a few multilateral treaties. This is because customary law is based on the practices of states, not on treaties."}

A legal function is an activity that a legal actor (a court, for example) can perform. In contrast, a legal power is a permission that a legal statue gives to a legal actor.\nFunctional recognition is the act of recognizing a declared state's authority to govern. This can include recognizing the state's territorial boundaries, its government, and its statehood. But functional recognition is not the same as recognizing a state's declared statehood.\nRecognizing a state's declared statehood is a different function. It is the act of acknowledging that a particular entity is a state. This function may include recognizing a state's territorial boundaries, its government, and its statehood. But it does not always include these acts."}

Like other systems, the international society has a structure. This structure can be described in terms of the way that the parts of the system are related to each other.\nThe vertical model of the domestic legal orders is a model for the structure of the international society. Under this model, the parts of the international society are related to each other in a vertical order. In this order, the parts are ranked in a hierarchy, with each part having a different level of authority. The highest level of authority belongs to the most powerful states, which are at the top of the hierarchy.\nThe horizontal model of the domestic legal orders is another model for the structure of the international society. Under this model, the parts of the international society are related to each other in a horizontal order. In this order, the parts are not ranked in a hierarchy. Instead, the parts are equals.\nAn anarchic society is a society that has no governing body. In an anarchic society, there is no authority to enforce the rules. So, the structure of an anarchic society is not a matter of the way that the parts of the society are related to each other.\nThe structure of the international society resembles the structure of the most powerful nations in the world. This means that the parts of the international society are related to each other in the same way that the parts of the most powerful nations are related to each other."}

In order to be incorporated into the domestic sphere, they must first be recognized as criminal offenses under English law.\nThere are no limitations to the incorporation of customary crimes. Once a customary crime is recognized by the UK, it can be prosecuted in its courts.\nCustomary crimes must be contained in a multilateral treaty in order to be automatically incorporated. This means that the UK must be a signatory to the treaty and the treaty must contain the customary crime in order for the crime to be automatically incorporated into English law.\nThe courts may freely incorporate customary crimes into the domestic sphere. This means that the UK courts have the power to apply customary crimes in their courts, even if they are not specifically enumerated in English law.\nThe situation is not clear-cut but an act of parliament would most probably be required. This means that incorporation of customary crimes into English law may require legislation by Parliament."}

Some of the situations where a state has been held to have a positive obligation to protect an individual's rights include:\nWhen the applicant is in the custody of the state: In these cases, the state has a positive obligation to protect the applicant from ill-treatment.\nWhere the state must investigate claims against it: In these cases, the state has a positive obligation to investigate claims that an individual's rights have been violated.\nThe development of a legal framework to protect those within the state: In cases where a state has not yet developed a legal framework to protect an individual's rights, the state has a positive obligation to do so.\nTo provide housing for all those homeless within a state: Providing housing is a positive obligation when a state has the resources to do so and when there is a significant number of homeless individuals within the state.\nSome of the criteria that must be met for a state to have a positive obligation to protect an individual's rights include:\nThe risk of harm must be real and immediate.\nThe state must have knowledge of the risk of harm.\nThe state must be in a position to do something to prevent the harm.\nThe court has emphasized that a state's positive obligation to protect an individual's rights is a continuing obligation. The state must take appropriate steps to protect an individual's rights, and it must do so in a timely manner.\nSOLUTION: To be developed by the European Court of Human Rights as a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect, a situation must meet the criteria for when a state has a positive obligation to protect an individual's rights. Providing housing is not a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect an individual's rights. So, the European Court of Human Rights has not developed housing as a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect."}

Peremptory norms of international law are one type of norm that sets out such obligations. Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties describes them as \"unconditionally binding.\"\nOther types of norms that set out obligations erga omnes include acts of international organizations, decisions of international courts, and treaties that regulate objective regimes."}

According to this theory, a state is a community that receives the recognition of other states.\nIf recognition is necessary for a state to exist, then recognition must be determinative of statehood. That is, the decision of whether to recognize a state must determine whether the state exists.\nOther theories of recognition argue that recognition is not determinative of statehood. For example, the declarative theory of recognition claims that recognition is an expression of a preexisting statehood. According to this theory, a state does not need to be recognized to exist; rather, recognition is a way for other states to acknowledge a state that is already there."}

The ICCPR is one of the few human rights treaties that has a reporting system that is backed up by an enforcement mechanism.\nUnder the ICCPR, states parties are required to report to the United Nations on the measures they have taken to comply with their treaty obligations. The United Nations reviews these reports and may concern itself with any matter related to the ICCPR. If a state party is found to be in violation of the ICCPR, the UN may encourage that state to bring its practices into compliance.\nIn 1966, the United Nations adopted a protocol to the ICCPR that allowed individuals to petition a committee of experts for protection of their human rights. The committee can examine the petition and, if it finds that the petitioner has been subjected to a violation of human rights, it may make recommendations to the state.\nJudgment of an international tribunal is not correct. As of 2021, there is no international tribunal that has the power to hear cases brought by individuals alleging violations of the ICCPR."}

The question is whether piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction.\nThe answer is B.\nPiracy jure gentium is a violation of the law of nations, which is a part of the jus gentium, or the law of nations. Jus gentium is based on the consent of nations and is designed to regulate the relationships among nations and their individuals. Because piracy jure gentium is a violation of the law of nations, it is subject to universal jurisdiction."}

The UNSC has the power to authorise the use of force by states to settle disputes and maintain international peace and security.\nThe term \"implied authorisation\" refers to situations in which the UNSC does not explicitly authorise the use of force, but its actions can be interpreted as giving permission to use force. There are several ways in which the UNSC may give an \"implied authorisation\" for the use of force. For example, if the UNSC forewarns a state that it may use force, this can be seen as giving permission to use force."}

It is based on the right to self-defense by more than one nation acting in concert.\nThe term collective security was first used in the United Nations Charter. Today, collective security is still the basic principle of the United Nations' approach to security.\nThe UN Charter gives the Security Council the right to authorize action to maintain peace. The Council can take military and economic measures against any country that violates the UN Charter.

The jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts are also common to international tribunals.\nNational courts have jurisdiction, or power, over the matters that are before them. The same is true of international tribunals. Like national courts, international tribunals have the power to hear and decide the cases that are before them.\nThe jurisdiction of international tribunals is regulated by the same principles that apply to national courts. Those principles include the principles of jurisdiction, admissibility, and provisional measures.\nJurisdiction refers to the power of a court to hear and decide a case. The principle of jurisdiction requires that international tribunals have a clear and specific jurisdictional basis for each case they hear.\nAdmissibility refers to the power of a court to hear a case that is brought before it. The principle of admissibility requires that international tribunals have the power to hear cases that are within their jurisdictional basis.\nProvisional measures are temporary measures that a court can order before a final decision is reached. The principle of provisional measures allows international tribunals to order provisional measures to protect the rights of parties to a case."}

For example, the right of free speech is an individual right, but the right to form a political party is a collective right.\nSome groups have a natural choice mechanism that is better suited to the pursuit of their collective interests. For example, business corporations have a hierarchical structure that allows them to make effective decisions."}

This means that states must be willing to make concessions and compromises in order to reach a mutually acceptable solution.\nStates are also under an obligation to find a solution of the dispute whenever they conduct negotiations. This obligation to make a reasonable effort to find a solution is known as the obligation to negotiate in good faith.\nStates are not obligated to agree to a solution, but they are obligated to negotiate in a way that shows they are trying to reach an agreement.\nStates are not obligated to inform the UN Secretary-General about the progress of their negotiations."}

The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction on the State which has an effective link with the harmful conduct.\nThe effective link with the harmful conduct is usually based on some connection between the State and the harm caused by the conduct. The most common connection is that the conduct was directed by an agent of the State or was committed by a person whose actions were inspired or encouraged by the State.\nThe State of the victim is one of the States that can use the effects doctrine to assert jurisdiction over criminal conduct. The State of the victim is the state where the victim is a national.\nThe territorial link to the conduct is established when the conduct occurs within the territory of the State asserting jurisdiction. This link is established regardless of the nationality of the victim or the perpetrator.\nThe nationality link to the offender is one of the links that can be used to assert jurisdiction using the effects doctrine. This link is established when the perpetrator is a national of the State asserting jurisdiction."}

To determine whether a custom is a binding source of law, the following three criteria must be met:\n1. The custom must have been consistently followed.\n2. The custom must have been intentionally adopted.\n3. The custom must be recognised and given effect by the courts.\nIf all three criteria are met, the custom becomes a binding source of law.\nParliament can enhance the power of custom by passing implementing legislation. Such legislation can make clear that a particular custom is to be followed in a particular area. But even without implementing legislation, courts may bring a custom into the domestic sphere.\nThe fundamental prerequisite for incorporating custom under English law is that the custom must first be recognised by Parliament. This recognition is given through the passage of implementing legislation.\nThe courts will not incorporate a custom that is in conflict with existing legislation. So, if a custom is inconsistent with an Act of Parliament, the custom will not be incorporated."}

Instead, international law permitted the use of armed force, albeit with varying restrictions.\nThe only absolute prohibition on the use of armed force under international law before the United Nations Charter was the prohibition on the use of force in violation of customary international law. This prohibition was violated, for example, by Germany's use of armed force in the invasion of Poland in 1939."}

This distinction is important because the rules that govern the two types of action are different.\nAn act jure imperii is an act undertaken in the sovereign capacity. These acts are taken in the name of the state and are therefore considered to be acts of the state.\nAn act jure gestionis is an act undertaken in the private capacity. These acts are taken in the name of the state, but they are considered to be acts of the state officials who are conducting the transaction.\nAll purchases by the state are acts jure gestionis. When a state purchases something, it is considered to be conduct undertaken by the state officials who are making the purchase.\nAll acts undertaken by state corporations are acts jure gestionis. State corporations are creations of states. When a state creates a corporation, the corporation is a separate entity from the state. But the corporation is still considered to be conduct undertaken by state officials in their private capacity.\nAll conduct undertaken by government officials in their free time is considered jure gestionis. Conduct that is not undertaken as part of an official state function is not an act jure gestionis."}

To be a treaty, an agreement must meet three criteria: (1) it must be an agreement, (2) it must be between states, and (3) it must be an agreement with international legal effect. The UDHR does not meet the criteria to be a treaty.\nA resolution is a document that is adopted by a meetings of the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, or the Trusteeship Council. The UDHR is a resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly.\nA declaration is a document that sets out the policies or intentions of one or more states.

This principle is used in international law to establish that treaties are binding on the parties that enter into them.\nThe purpose of a treaty is determined by its objects. The objects of a treaty are the matters that the treaty was designed to accomplish. Treaties can have many objects. An treaty may have objects that are concrete and particular, or it may have objects that are more general and open-ended.\nTreaties can also have purposes that are more general. The purpose of a treaty is not necessarily the same as its objects. The purpose of a treaty may be to establish a general framework of relations between the parties, for example.\nTreaties can also have good faith as their purpose. Good faith is a subjective concept. It is not possible to define it in an absolute way. But it is possible to describe some of the things that make a party's conduct a violation of the parties' obligation of good faith. A party's obligation of good faith is not limited to the obligations of the parties under the treaty. It also includes the obligation to refrain from conduct that would undermine the treaty.\nSome provisions of a treaty may be more important than others. A party to a treaty must not violate the most important provisions of the treaty. This principle does not describe the objects of the treaty or the purpose of the treaty. This principle describes what a party must do to comply with the treaty."}

These principles are so fundamental that they can be said to form the bedrock of international law.\nThere are several ways in which a norm can become part of jus cogens. One way is for a principle to be specifically identified as a peremptory norm, or a norm from which no derogation is permitted. Another way is for a principle to be so widely accepted by the international community as to be considered a part of jus cogens.\nThe criteria for a norm to be a part of jus cogens include that the norm be a general principle of law, that the norm be accepted by the international community as a whole, and that the norm be considered to be a fundamental principle.\nThe Security Council is a part of the United Nations, a family of organizations set up to maintain peace and security.

This is because such abduction is illegal and gives rise to the abductor's liability. To determine what a court should do in response to such abduction, it is necessary to consider the nature of the proceedings.\nIf the proceedings are in respect of an offence, the court may stay the proceedings. This is because the court may take into account the nature of the conduct that led to the trial, and the interests of justice may require a stay.\nIf the proceedings are not in respect of an offence, the court may not stay the proceedings. This is because the court is not concerned with the enforcement of criminal law. The court is concerned with the enforcement of civil law.\nThe courts may, but will seldom, stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction. This is because the court will consider the nature of the conduct that led to the trial. If the conduct was an extra-territorial abduction, the court may stay the proceedings. But the court will only do this in seldom cases. This is because the court will also consider whether the trial is in the interests of justice. An extra-territorial abduction may be an important factor in this consideration. But the court will also need to consider other factors."}

To be a treaty, a document must meet the following criteria: it must be an agreement between states, it must be intended to be legal, and it must be capable of being entered into by states in the international community.\nThere is no requirement that treaties assume a particular form.

So, we need to look for general principles of international law recognized by international courts and tribunals.\nArticle 38 of the ICJ Statute provides that the court shall apply international law, including general principles. It goes on to describe the sources the court may look to in finding international law, including:\nthe general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\nspecial agreements concluded between the parties;\nsubsequent practice of the parties;\nand, in the absence of any of the foregoing, the nature of the legal dispute.\nThe court may also refer to its own previous decisions.\nThe first step in applying international law is to identify the relevant sources. The second step is to find the principles within those sources. The test for whether a principle has been accepted as part of international law is whether it is widely recognized by states.\nA principle is not part of international law if it is accepted only by a small number of states or by states that are not considered to be civilized nations. For example, some states allow the execution of juveniles. This principle is not part of international law because it is not widely accepted.\nA principle is not part of international law if it is accepted only by certain groups within the international community. For example, the notion of customary international law is based on state practice. A practice is part of customary international law only if a significant number of states follow it.\nA principle may be part of international law to the extent that some states follow it. However, for a principle to be widely recognized as part of international law, it must be followed by a significant number of states.\nA principle may be part of international law in one context but not in another. For example, the principle of self-defense is recognized in the context of the use of force in international law. But the principle is not recognized in the context of the use of force in domestic law."}

Under this law, an \"injured State\" is a State that has been damaged by the conduct of another State.\nThe other three answer choices are incorrect. A State is not injured in cases of a violation of a peremptory norm of international law. And a State is not injured simply by acknowledging the existence of internationally wrongful conduct, or owing to the breach of an obligation that was owed to it individually or to a group of States that includes that State.\nA State is injured in cases of a violation of a peremptory norm of international law if the violation causes the State to be directly and seriously injured.

These decisions and recommendations, when adopted in accordance with the UN Charter, prevail over any other agreements.\nThe only limit to the application of Article 103 is the principle of customary international law, which includes the concept of jus cogens. Jus cogens norms are so fundamental that they cannot be ignored by national courts. As a result, if a national court is faced with a conflict between a Security Council resolution and a jus cogens norm, the jus cogens norm would prevail."}

These obligations are called international obligations.\nA country's domestic law is different from its international obligations. In some cases, a country's domestic law may be different from its international obligations. When this happens, international law prevails over domestic law.
