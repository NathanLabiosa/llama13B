A disjunctive syllogism is valid when the following condition is met: if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.\nThe major premise of a disjunctive syllogism includes two or more alternatives. These alternatives describe the possible states of affairs that exist or may come to exist. The minor premise links one or more alternatives to a specific outcome.\nThe following examples are valid disjunctive syllogisms:\nMark is a student, or Mark is a farmer.\nMark is a student.\nSo, Mark is not a farmer.\nIt is late, or the Jones are coming over.\nIt is late.\nSo, the Jones are not coming over.\nThe following examples are not valid disjunctive syllogisms:\nMark is a student, or Mark is a farmer.\nMark is a student.\nSo, Mark is a farmer.\nIt is late, or the Jones are coming over.\nIt is not late.\nSo, the Jones are coming over.\nThe major premise of a valid disjunctive syllogism may include up to n alternatives, where n is the number of minor premises.\nEach alternative in the major premise can be linked to a separate minor premise and conclusion.\nSOLUTION: A major premise that includes two or more alternatives leads to one or more disjunctive syllogisms.

Some fallacies occur when the reasoning is based on a false premise. Other fallacies occur when the reasoning is based on a valid premise, but the reasoning is not correct.\nPoisoning the well is a fallacy that occurs when a source of evidence is unfairly discredited. This type of fallacy is a type of ad hominem fallacy, which is a fallacy that criticizes the source of the evidence, rather than the evidence itself.\nFor example, imagine that a candidate is running for office, and her opponent says, \"Her family made its money from a toxic waste dump. They've been polluting the environment for years. Would you really trust her to protect the environment?\" In this case, the opponent is poisoning the well. She is unfairly discrediting the candidate's family and the company they founded. By doing so, she is trying to make the candidate's evidence of her environmental policies less credible."}

This is known as the fallacy of division.\nSuppose you argue that a politician is untrustworthy. By doing this, you have made a claim about the politician. But this claim can be flawed if you are making a claim about a part of the politician (such as their hair) instead of the politician as a whole.\nThere are many ways in which this fallacy can occur. For example, you might argue that a vegetable is not nutritious. This is a valid claim. But it is not necessarily true that each part of the vegetable is not nutritious.\nAnother way in which this fallacy can occur is by failing to consider the different functions of different parts of an object. A paperclip's legs are not the same as its body. The legs of the paperclip can be dipped in glue, but it would not be useful to do this with the body of the paperclip.\nSOLUTION: Division is a type of fallacy. This type of fallacy occurs when an argument is based on the assumption that it is true for each part of an object that it is true for the object as a whole.\nThe argument in the text commits the fallacy of division. The argument concludes that the safety of the wind turbine is not affected by the presence of the snow. This is a claim about each part of the wind turbine. But the safety of the wind turbine as a whole is not the same as the safety of each part of the wind turbine."}

This is fallacious because a lack of evidence for a claim does not prove that the claim is true.\nImagine that a student argues that a new solar panel installation will not produce energy on cloudy days. The student's teacher points out that the student has no evidence for this claim. The student then replies, \"Well, I don't have any evidence that the solar panels won't work on cloudy days, but that's not proof that they will work.\"\nThe student is correct that a lack of evidence is not proof that the solar panels will work on cloudy days. But it is also not proof that they will not work. So, appealing to ignorance is a fallacy.\nSOLUTION: The burden of proof is on the person making a claim. This means that, if you make a claim, you need to provide evidence for your claim. If you cannot provide evidence for your claim, your claim is usually considered false.\nSo, the lack of evidence for a claim does not prove that the claim is true. But it does make it more likely that the claim is false. And, as the burden of proof is on the person making the claim, a lack of evidence for a claim makes it more likely that the claim will be false."}

And if the group were to continue to show you graphic images every time they wanted to persuade you of something, the appeal to pity could become manipulative.\nSOLUTION: The question asks you to identify the type of appeal to emotion that Polonius is making. appeal to pity is an appeal to emotion.

For example, the author may argue that you should choose between two options, without considering that you may be able to do something else.\nThis failure to consider alternatives that are not mutually exclusive can happen in many ways. One way it can happen is by using circular reasoning. Circular reasoning is when an argument supports its own claims. For example, an argument might argue that a certain policy is needed by claiming that a certain outcome would happen if the policy were in place, and then arguing that this outcome would happen if the policy were in place.\nAnother way that a failure to consider alternatives that are not mutually exclusive can happen is by using a false dilemma. A false dilemma is when an argument presents only two options when there are other options available.

This can be a powerful tool for solving problems, but it can also lead to errors in thinking.\nOne of the steps in the analogy process involves determining what was used in the analogy. This is sometimes called \" reasoning by sign.\" If an argument uses a sign-a word, symbol, or expression-to stand for something else, the analogy process requires that you figure out what that sign represents.\nThe false sign fallacy is a type of fallacy that involves misusing a sign. It occurs when the sign is not used to represent its intended meaning.\nSOLUTION: The false sign fallacy is committed when a sign is misused to stand for something it is not intended to represent. This can happen in many different ways. For example, it might happen when an author uses a sign with the wrong meaning, or when an author uses a sign that is supposed to represent one thing to instead represent something else.\nThe other types of fallacies are not concerned with misusing signs."}

It is not based on emotion or personal experience. A classification has two parts: the criteria and the things that meet the criteria. The criteria tell you what to look for. The things that meet the criteria are the subjects of the classification.\nClassifications can have three types of problems:\n1. The criteria are not clear.\n2. The things that meet the criteria are not evaluated.\n3. The conclusion is not drawn from the criteria and the things that meet the criteria.\nArguing that what is true of a few members of a class is true of all members of the class is a type of error in classification. This error is called a generalization. Generalizations can be correct or incorrect.\nIf the criteria specify that the things in the classification must be original, then it is correct to argue that what is true of a few original members of a class is true of all members of the class.\nIf the criteria do not mention originality, then it is not correct to argue that what is true of a few members of a class is true of all members of the class.\nDrawing a conclusion by applying irrelevant criteria to a subject is a type of error in classification. This error is called a false application of criteria.\nBeing original is not a relevant criterion for every classification. So, it is incorrect to argue that something must be good because it is new, or must be bad because it is old.\nLook at the criteria. Evaluate the things that meet the criteria. Use the criteria to draw a conclusion.\nSubstituting individual stories for a larger sample as support for a claim is a type of error in classification. This error is called a false cause.\nA larger sample is a group of things that is larger than a single thing. Evaluating a larger sample can be a better way to make predictions about things that meet the criteria.\nIf a claim is based on a small number of things, it may be unreliable. The smaller the number of things, the less reliable the claim is."}
{"question": "When someone tries to support a proposition with information that really has nothing to do with the claim being made, that person has probably committed which of the following fallacies?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "straw person"}, {"label": "B", "text": "genetic fallacy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "irrelevant conclusion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "ignoratio elenchi"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Fallacies are arguments that are used to support a proposition, but that contain elements that are incorrect, illogical, or irrelevant. Fallacies can be used to prove just about anything.\nOne type of fallacy is a slippery slope argument. A slippery slope argument assumes that one event will inevitably lead to a chain of events, each of which is supposed to be bad.\nFor example: \"If we allow gay couples to marry, next we'll have to allow brothers and sisters to marry. Then, people will want to marry their pets. This is how it starts.\"\nThis argument is a fallacy because it assumes that gay marriage is the first step in a series of events that will lead to marriages with brothers and sisters and marriages with pets. That may be true, but that is not the point. The point is whether gay couples should be allowed to marry.\nAnother type of fallacy is a straw person. A straw person is a misrepresentation of an opponent's argument.\nFor example: \"Those who support the death penalty are just crazy people who get pleasure out of watching people be executed.\"\nThis argument is a fallacy because it misrepresents the argument for the death penalty. Nobody is arguing that people get pleasure out of watching executions. The argument is about whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for certain crimes.\nYet another type of fallacy is an ad hominem attack. An ad hominem attack is a personal attack against an opponent, rather than an attack against the opponent's argument.\nFor example: \"You are wrong because you are a convicted felon. I don't trust anything that comes out of your mouth.\"\nThis argument is a fallacy because it is not an attack on the argument that was made. Instead, it is a personal attack against the opponent.\nAn irrelevant conclusion is a conclusion that is not supported by the evidence.\nFor example: \"Wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle is a good idea. Everyone should wear a helmet. This will help prevent head injuries.\"\nThis argument is an irrelevant conclusion because it is not supported by the evidence. The evidence may support the claim that helmets are effective at preventing head injuries, but it does not support the claim that everyone should wear a helmet.\nAn ignoratio elenchi is an argument that may be correct, but it does not address the claim that was made.\nFor example: \"The earth is old. We can see this from the number of fossils that have been found. The earth is also getting older. This can be seen in the number of fossils that are found each year.\"\nThis argument is an ignoratio elenchi because it may be correct, but it does not address the claim that the earth is old.\nSOLUTION: When someone tries to support a proposition with information that really has nothing to do with the claim being made, that person has probably committed an irrelevant conclusion fallacy."}

A criteria is a principle or standard that is used to evaluate something.\nWhen criteria are not based on observable evidence, they can lead to errors. The natural law fallacy is a specific type of error that occurs when criteria are misused.\nThe natural law fallacy occurs when criteria that are based on non-observables are used to make decements. Non-observables are things that cannot be observed.\nAn example of the natural law fallacy is the idea that certain foods are \"bad\" because they are associated with negative outcomes. For example, it is believed by some that eating cherries can help prevent gout attacks. This belief is based on the idea that certain foods can cause certain health outcomes.\nThis belief is an example of the natural law fallacy. Cherries do not cause gout. But if you eat a lot of cherries and also eat a lot of other foods that are bad for your health, you may be more likely to have a gout attack.\nAnother example of the natural law fallacy is the idea that certain personality traits are \"bad.\" For example, it is believed by some that being self-centered is a negative character trait. This belief is based on the idea that certain personality traits can cause certain outcomes.\nThis belief is an example of the natural law fallacy.

This happens when a speaker attempts to undermine an argument by pointing out that the speaker's opponent is hypocritical. For example, imagine that a politician is arguing for stricter environmental regulations. Their opponent responds by pointing out that the politician flew in a private jet to get to the debate. The opponent is using a tu quoque fallacy to undermine the politician's argument.\nThere are many ways to commit a tu quoque fallacy. Here are some examples:\nIf an opponent is arguing that a particular policy is needed, you can respond with a tu quoque fallacy by pointing out that the opponent does not live up to that policy. For example, if an opponent is arguing that a community should pass a ban on plastic bags, you could respond by pointing out that the opponent uses plastic bags.\nIf an opponent is arguing that a particular position is based on emotion, you can respond with a tu quoque fallacy by pointing out that the opponent is also emotionally invested in their position. For example, if a student is arguing that a paper on a controversial topic should get a lower grade because the student's emotions got in the way of writing a good paper, you could respond by pointing out that the student is emotionally invested in getting a higher grade.\nIf an opponent is arguing that a particular position is based on a particular experience, you can respond with a tu quoque fallacy by pointing out that the opponent does not have that experience. For example, if a lawyer is arguing that a particular legal decision was wrong because the lawyer has seen similar cases get different decisions, you could respond by pointing out that the lawyer has not been the victim of police brutality.\nIf an opponent is arguing that a particular position is based on a particular identity, you can respond with a tu quoque fallacy by pointing out that the opponent does not have that identity. For example, if a man is arguing that women should not be allowed to vote, you could respond by pointing out that the man is not a woman.\nSOLUTION: A tu quoque fallacy occurs when a speaker attempts to undermine an argument by pointing out that the speaker's opponent is hypocritical.

Fallacies have the following three properties:\n1. Fallacies contain a mistake in reasoning.\n2. Fallacies are used to support a conclusion.\n3. Fallacies are not evidence.\nFallacies are common. They are used by people who are trying to convince others of something. But they are not used in good arguments.\nThere are many types of fallacies. One type of fallacy is the one that involves reasoning that determines the conclusion one wants first, then accepts only evidence that supports that conclusion, or interprets all evidence as support for that conclusion. This type of fallacy is called the fallacy of the desired outcome.\nAnother type of fallacy is the one that involves assuming that what is true in one case is also true in another case, without considering the differences between the two cases. This type of fallacy is called the fallacy of plurium interrogationum.\nThe fallacy of plurium interrogationum occurs when someone asks questions that assume a certain answer. For example:\nIf each person at the party had four toes, then the party had 20 toes.\nIt is not clear if the party had 20 toes. All that is known is that each person at the party had four toes.\nSo, the fallacy of plurium interrogationum occurs when someone asks questions that assume a certain answer, and then uses those questions to support a conclusion.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether a argument falls into the fallacy of plurium interrogationum, look for questions that assume a certain answer. Then, look at the answers that are given. Accept only the answers that support the conclusion.\nThe argument in the question falls into the fallacy of plurium interrogationum.

One way is to use an argument that is not relevant to the topic at hand. Another way is to use evidence that is not relevant to the claim you are making.\nThe \"ignorance of refutation\" fallacy is a type of fallacy that occurs when someone rejects a claim as false without knowing how to refute it. This fallacy is also known as the \"you too\" fallacy.\nHere is an example of the \"you too\" fallacy:\nSuppose that a scientist is presenting evidence that a certain chemical is harmful. An industry executive responds by saying, \"Well, you too are affiliated with an organization that takes money from companies that make chemicals.\"\nIn this case, the executive is using a \"you too\" fallacy. The scientist's affiliation has no bearing on the evidence for the harmful effects of the chemical.\nThe \"appeal to compassion\" fallacy is a type of fallacy that occurs when someone appeals to pity rather than to reason. This type of fallacy is not about being against pity or emotional appeals. It is about the fallacy of using emotional appeals instead of evidence to make a point.\nHere is an example of the appeal to compassion fallacy:\nImagine that the president of a country is advocating for a war. A mother whose son is in the military tells the president, \"Please, I ask you to consider the families of the soldiers who are fighting. Please listen to us.\"\nIn this case, the mother is making an appeal to compassion. Her emotional appeal is not based on evidence that the war is necessary.\nThe \"argument against the person\" fallacy is a type of fallacy in which a claim is made against someone instead of arguing against the claim itself. This type of fallacy is also called an ad hominem attack.\nHere is an example of an argument against the person fallacy:\nSuppose that a politician is presenting an argument for lower taxes. An opposing politician says, \"But you have a history of being in favor of the wealthy.

A false dilemma is a type of logical fallacy in which one of the options is secretly limited or altered in some way.\nThe fallacy lies in the fact that the only options given are to be violent or nonviolent. This is a false dilemma because there are other options.\nAn ad hominem attack is a type of argument in which an argument is rejected on the basis of some feature of the person presenting the argument. This feature could be something about the person's appearance, life, or character.\nThe argument is not really about beating one's wife. So, attacking the person is not the correct answer.\nPrejudicial language refers to language that prejudices an audience against someone or something. It is not logical and is not useful for arguing.\nThe language in the question is prejudicial. It assumes that the person asked the question is violent. This is not a fair assumption. So, the question is written in a way that prejudices the audience against the person asked.\nAn appeal to force is an argument in which an opponent is beaten or forced to accept a claim. This argument is fallacious because beating someone is not a way to show that a claim is true.\nThe question does not appeal to force. So, the question is not using this type of fallacy."}

Often, people say that one event is the cause of another event. For example, people may say that eating ice cream is the cause of feeling cold, or that playing video games is the cause of not doing homework.\nThese are cases of putting an event into a category. Classifying events as causes of other events is a way of describing how events relate to each other. But, it is important to be careful when assigning causes to events.\nOne way to describe a cause is in terms of a simple cause. A simple cause is a cause that is not itself the result of any other event.\nA complex cause is a cause that is the result of other events.\nA complex cause is not a simple cause. So, a complex cause is not a valid answer for the simple cause of an event.\nA hasty generalization is a conclusion that is not justified by the evidence.\nA hasty generalization happens when you make a judgment about a group of people or things based on too little evidence.\nMaking a conclusion about a specific event based on a hasty generalization is a fallacy.\nPost hoc is a fallacy that happens when you conclude that one event is the cause of another event because the first event happened before the second event.\nPost hoc means \"after this.\" This fallacy is called post hoc because it is based on the assumption that because one event followed another, the first event must have caused the second event.\nA post hoc fallacy is a type of correlation does not imply causation fallacy.\nDivision is a fallacy that happens when you conclude that a specific event is the cause of a general trend because the event happens within the trend.\nDivision is a form of the false cause fallacy. This type of fallacy is called division because it is based on the assumption that the part caused the whole."}

However, no claim is self-evident. No matter how clear a claim may seem, some people will not accept it.\nArguing that a claim is true based only on evidence that an authority figure accepts the claim is a form of arguing based on authority. This type of argument is not a fallacy, but it can be. A fallacy of this type is committed when the authority figure is not an expert on the subject at hand.\nArguing a claim should be accepted based only on evidence that unidentified authorities accept it is a fallacy. The fallacy lies in the unidentified authorities. These authorities could be anyone. They could be experts, but they could also be people with no expertise in the subject.\nArguing that a claim should be accepted based on evidence that is not presented, but is asserted to be well known or obvious is a fallacy. Claims that are well known or obvious do not need to be argued. They do not need evidence.\nArguing someone should accept a claim based only on the evidence that he or she has the favorable characteristics to understand the truth of the claim is a fallacy.
