{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Since the foundations of the American commonwealth were laid in colonial times over 300 years ago, vigorous complaint and more or less bitter persecution have been aimed at newcomers to our shores. Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands.

The act is described as an example of nativism.\nNativism is a term that describes a philosophy that believes in the supremacy of native-born people. This can include hostility to immigrants and their descendants.\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 changed the previous immigration law that had been in effect since 1924. The new law removed race as a basis for exclusion from immigration. This was a major change: prior to 1965, the immigration laws of the United States had been designed to exclude people of color.\nThe quotation discusses the 1965 law in the context of a history of nativism in the United States. The quotation refers to the 1965 law as an example of nativism. The law was designed to restrict immigration from certain parts of the world, mainly Africa and Asia. This was a major change from the previous immigration law. Under the previous law, countries were not assigned immigration quotas. Instead, immigration from each country was limited to 10% of the number of people from that country who had already immigrated to the United States. The 1965 law changed this. It set country-specific quotas. This means that immigration from each country was limited to a specific number of people. This change was significant because it began the process of opening the borders to immigrants from other parts of the world."}

At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nOne of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative.

They believed that the government should tax citizens heavily, and should regulate businesses in order to help the economy recover.

Some people feared that the interests of ordinary people were being ignored by the wealthy and the powerful. Others were concerned about the effects of industrialization on the environment. Many people were also troubled by the effects of monopolies and trusts on competition and innovation.\nIn response to these concerns, a group of reformers began to work to restore democracy to the United States.

Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance.

Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence.

It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Christopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The passage discusses the Spanish conquest of the Americas and its impact on the development of rights discourse.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage. The Radical Republicans believed that the plan was too lenient and did not go far enough in ensuring that freed slaves could vote. They wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate. Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight. The Radical Republicans were angered by Lincoln's decision to bypass Congress and issue the proclamation on his own. They felt that he had no authority to make such an important decision without the consent of Congress. Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate. Johnson was a conservative Democrat, and the Radical Republicans in the Senate did not think he was a suitable choice for vice president. They were concerned that he would not be loyal to Lincoln or to the Radical Republicans' Reconstruction plans."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nThe man who mounted the steps of the Capitol, March 4, 1801, to claim the place of an equal between Pitt and Bonaparte, possessed a character which showed itself in acts; but person and manner can be known only by contemporaries, and the liveliest description was worth less than a moment of personal contact. Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and \"The Palace\" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied.\"\n\u2014Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889\nAs the great-grandson of President John Adams, the historian Henry Adams might have been expected to be which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Critical of the policies of Thomas Jefferson"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Supportive of the policies of Thomas Jefferson"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Critical of the Constitutional Convention"}, {"label": "D", "text": "More interested in the French and Indian War"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Henry Adams was the great-grandson of President John Adams.
