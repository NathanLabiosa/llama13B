One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds.

What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "observation and induction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ancient textual authority"}, {"label": "C", "text": "experimentation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "deduction from first principles"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: First, observe that a sphere is the most perfect of all shapes. It is a complete whole that does not require any other shape to complete it. A sphere is also the most capacious shape, which makes it well suited to contain and preserve things.\nAdditionally, all the celestial bodies, including the sun, moon, and planets, appear spherical. Finally, everything in nature seems to strive to take the shape of a sphere.\nOn the other hand, pressing in from all sides causes a sphere to be formed. This happens when a ball is dropped from a height, when a snowball is formed, or when a planet takes shape under its own gravity.\nSo, from observation and induction, we can conclude that the earth is spherical.\nThen, observe that the earth is the only sphere in the universe whose entire surface is covered by water. But water seeks the level above or below it. So, the earth is being carried down by water. This means that the earth is also constantly moving.\nNow, deduction from first principles means using basic assumptions to come to a conclusion. From the basic assumptions that the earth is spherical and that it is in the center of the universe, Copernicus deduced that the earth is at rest.\nExperimentation involves designing and conducting experiments to observe how objects or organisms behave. The underlined part of the passage explains why experimentation was not needed to determine whether the earth is spherical.\nAncient textual authority refers to the idea that the ideas of ancient writers are so fundamental that they should be accepted without question. The passage does not use ancient textual authority to support the claims about the spherical shape of the earth."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nAccording to Huizinga, Erasmus's legacy was more significant than that of earlier humanists because", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "he had more support from the Church"}, {"label": "B", "text": "he wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "he wrote exclusively about religious matters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Huizinga's argument is that Erasmus made the classical spirit current among the people. He did this by writing in a language that the masses could understand. So, the fact that Erasmus wrote in Latin, a language that was not understood by the masses, does not detract from the significance of his legacy.\nBefore Erasmus, humanists had limited their knowledge of classical culture to a few scholars. Erasmus made the classical spirit more accessible to a wider audience. By doing so, he democratized culture. This was a revolutionary idea in the late middle ages."}

Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following Polish thinkers was most likely the person whose ideas convinced Galileo to have written the statement above?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nicolaus Copernicus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Johannes Kepler"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Galileo Galilei"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Josef Pilsudski"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Galileo Galilei's statement above describes the discovery of the Medicean planets, which are the moons of Jupiter.

I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the trade of locksmith; an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.\nThe great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light labor?\n\u2014Charles Fourier, On Education, 1838\nMany in Fourier's circles advocated for universal male suffrage, which was propagated most by which of the following groups?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Luddites"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Liberals"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Benthamites"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chartists"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The Luddites were a group of English textile workers who protested against the use of labor-saving machinery.

As described in the passage, liberalism holds that government should be based on the principle of protecting individual freedom. This means that government should prevent any one person or group from infringing on the freedom of others.\nAccording to the passage, liberalism assumes that people are best able to take care of their own needs. Liberalism also assumes that people are free to make their own choices, and that they bear the consequences of those choices.\nThe first step in any effort to help the poor, Spencer believed, was to let them learn the value of work and the importance of saving. The poor needed to be given the chance to experience the benefits of their own industry.\nSpencer believed that poverty was not caused by a lack of resources. Instead, he thought, poverty was caused by the choices people made. People who were poor had made poor choices, and the poor were poor because of the choices they had made.\nSpencer believed that the way to help the poor was to change the incentives they faced. He believed that people needed to be given an incentive to work and to save.\nSocialism, on the other hand, is a political philosophy that seeks to reduce inequalities in wealth and power. Socialists believe that the accumulation of wealth by individuals or businesses is likely to lead to social inequality. Socialists advocate for collective ownership of the means of production, and they believe that the state should distribute resources more evenly.\nAnarchism is a political philosophy that advocates for the elimination of all government.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Neoplatonism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Antitrinitarianism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pietism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rationalism"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Erasmus is known for his emphasis on education and the importance of learning for everyone, not just the elite. His work on the Adagia was part of this effort to promote education and to help people improve their writing and thinking. The passage suggests that Erasmus's humanism was different from the humanism of the Southern Renaissance in that it was more inclusive. Erasmus's humanism reached a wider circle of people than the humanism of the Southern Renaissance, which was exclusive and only for the elite.\nThe Southern Renaissance humanists were interested in rediscovering the wisdom of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

The British had been addicted to opium, and their government had implemented the British Corn Laws to protect their agriculture from competition from less expensive grain imported from places like China. The Corn Laws led to a reduction in the amount of grain that British merchants could sell abroad. As a result, British merchants began to smuggle opium into China. When the Chinese government tried to stop the smuggling, the British fought back in the First Opium War.

The Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, the anthropometric operations of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, the courses of lectures in the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, the collections in the Jardin de Plantes, the facilities for original work in the \u00e9coles de Medicine, and the hospitals give to the comparative anatomist and biologist abundant employment.\"\nIt can be inferred from the text that at the time of the Paris Exposition, the scientific community was changing due to the development of new, specialized fields."}

Economic determinism is the idea that social and historical change is determined by economic conditions.\nThe Communist Manifesto is based on the idea that class struggle is the driving force of history.

When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nNever were talents of the highest genius of the most exalted kind, more profusely bestowed upon a human being. The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following quote.\nI had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following conclusions drawn in part from the observations above was the most revolutionary over time?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "There were four smaller stars that seemed to move around Jupiter."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Earth is not the center of the universe."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The heavens are occupied by bodies revolving around each other rather than by God alone."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Earth is but one tiny planet in an infinite universe or even multiverse."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A conclusion is a judgment drawn from observations.

Before Galileo, people believed that the Earth was the center of the universe. This belief was based on ancient observations and on the idea that the Earth was the center of the world.\nGalileo's observation that the Medicean planets moved around Jupiter was the first evidence that planets moved around the sun, not around the Earth. This was a major change in thinking.\nBefore Galileo's observation, it was believed that the planets moved around the Earth. This belief was based on ancient observations.
