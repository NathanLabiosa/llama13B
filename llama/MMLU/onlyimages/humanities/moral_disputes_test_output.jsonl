Censoring speech that is possibly true violates this duty, which in turn violates human dignity.\nCensoring speech that is possibly true is a failure of a prima facie duty of honesty. A prima facie duty is a duty that is in force until it is outweighed by some other consideration. It is a duty to tell the truth. If the government censors speech that is possibly true, it is failing to tell the truth, which is a violation of its prima facie duty of honesty.\nThinking that you are infallible is a trap that can lead to disaster. It is a sign of a lack of critical self-reflection. If the government is censoring speech that is possibly true, it is asserting that it is infallible.\nCensoring speech that is possibly true is a risk worth taking if the speech is dangerous enough. The question tells you that it is possible that the speech is true. The question does not tell you that the speech is dangerous. So, the fact that the speech is possibly true is a reason to reject censorship."}

It discusses what West is criticizing feminist rhetoric for. It is not discussing what feminist rhetoric has done.\nWest is not arguing that feminist rhetoric has obscured the harms of consensual sex. He is not arguing that feminist rhetoric has led to the acknowledgement of the harms of consensual sex. He is not arguing that feminist rhetoric has equated all sex with nonconsensual sex. He is arguing that feminist rhetoric has led to the widespread failure to acknowledge a distinction between what is good and what is noncoercive."}
{"question": " According to Mill, the value of a particular pleasure depends on", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "its quantity alone."}, {"label": "B", "text": "its quality alone."}, {"label": "C", "text": "both its quantity and its quality."}, {"label": "D", "text": "neither its quantity nor its quality."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Mill argued that the value of a particular pleasure depends on both its quantity and quality. He called these two components of value the \"intensity\" and the \"duration\" of a pleasure.\nThe quantity of a pleasure refers to the strength of the experience. More intense pleasures are valued more highly than less intense pleasures.\nThe quality of a pleasure refers to the type of experience. Some types of experiences are valued more highly than others. For example, being in love is valued more highly than simply feeling happy.\nBoth the quantity and quality of a pleasure matter for its value. A pleasure that is both intense and of a type that is highly valued will be more highly valued than a less intense pleasure."}

{"question": " Nathanson supports which of the following kinds of retributivism?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "preventive"}, {"label": "B", "text": "proportional"}, {"label": "C", "text": "equality"}, {"label": "D", "text": "retaliatory"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Retributivism is a theory of justice that holds that the main purpose of punishment is to retributively harm the guilty party.\nThere are several types of retributivism. Here are some ways in which retributivists might differ from each other:\nSome retributivists might believe that the severity of the punishment should match the severity of the crime. These retributivists might propose a proportional theory of retribution.\nSome retributivists might believe that the punishment should be equal to the crime. These retributivists might propose an equality theory of retribution.\nSome retributivists might believe that the punishment should be worse than the crime. These retributivists might propose a preventive theory of retribution.\nSome retributivists might believe that the purpose of punishment is to prevent future crimes. These retributivists might propose a preventive theory of retribution.\nSOLUTION: To determine which type of retributivism Nathanson supports, look at the answer choice.\nNathanson supports a retaliatory theory of retribution. According to a retaliatory theory, the purpose of punishment is to repay the offender in kind for the harm they caused.\nNathanson does not support a preventive theory of retribution.\nNathanson does not support an equality theory of retribution.\nNathanson does not support a proportional theory of retribution."}
{"question": " Carruthers approaches questions about the moral standing of nonhuman animals from the perspective of which of the following moral theories?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "consequentialism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kantianism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "virtue ethics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "contractualism"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Consequentialism is a moral theory that determines the rightness or wrongness of an action based on its consequences. So, Carruthers is approaching questions about the moral standing of nonhuman animals from a consequentialist perspective."}
{"question": " In Gardiner's analysis, which of the following is a characteristic of the climate change problem?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "institutional adequacy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "dispersion of causes and effects"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fragmentation of agency"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: One of the key questions in any policy analysis is identifying the problem that policy is intended to solve. Problems may have various characteristics, or features. One way of classifying problems is by their characteristics.\nSome problems are complex, some are urgent, and others are both. Some problems are dispersion problems, in which multiple causes lead to a single effect. Some problems are agency problems, in which multiple decision-makers have some control over a outcome. Some problems are institutional problems, in which the roles and behaviors of institutions are part of the problem.\nSOLUTION: One characteristic of the climate change problem is dispersion of causes and effects. Climate change is a global problem with global effects. Many different countries and groups are involved in causing climate change, and many different countries and groups will be affected by it.\nAnother characteristic of the climate change problem is institutional adequacy. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which has been signed by 196 countries, is an attempt to solve the problem of climate change through institutional means.\nA third characteristic of the climate change problem is fragmentation of agency. Different countries and groups have some control over the causes of climate change. So, multiple decision-makers have some control over the outcome.\nA fourth characteristic of the climate change problem is that it is a global problem that affects many different countries and groups."}
{"question": " What is the \"intergenerational storm\" of climate change?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the problem of massive world overpopulation over generations."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the problem that the bad effects of current carbon dioxide emissions will fall largely on future generations."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the problem that the compounding effects of greenhouse gas emissions require the current generation to, in effect, cooperate with future generations."}, {"label": "D", "text": "the problem that countries are possibly biased toward the interests of the current generation, which largely benefits from carbon dioxide emissions."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Climate change is a problem that will be felt more strongly in future generations than in the current generation. The problem is often called the \"intergenerational storm\" because the costs of adapting to and mitigating climate change will be borne by future generations, who have not yet been born."}

This indicates that Dershowitz believes that important decisions can be made quickly and without authorization from the highest-level officials."}
{"question": " Baxter argues that we should view our treatment of the environment as a matter of various trade-offs whose aim is", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "to minimize damage incurred by all individual living beings."}, {"label": "B", "text": "to minimize the suffering of all sentient creatures."}, {"label": "C", "text": "to promote the functional integrity of ecosystems."}, {"label": "D", "text": "to promote human welfare."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The question is about how to balance the benefits and costs of different approaches to environmental protection. This involves making trade-offs between the various values that Baxter discusses.\nThe table in the question shows some specific examples of trade-offs. For example, using organic farming techniques might reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers, which could lower the risk of pollution to rivers and streams, but it might also reduce agricultural productivity, which could increase the cost of food.\nAn important point is that the benefits and costs of different approaches to environmental protection are not always clear. For example, using organic farming techniques might reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers, but it might also reduce agricultural productivity. So, the trade-off between the benefits and costs of using organic farming techniques is not always clear.\nIn general, the aim of trade-offs is to determine how to achieve the best outcome, or the best result, for everyone who is affected. So, the answer is D."}
{"question": " Which of the following is an example of a value-based moral theory?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "consequentialism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "virtue ethics"}, {"label": "C", "text": "both A and B"}, {"label": "D", "text": "neither A nor B"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: A value-based moral theory is one that focuses on the values or principles that should guide our moral decisions. These theories explore how we should live our lives and what we should believe in.\nConsequentialism is a value-based moral theory. Consequentialism focuses on the consequences of actions. It holds that the best action is the one that has the best consequences.\nVirtue ethics is a value-based moral theory. Virtue ethics focuses on the virtues or character traits that a person should have. It holds that we should behave in ways that display virtues such as honesty, courage, and compassion.\nBoth A and B are correct. Consequentialism and virtue ethics are both value-based moral theories.\nNeither A nor B is correct. Deontological ethics is a type of moral theory. It is not a value-based moral theory. Deontological ethics focuses on the duties and rights that arise within relationships. It holds that some actions are wrong in and of themselves, regardless of their consequences."}

{"question": " Why, according to Gill, does Leon Kass think the notion of being \"better off dead\" is incoherent?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "because dead people no longer exist, and thus cannot benefit from choosing to die."}, {"label": "B", "text": "because some things (e.g., long-term torture) are worse than death."}, {"label": "C", "text": "because there has yet to be a satisfactory philosophical explanation of why death is bad."}, {"label": "D", "text": "because death is, by definition, undesirable."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: According to the passage, Leon Kass thinks the notion of being \"better off dead\" is incoherent because some things (e.g., long-term torture) are worse than death. The passage does not discuss the concepts of existence and non-existence, philosophical explanations of why death is bad, or the definition of death."}
{"question": " In response to the argument that embryos are not persons because they lack certain rights that all persons have (such as the right to life), Lee and George argue that", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the right to life belongs to a human being at all times that he or she exists."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the right to life belongs to all living creatures, human or not."}, {"label": "C", "text": "not all persons have the right to life-for example, a murderer has given up his or her right to life through his or her actions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Lee and George argue that the right to life belongs to a human being at all times that he or she exists. The right to life is attributed to a human being, not a rock or a plant."}
{"question": " The consequentialist approach to punishment is at odds with", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "retributive theories of punishment."}, {"label": "B", "text": "perfectionist theories of punishment."}, {"label": "C", "text": "legal theories of punishment."}, {"label": "D", "text": "preventive theories of punishment."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Retributive theories of punishment are based on the idea that punishment is justified by the harm caused by the crime. Retributive theories see punishment as a response to the offender's moral blameworthiness for the harm caused. So, retributive theories of punishment are at odds with the consequentialist approach, which focuses on the outcome of punishment.\nPerfectionist theories of punishment are also at odds with the consequentialist approach. Perfectionist theories see the primary purpose of punishment as the rehabilitation of the offender, not the prevention of future crime or the retribution for past harm.\nLegal theories of punishment are also at odds with the consequentialist approach. Legal theories see the primary purpose of punishment as the enforcement of the law and the maintenance of social order.\nPreventive theories of punishment are at odds with the consequentialist approach. Preventive theories see the primary purpose of punishment as the prevention of future crime, not the retribution for past harm or the rehabilitation of the offender."}
{"question": " What does Hursthouse say about the claim that any adequate action-guiding (i.e., moral) theory must provide clear guidance about what ought and ought not to be done that any intelligent person could follow?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "She says the claim is very plausible."}, {"label": "B", "text": "She says the claim is implausible."}, {"label": "C", "text": "She says the claim is self-evident."}, {"label": "D", "text": "She says the claim is true."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Hursthouse says that the claim is implausible."}

{"question": " In response to the objection that freedom of association is much more important in the marital context than the political realm, Wellman says", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "there is no freedom of association in the marital context."}, {"label": "B", "text": "his argument does not require that marital and political freedom of association be equally important."}, {"label": "C", "text": "freedom of association is equally important in both contexts."}, {"label": "D", "text": "none of the above"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Wellman does not argue that freedom of association is not important in the marital context. Instead, he argues that the importance of freedom of association in the marital context does not necessarily mean that there should be an absolute right to marry whomever one wants."}
{"question": " If it were known that a policy would wipe out several animal species without negatively affecting human beings, Baxter would most likely say that", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "this policy is morally problematic because it harms the environment."}, {"label": "B", "text": "this policy is morally problematic because it damages the integrity of the ecosystem."}, {"label": "C", "text": "this policy is morally obligatory because the environment ought not to exist."}, {"label": "D", "text": "this policy is morally unproblematic."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Baxter would argue that the policy is morally problematic because it damages the integrity of the ecosystem. Baxter sees the environment and the ecosystem as intertwined, and damaging the ecosystem can harm the environment. So, a policy that wipes out several animal species without harming human beings would be morally problematic for Baxter, because it damages the integrity of the ecosystem."}
{"question": " According to Reiman, van den Haag's argument leads to the conclusion that", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "we should refrain from imposing the death penalty."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the refusal to execute criminals has a civilizing effect."}, {"label": "C", "text": "we should institute death by torture."}, {"label": "D", "text": "murder is wrong."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: According to Reiman, van den Haag argues that the death penalty is a just and necessary punishment for the worst offenders. Reiman disagrees with this argument, claiming that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder and that it is morally unjustifiable.\nReiman believes that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder. This is a different argument than the one Reiman is making. Whether or not the death penalty is a deterrent to murder is a separate question from whether or not the death penalty is morally justifiable."}

The principle of equality requires that we not discriminate between people unless we have a good reason. So, if we decide to help one person with a welfare program, we must give equal consideration to helping others in the same situation. We cannot discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or nationality."}
{"question": " Advocates of care ethics argue that", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "care ethics is an important development of virtue ethics."}, {"label": "B", "text": "that traditional moral theories have difficulty explaining the rightness or wrongness of attitudes."}, {"label": "C", "text": "that the only important more concepts are care and compassion."}, {"label": "D", "text": "that we should think about welfare and happiness in terms of sympathy."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Advocates of care ethics argue that the only important moral concepts are care and compassion. They reject traditional moral theories because they see them as too focused on duties and rules. Care ethics offers a more feminist approach to ethics that highlights the centrality of caring relationships and the importance of empathy and compassion."}
{"question": " According to Norcross, any attempt to justify the claim that humans have a higher moral status than other animals by appealing to some version of rationality as the morally relevant difference between humans and animals will", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "fail to give an adequate answer to the argument from marginal cases."}, {"label": "B", "text": "fail to make the case that such a difference is morally relevant to the status of animals as moral patients as opposed to their status as moral agents."}, {"label": "C", "text": "both A and B"}, {"label": "D", "text": "neither A nor B"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Look at the argument:\nArgument from marginal cases: Some humans are mentally retarded and some animals are highly intelligent. Does this mean that mentally retarded humans have a lower moral status than highly intelligent animals? Of course not.\nThe key is that humans are a distinct species. As such, all humans have a higher moral status than all animals.\nThe same is true of animals. As a distinct species, all animals have a higher moral status than humans.\nHumans are a distinct species from animals. But being a member of a distinct species is not what gives you a higher moral status. Instead, it is the fact that you are a member of a species that has the capacity for rationality that gives you a higher moral status.\nRationality is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a higher moral status. So, what is the sufficient condition? Why, being a member of the human species, of course!\nBeing a member of the human species is the sufficient condition for having a higher moral status. But being a member of a species is not what gives you a higher moral status. Having the capacity for rationality is what gives you a higher moral status. And, as we have seen, being a member of the human species is what gives you the capacity for rationality."}
{"question": " In response to the argument that the death penalty does not deter murderers, van den Haag claims that", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "he is still confident that the threat of the death penalty at least sometimes prevents murder."}, {"label": "B", "text": "criminal law is supposed to protect the innocent over murderers."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the severity and finality of the death penalty is appropriate to the seriousness and finality of murder."}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: van den Haag argues that the death penalty does deter murder. He says that the threat of the death penalty can prevent some murders. He uses the example of the New York police department. He says that the police department could prevent murders by threatening to execute people who commit murder. So, the threat of the death penalty can prevent some murders."}

Consequentialist considerations focus on the consequences of actions, while dignity-based considerations focus on the moral worth of the individuals involved. Nagel claims that these two types of considerations come into conflict in war.\nForward-looking and backward-looking considerations are not the types of moral considerations Nagel discusses in \"War and Massacre.\"\nUtilitarian considerations focus on the greatest good for the greatest number.

Central Park is a physical territory that is open to the public, and so it does not qualify as a state.\nThere is a principle of territorial rights that supports the idea that there are limits to what anyone, including a state, can demand of people who are in a territory. This principle supports the idea that there are limits to what a yoga group that practices in Central Park can demand of people who come to the park.\nBut the principle of territorial rights only applies to individuals. It does not apply to groups of individuals. So, a yoga group that practices in Central Park is not committed to observing the principle of territorial rights."}

The paragraph also discusses the issue of poverty and social justice.\nChoice \"around one quarter of all human deaths.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"around one third of all human deaths.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"around one half of all human deaths.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"none of the above.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"around one half of all human deaths.\" is the best estimate.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, around 58% of all global deaths in 2004 were poverty-related. This includes deaths from malnutrition and other diseases that are more common in countries with high levels of poverty."}
{"question": " What is the overall percentage of capital cases that are overturned because of serious errors?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "under 50 percent"}, {"label": "B", "text": "52 percent"}, {"label": "C", "text": "68 percent"}, {"label": "D", "text": "82 percent"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The question asks about the overall percentage of capital cases that are overturned because of serious errors. The question does not specify the type of error.\nA 2014 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that among the 8,524 prisoners who were exonerated as of 2014, 83% were convicted of murder or manslaughter. Among the prisoners exonerated for murder or manslaughter, 11% were exonerated because of serious errors. So, about 11% of the prisoners exonerated for murder or manslaughter were exonerated because of serious errors."}
{"question": " According to Nussbaum, treating someone as an object is", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "sufficient for sexual objectification."}, {"label": "B", "text": "necessary for sexual objectification."}, {"label": "C", "text": "not necessary for sexual objectification."}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Look at the passage. It describes the concept of objectification.\nTo objectify someone is to treat them as if they are not a person. According to Nussbaum, sexual objectification is a type of exploitation. To exploit someone is to use them for your own ends, without considering their needs or wants.\nWhen you are in a relationship, you should try to treat your partner as an equal. This means respecting their needs and wants, and considering their feelings.\nIf you are not sure what your partner wants, you can ask. But you should not try to use or manipulate your partner for your own benefit."}

To show this, Rachels compares the cases of Smith and Jones.\nThe fact that someone is about to die from hunger or thirst is not enough to make it morally permissible to let them die.\nJones is about to die from hunger and thirst. Since there is no one to help Jones, he will die. But the fact that he is about to die from hunger and thirst is not enough to make it morally permissible to let him die.\nOn the other hand, killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die.\nIf letting die is not in itself morally worse than killing, then killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die."}

But he also believes that societies have duties toward nonmembers. These duties are limited, but they do exist.\nOne reason for Macedo's position is that societies have a impact on the well-being of nonmembers. For example, the operations of a corporation may harm the environment, affecting the health of people who are not members of the corporation. Or, the policies of a government may harm the economic interests of people who are not citizens of the government's country.\nAnother reason is that societies have a history of unfair treatment of nonmembers. For example, many corporations in the past had policies that unfairly discriminated against nonwhites. And, many governments have oppressed minority groups within their borders.\nMacedo mentions several duties that he believes societies have toward nonmembers. These duties include:\nduties of fair dealing (e.g., nonexploitation)\ncosmopolitan egalitarian duties (e.g., ensuring that everyone has equal wealth)\nduties of rectification and redress (e.g., redressing those who were oppressed)\nhumanitarian duties (e.g., preventing systematic violations of human rights)"}

He wrote many books, but the one that is most relevant to Mill's theory of utility is his Critique of Practical Reason.\nIn this book, Kant argues that each person has duty, or a moral obligation, to act in certain ways. According to Kant, our duties come from the fact that we are rational beings. As such, we are obligated to act in ways that respect the inherent worth of other rational beings.\nKant does not believe that we necessarily desire to act in accordance with our duties. In fact, he thinks that we often act in ways that are contrary to our duties. Instead, he believes that we feel a sense of guilt when we do not act in accordance with our duties. This guilt shows that we have a sense of what is right and wrong, and that we are obligated to act in accordance with our duties."}

This means that offensive political violence is justified in order to regain control of a territory.\nPolitical violence can be defensive, which means that it is used to repel an attack. In this case, the violence is not used to directly expand the territory.\nEconomically motivated political violence is not a just cause for territorial political violence. This type of violence is used to gain control of resources or to overthrow an oppressive government.\nA just cause for political violence is not necessarily about defending a government or its policies. It is about defending a territory."}

The passage discusses how the actions of groups can affect the freedom of association of their members. The passage does not discuss individual freedom of association. So, this statement is incorrect.\nThen, consider the following statements: \"private clubs can rightfully exclude outsiders\" and \"the actions of groups can affect members outside that group.\" These statements are discussing two different things. The first statement is discussing the difference between individual and group freedom of association. The second statement is discussing how group actions can affect non-group members. So, these statements are not contradicting each other.\nNext, consider the following statements: \"private clubs can rightfully exclude outsiders\" and \"all of the above.\" The \"all of the above\" statement is incorrect, as it does not contain all the relevant information. The passage discusses how the actions of groups can affect non-group members. So, the actions of private clubs can affect not only their members but also people in the neighborhood."}

This idea is similar to the concept of a contract.\nA contract is a set of agreements. A contract has three basic parts, or sections: offer, acceptance, and consideration. An offer is a statement of the terms that one party is willing to agree to. Acceptance is assent to the terms of the offer. Consideration is something of value that each party receives as a result of the agreement.\nSo, an actual or hypothetical social agreement of some sort is what defines correct or justified moral rules or principles. This agreement may include promises and assurances from the parties who are bound by the agreement."}

It is a form of dehumanization. Objectification is not the same as sexual desire or attraction.\nSexual objectification is a form of sexual desire that does not see the other person as a subject or a partner, but as an object. This form of sexual desire is dehumanizing because it reduces the other person to the level of a thing."}

According to moral nihilism, there are no moral truths or moral principles that can guide our behavior.\nJust war theory is a view about the moral considerations that apply to war. It is not a view about whether moral considerations apply to war.\nAntiwar pacifism is a view about the morality of war.

The answer is D.\nA universalizable principle is one that people can consistently apply across different situations. This means that if a principle is universalizable, people can follow it without confusion.\nSOLUTION: Imagine an economy with two factories. One is owned by a local entrepreneur, and the other is owned by a multinational corporation. The factories have the same impact on the environment.\nNow, imagine that the citizens of the country are deciding whether to implement a policy that allows factories to emit more pollutants into the environment. A universal principle would say that factories should not emit more pollutants into the environment. This principle can be applied consistently across different situations.\nThe fact that a principle is universalizable does not mean that it is the only thing that matters to people. As the example above shows, people may care about other things, too. But a universalizable principle is an important part of a minimally just legal and economic system."}

Reiman disagrees, arguing that the right to retaliate does not justify the death penalty.\nThe right to retaliate does not require that retaliation be proportionate. So, the fact that the death penalty is a form of retaliation does not mean that it is moral.\nRetaliation is a matter of justice, not revenge. In order to determine whether the death penalty is a morally permissible form of retaliation, we need to determine whether it is proportionate to the crime.\nThe death penalty is not proportionate to the crime of murder.

But an environmental ethic does not necessarily equate the moral standing of beings with the beings' ability to feel pleasure and pain.\nSome nonhuman beings, such as mammals and birds, are capable of feeling pleasure and pain. Other nonhuman beings, such as trees, are not. But all nonhuman beings are alive. And many people believe that being alive is sufficient for a being to have direct moral standing."}

Instead, we should adopt a social contract approach to the problem of global economic justice.\nThe social contract is an economic model that suggests that people accept the institutions and laws of a society in return for the protection of those institutions and laws. In the context of global economic justice, the social contract approach suggests that people in wealthier countries accept the obligation to provide assistance to people in extreme poverty in return for the benefits that they have received from a global economic system that has left many people in extreme poverty."}

Some of the liberty-limiting principles that are relevant to Mill's harm principle include the harm principle, the offense principle, and the principle of legal paternalism.\nThe harm principle holds that the only justification for limiting an individual's freedom is to prevent harm to others. This means that each individual has the right to do as he pleases, as long as his activities do not harm others.\nThe offense principle holds that the only justification for limiting an individual's freedom is to prevent offense to others. This means that each individual has the right to do as he pleases, as long as his activities do not offend others.\nThe principle of legal paternalism holds that the state may restrict individual freedom in order to protect individuals from harm caused by their own poor decisions.\nThe principle of legal moralism holds that the state may restrict individual freedom in order to enforce moral values.\nSOLUTION: Mill defends the harm principle. The harm principle holds that the only justification for limiting an individual's freedom is to prevent harm to others. This means that each individual has the right to do as he pleases, as long as his activities do not harm others."}

Nathanson argues that this failure leads to the requirement that we punish criminals in ways that are morally unacceptable.\nHe also argues that Kant's principle of equality and an \"eye for an eye\" do not provide an adequate measure of moral desert. How can a punishment that does not take into account the difference between intention and outcome provide a just punishment? The answer is that it cannot.\nNathanson also argues that Kant's principle of equality and an \"eye for an eye\" fail to tell us what the appropriate punishment would be for all cases of criminal action.

In other words, the entity has moral standing if recognizing its moral standing would make a significant difference in the practical outcomes.\nAccording to Carruthers, nonhuman animals may be accorded indirect moral standing. Indirect moral standing means that nonhuman animals are not themselves the objects of moral duties, but their moral standing has practical benefits.

It goes forward, and then backward, and then forward again. The clock can only move one way, but it can move very, very slowly. This idea of history as a clock explains why it is so hard to change a culture. A culture is what happens when one generation builds on the work of the previous generation. This means that a culture is a clock that ticks forward. But just because a clock ticks, it doesn't mean anything. A clock is a mechanism, not a philosophy.\nClocks can be slowed by changing how the mechanism works. This is called the principle of leCTURE: A culture, or way of life, is built on the accumulation of many small changes. Some of these changes are good, and others are bad. But whether a change is good or bad depends on what it does to the clock.\nA change that slows the clock is a change that makes the future different from the past. This is a change that makes history go backward.\nA change that speeds the clock is a change that makes the future the same as the past. This is a change that makes history go forward.\nThe principle of conservation of momentum says that when a clock is slowed down, it will eventually come to a stop. So, to get a clock started again, you have to speed it up.\nThis is the principle behind the idea that progress is possible. Progress happens when changes that speed up the clock become more common than changes that slow it down.\nThis is why it is possible to change a culture. Change a culture by making changes that speed up the clock.\nLeopold claims that history has shown that \"the conqueror role is eventually self-defeating.\" It is self-defeating, in this view, because the conqueror can never understand what makes the conquered community tick.\nThe clock is different in every community. So, to change a culture, you have to know what makes that clock tick."}

Wellman argues that a state's duty to its current citizens includes the duty to exclude people from its territory. Fine's critique of this argument focuses on the idea that a state's presumptive right to exclude people from its territory is incompatible with the right to freedom of association."}

For example, if a user expects to experience a certain effect from a drug, they are more likely to experience that effect. If a user expects a drug to be harmful, they may experience negative effects.\nExpectations can also shape a user's experience with drugs in other ways.

In the case of the proposal to establish world food banks, Hardin would argue that if the food banks were to be stocked only with donations from richer countries, the donations would be subject to the tragedy of the commons. The richer countries might make donations today, but they might not make enough donations to replenish the food banks in the future. As a result, the food banks would eventually run out of food."}

It has value to Mary because it is useful to her. But the value of the laptop is not independent of Mary's caring about it. So, the laptop has moral standing because Mary cares about it."}

This means that we must always treat other people with respect and never use them for our own gain.\nEngaging in prostitution involves using other people for one's own sexual gratification. So, engaging in prostitution is impermissible, according to Kant's humanity formulation.\nSelling one of our teeth is not impermissible, according to Kant's humanity formulation."}

This is his conclusion.\nKass assumes that reproductive cloning is inherently morally wrong. This is a premise of his argument.\nKass assumes that cloning is not inherently morally wrong. This is not a premise of his argument.\nKass assumes that the permissibility of cloning depends on the parent's intent to raise the child. This is not a premise of his argument.\nKass assumes that we have a good reason not to clone. This is not a premise of his argument."}

It tells you what Smith's action is supposed to be an example of.\nSmith's action is supposed to be an example of letting die. So, killing is not the answer.\nAssistant: LECTURE: What is a thought experiment?\nA thought experiment is a type of experiment that is conducted in your mind rather than in a laboratory. Thought experiments are used to explore the implications of a theory or to question the assumptions of a problem.\nSome of the best known thought experiments include the story of The Torture Chamber and the thought experiment known as Schr\u00f6dinger's cat.\nHow can you identify the part of a thought experiment that is supposed to be an example of?\nThe part of the thought experiment that is supposed to be an example of some concept usually tells you that. For example, in the thought experiment described above, the part of the thought experiment that is supposed to be an example of letting die is the fact that the lifeguard does not enter the pool to save the child.\nThe other parts of the thought experiment are not examples of letting die. The fact that the child is not a strong swimmer is not an example of letting die. The fact that the child is under the water for an extended period is not an example of letting die."}

{"question": " According to Ross, when our duties conflict with each other we should", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "not do anything because duties cannot actually conflict with each other."}, {"label": "B", "text": "use moral judgment to determine which duty should be obeyed."}, {"label": "C", "text": "consult authorities instead of relying on our own judgment."}, {"label": "D", "text": "wait until the conflict ceases on its own."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Duties can conflict with each other, which means that you cannot do everything you ought to do at the same time. If you choose to do one thing, you cannot do another. So, you need to use moral judgment to decide which duty should be obeyed.\nConsulting authorities can be helpful, but they will not tell you which duty to prioritize. Authorities provide guidance, but they do not make decisions for you.\nYou should not wait until the conflict ceases on its own. Some conflicts resolve on their own, but others do not. For example, a conflict between duties might continue indefinitely, or it might get worse."}

It tells you what Kamm claims. Kamm claims that Sandel's moral distinction between treatment and enhancement assumes that nature in itself has no moral value.\nNature in itself has no moral value means that plants, rocks, and animals have no rights.\nHonoring nature does not mean giving it a right to equal consideration. Honoring nature means not destroying it for their own sake. But nature has no rights.\nWanting enhancement more than treatment may be true, but it is not relevant to Kamm's argument. Kamm is talking about the moral difference between treatment and enhancement.\nThere is no moral difference between treatment and enhancement may be true for Kamm, but this view is not the focus of her argument."}

It asks you to explain how the argument is constructed and why the argument is flawed. The argument is flawed because it assumes that all feminists would agree with the premise that the harm of rape has nothing to do with the victim's gender. The correct approach is to figure out what the argument is, and then determine why the argument is flawed.\nThe argument is that feminist legal theory has led to the under-acknowledgement of the harms of consensual sex. The argument is flawed for two reasons: first, because it overlooks the possibility that the harm of rape could include the fact that the victim is a woman; second, because it assumes that all feminists would agree with the premise that the harm of rape has nothing to do with the victim's gender."}

Kamm believes that some desires for mastery can be redeemed, and that the desire to cure congenital blindness is a case in point. Kamm argues that even though the scientist is motivated by a bad desire for mastery, her action of working on a cure for congenital blindness is permissible. This suggests that sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire."}

So, determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person is not sufficient to settle the abortion issue.\nThere are other questions that need to be considered. For example, does the fetus have the same rights as a born person? If so, when do those rights begin? Or, is the mother's right to choose abortion outweighed by the fetus's right to life?"}
{"question": " In satisfying Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative, we are obligated to adopt two very general goals: the goal of promoting the (morally permissible) ends of others and the goal of", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "self-perfection."}, {"label": "B", "text": "producing happiness."}, {"label": "C", "text": "increasing welfare."}, {"label": "D", "text": "self-sacrifice."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: According to Kant, the only way to achieve the two general goals is to treat humanity as an end in itself, not as a means to some other end. To do this, we must follow the moral law, which requires that we act in ways that could be universal laws.\nIn other words, to satisfy the Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative, we must act in ways that promote the ends of others. This means that we must not treat people as mere means to our own ends. Instead, we must recognize that each person is an end in himself or herself.\nIncreasing welfare is one way to promote the ends of others. Producing happiness and self-perfection are not. Self-sacrifice is not either."}

It also states that ongoing patterns of behavior by a large number of agents which predictably result in many others coming to be deprived of the object of a fundamental human right: the means of subsistence are examples of structural human rights violations. The violation of fundamental human rights brought about the political structures of a particular government is also mentioned as an example of a structural human rights violation."}
{"question": " Which of the following is a possible source of obligations, according to Cohen?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "rights"}, {"label": "B", "text": "freely made commitments"}, {"label": "C", "text": "special relations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Cohen's conception of obligation is a social relationship that involves both rights and freely made commitments. Obligations can arise from special relations, such as promises or contracts, or from the rights of individuals.\nObligations can also arise from Cohen's third source of obligations, special relations. These are relations in which one is obligated to another because of a special circumstance or agreement. For example, promises and contracts are special relations that can give rise to obligations.\nObligations can also arise from Cohen's first source of obligations, the rights of individuals. These rights can include both legal rights and moral rights. Legal rights are rights that are recognized by a court of law. Moral rights are rights that are not legally enforceable but that people often consider to be rightfully theirs.\nCohen's conception of obligation is similar to the idea that obligations are based on rights. Obligations are rights-based in that they arise from rights and obligations that individuals have. But Cohen's conception of obligation is not identical to the idea that obligations are based on rights. For example, Cohen's conception of obligation includes the idea that obligations can arise from freely made commitments.\nSOLUTION: Cohen argues that obligations can arise from rights, from freely made commitments, and from special relations. So, all of the above are possible sources of obligations according to Cohen."}

Violence includes not only physical assaults but also the far more common, everyday violence of sexist speech.\nSexist speech can cause lasting emotional distress, and it may also contribute to a culture in which violence against women is more accepted."}

The question then asks which factor Shapiro cites as explaining this decrease.\nThe study described by Shapiro cited the difference in social setting as the factor that explained the decrease in heroin use. The study found that the decrease in heroin use among Vietnam veterans was linked to the veterans' return to a social setting with fewer drug users.\nThe type of drug used, the duration over which the users used the drug, and the pharmacological effects of heroin are factors that could affect heroin use. However, these factors are not what Shapiro cited as explaining the decrease in heroin use."}

They suggest several strategies to address this challenge.\nOne suggestion they make is to promote greater understanding of historical and contemporary oppression. This could help students understand the challenges faced by marginalized groups and facilitate more open and honest dialogue.\nAnother suggestion is to defund the Department of Education. This is a radical approach that is unlikely to be effective.\nHaving colleges and universities officially and strongly discourage trigger warnings may help reduce the use of trigger warnings, which Lukianoff and Haidt argue can contribute to vindictive protectiveness.\nPromoting greater understanding of historical and contemporary oppression and having colleges and universities officially and strongly discourage trigger warnings are two of the strategies Lukianoff and Haidt propose to address vindictive protectiveness."}

Fine would respond by saying that this is untrue. The liberal state cannot claim to be primarily an intimate or expressive association, but it is also not a vehicle for the accumulation of expressive power. A state is different from other forms of association, such as a club, in that it is not based on voluntary association. Rather, a state claims authority over a specific territory and population.\nYou do not have the right to refuse a legitimate marriage proposal. The right to marry is not a right to enter into a marital relationship with a specific person. Rather, the right to marry is a right to enter into a marital relationship with anyone.\nThere is no difference between marital relationships and the relationship between a citizen and his state. According to Fine, a state is not a vehicle for the accumulation of expressive power. Rather, a state claims authority over a specific territory and population.\nRefusing to marry someone cannot be a cause of harm. According to Fine, the harm caused by exclusionary borders is a result of the state's claim to authority, not a result of any voluntary action."}

Ross's list of prima facie duties includes duties not to harm others, to help others, and to be honest. Audi argues that there are other duties that should also be included on this list.\nOne of the duties that Audi proposes be included on the list is enhancement and preservation of freedom. This duty is based on the idea that it is a moral duty to help others increase their freedom.\nAnother duty that Audi proposes be included on the list is respectfulness. This duty is based on the idea that it is a moral duty to treat others with respect and not to be disrespectful to them.\nVeracity is not on Audi's list of proposed duties. However, it is on Ross's list.\nAll of the above duties are on Audi's list of proposed duties."}
{"question": " According to Singer, which of the following historical defenders of the principle of equal consideration of interests was one of the few to recognize that the principle applies to members of other species as well as to our own?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Immanuel Kant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Aristotle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jeremy Bentham"}, {"label": "D", "text": "John Stuart Mill"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill are the only options that come from the utilitarian tradition. According to Bentham, \"the interests of every sort, of every individual, are to be regarded.\" And Mill, in Chapter 2 of Utilitarianism, states that the principle of utility tells you to \"consider the interests of the whole human race as your own.\" So, these utilitarians did extend the principle of equal consideration of interests to members of other species.\nAristotle did not develop a theory of ethics that had the scope to apply to members of other species. His theory of ethics is concerned with the happiness of individuals, but he does not argue that we should consider the interests of other species.\nImmanuel Kant is not one of the few philosophers who has recognized that the principle of equal consideration of interests applies to members of other species. In Kant's view, humans have a duty to treat members of other species as ends in themselves, but this is a duty to treat them kindly, not to consider their interests."}

The argument from marginal cases involves considering beings that are most similar to animals in terms of their cognitive abilities and behavior. It claims that if these beings have full moral standing, then animals do as well. This argument is a formidable challenge to any proposed criterion of full moral standing that excludes animals.\nThe ontological argument and the argument from cosmology do not question the moral standing of animals. The ontological argument claims that it is impossible to imagine a being with greater moral standing than God. The argument from cosmology claims that the existence of the universe depends on the moral standing of animals. These arguments do not question the moral standing of animals; rather, they assume that animals have full moral standing."}

Deontological ethics is a type of consequentialism, but it differs from other types of consequentialism in that it focuses on the rightness or wrongness of actions, not the consequences of those actions.\nAccording to Kant, the rightness of an action does not depend on the outcome but on whether the action is done for the right reason. A action is right if the reason for the action is to follow the moral law. The moral law is the principle that governs all morally worthy action. It tells you what is right and wrong, regardless of the consequences."}

The argument is proposed by medical doctors. So, the argument undermines itself. This happens when an organization or a group is arguing against a proposal by its own members. The members of the organization or group may have special knowledge or insight into the proposal, and so, their arguments against the proposal are more powerful than those of others. In this case, the medical doctors who are proposing the argument may be able to make a more compelling case against the Oregon physician-assisted law than other people could."}

It discusses the values that are important to consider when deciding whether to use a hypothetical device that can eliminate certain types of memories. The device would eliminate memories that people have of having had certain kinds of experiences. The experiences in question are associated with feeling vulnerable to certain kinds of harm.\nAccording to the passage, one value that is important to consider is egalitarian values concerning the elimination of inequalities that make people vulnerable to oppression. The passage suggests that one reason to use the device would be to eliminate memories of experiences that make people vulnerable to oppression.\nAnother value that is important to consider is libertarian values concerning individuals' property rights and freedom of movement. The passage does not suggest that using the device would affect people's property rights or their freedom of movement."}

Each type of harm can be a reason for censorship.\nExpressive harm: Censorship can prevent an artist from expressing certain ideas. This type of harm involves the expression of ideas.\nCausal harm: This type of harm involves the causation of physical, emotional, or economic harm. Censorship can prevent the dissemination of information that could prevent harm.\nPhysical harm: This type of harm involves the body. Censorship can prevent the publication of information that could lead to physical harm.\nIntentional harm: This type of harm involves intent. Censorship can prevent the distribution of information that was created with the intent to harm others."}

The Dust Bowl was a series of severe dust storms that hit the United States in the 1930s. The dust storms were caused in part by poor farming practices. After the dust storms, farming practices changed, and the soil was preserved. So, the Dust Bowl led to a permanent change in farming practices.\nHardin argues that world hunger and poverty can have a similar impact. If world hunger and poverty led to the recognition of the right to be free from hunger, this would be a ratchet change. A ratchet change makes it possible to move in the opposite direction, but it makes it harder to return to the old ways."}

By doing business with them, corporations are knowingly profiting from stolen wealth. Murderers of those who witness crimes and prostitutes who knowingly spread disease are engaged in illegal activities that may result in harm to others. People who knowingly buy stolen goods are engaged in a legal activity that may also result in harm to others, but their actions are not as heinous as murder or spreading disease."}

This duty is a consequence of the fact that our consumption patterns have directly caused harm to the global poor. So, Pogge believes that those of us who live in wealthy countries have very stringent duties towards the global poor.\nThis duty can be broken down into three parts:\nLibertarian duties towards the global poor: This type of duty would tell you that you ought to abstain from interfering with the global poor. Pogge does not argue for this type of duty.\nNegative duties towards the global poor: This type of duty would tell you that you ought to stop harming the global poor. Pogge does argue for this type of duty.\nPositive duties towards the global poor: This type of duty would tell you that you ought to help the global poor. Pogge does argue for this type of duty.\nEgalitarian duties towards the global poor: This type of duty would tell you that you ought to help the global poor because they are equal members of the human family. Pogge does argue for this type of duty."}

So, if people do actually desire something, that is evidence that it is desirable. Rational insight reveals a desire to be desirable, but it does not reveal other things to be desirable. Expert opinion can provide evidence that something is desirable, but it is not the only evidence. God's opinion is not evidence of what is desirable."}

This understanding of dignity is different from the individualistic conception of dignity as independence and self-determination. Velleman worries that the use of dignity to describe a person's worthiness of care or protection can be used to justify ignoring that person's own wishes or interests.\nFor example, Velleman says that the Nazis used the word dignity to justify their policies of euthanasia and genocide. He also says that the Nazis' use of the word dignity shows that dignity can be used to justify disregarding individual wishes or interests."}

A virtue of character is a good trait that shows how you behave.\nTallness and simplicity are not virtues of character. Tallness is about your physical appearance. Simplicity is about the way things look or are made.\nHonesty and physical beauty are not virtues of character either.\nHonesty is about telling the truth.

He believed that economic motives are morally relevant but not the only consideration. A conservation system based solely on economic motives assumes that the economic parts of the biotic system will function without the uneconomic parts. This is incorrect.\nFor example, consider a forest with both economic and uneconomic species. The economic species can be commercially harvested, and the uneconomic species can contribute to the overall health and diversity of the forest. If a conservation system based solely on economic motives is used, the logging company may clear-cut the forest, destroying both the economic and uneconomic species. This is an incorrect outcome according to Leopold's view."}

From a secular perspective, producing such changes is seen as morally problematic.\nProducing changes in the distribution of traits can be seen to threaten solidarity. Members of a population may feel that they are being divided into winners and losers. They may feel that they are being left behind. So, producing changes in the distribution of traits can be seen to threaten solidarity.\nProducing changes in the distribution of traits can be seen to threaten humility. If members of a population come to see themselves as genetically superior to other people, they may become more arrogant and less humble. So, producing changes in the distribution of traits can be seen to threaten humility.\nProducing changes in the distribution of traits can be seen to threaten responsibility. If members of a population come to see themselves as genetically superior to other people, they may become less responsible for their own choices and actions. So, producing changes in the distribution of traits can be seen to threaten responsibility.\nProducing changes in the distribution of traits does threaten all of the above."}

The argument is that the suffering of animals counts less than the suffering of humans (if it counts at all). This argument is being defended.\nThe defense of this argument may rely on the idea that animals are rational and humans are not. This could be the case if it is believed that only rational beings are able to suffer. If animals are not rational, then their suffering would not be as important as human suffering.\nThe defense of the argument may also rely on the idea that humans are rational and animals are not. This could be the case if it is believed that only rational beings are able to suffer. If humans are rational and animals are not, then human suffering would be more important than animal suffering.\nThe defense of the argument may rely on the idea that animals lack the capacity for suffering, and humans do not. This could be the case if it is believed that animals do not have the ability to experience pain or other forms of suffering. If animals lack this capacity, then their suffering would not be as important as human suffering.\nThe defense of the argument may also rely on the idea that animals can tolerate more suffering than humans can. This could be the case if it is believed that animals have a higher tolerance for pain or other forms of suffering.

Susan Wolf argues that what grounds the value of human beings is their capacity for rational deliberation, and that what is central to human dignity is the fact that human beings have the capacity to form and act on moral judgments.\nA capacity for communal or friendly relationships, a capacity for moral thought, and a capacity for certain kinds of feelings or sentiments could all be considered central to human dignity. However, each of these capacities could be grounded in the capacity for rational deliberation. For example, the capacity for moral thought is based in the capacity to form and act on moral judgments. The capacity for rational deliberation is the foundation for the other capacities."}

Immanuel Kant believed that the rightness of an action could be determined by considering the motivations of the person performing the action. He argued that the only thing that can be said to be right in itself is a action done from duty.\nA virtue is an excellent character trait. Virtue ethics is an approach to ethics that focuses on the development of excellent character traits. This approach emphasizes that a virtuous person has the traits that it is good to have.\nConsequentialism is an approach to ethics that focuses on the consequences of an action. This approach believes that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on the consequences of that action.\nThomson's appeal to the vices of callousness and self-centeredness is an example of a consequentialist approach to abortion. Thomson argues that if a person is self-centered and callous, they are unlikely to want an abortion. So, the fact that some people are self-centered and callous does not show that abortion is wrong.\nSOLUTION: Thomson's appeal to the vices of callousness and self-centeredness relates to what kind of approach to abortion?\nThomson is considering the consequences of the fact that some people are self-centered and callous.

Huemer believes that the harm caused by drug use to individuals is outweighed by the harm caused by the state's prohibition of drug use. Therefore, the harm of drug use to individual drug users does not justify state prohibition of drug use.\nA massive campaign of public health awareness is not the same as state prohibition of drug use. Therefore, the fact that the harm of drug use to individual drug users does not justify state prohibition of drug use does not justify a massive campaign of public health awareness."}

It mentions that Wellman responds to the objection that he is essentially denying that we have a right to freedom of movement. Then, it quotes Wellman as saying that the immigration question is not identical to the freedom-of-movement question. This shows that Wellman would present an argument. He would not beg the question by assuming what he needs to show. He would not use deontological premises to deductively conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable. He would not use an example that is not part of his response to the objection."}

It discusses the comparison of drug use to other legally permitted harmful activities.\nHuemer argues that there is no reason to think that the harms of drug use are in an important sense different from the harms of other legally permitted harmful activities. He contends that, like the harm caused by many other activities that are legal, the harms of drug use are offset by the benefits that accompany the activity.\nThe passage suggests that drug use is not considered more harmful on average than legally permitted harmful activities. This eliminates the answer choice \"more harmful on average than legally permitted harmful activities.\"\nThe passage also suggests that drug use is considered detrimental to a person's character. This is a different question than whether drug use is considered more harmful on average than other legally permitted harmful activities. This eliminates the answer choice \"more detrimental to a person's character than otherslegally permitted harmful activities.\"\nThe passage discusses the comparison of drug use to other legally permitted harmful activities. This eliminates the answer choice \"differing from the harms of other legally permitted harmful activities.\"\nThe passage does not discuss whether drug use is considered more expensive than other legally permitted harmful activities. This eliminates the answer choice \"differing from the harms of other legally permitted harmful activities.\"\nThe assistant has not yet been trained to understand the following content: LECTURE: Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify what a certain experiment can answer? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?"}

Respect for other persons is another value that is often cited as more fundamental than rights and desert.\nArthur believes that justice is more fundamental than rights and desert. Justice is a value that can help to make sure that people get what they deserve. Justice can help to address issues of fairness and inequality.\nFairness is a value that is often related to justice. Fairness can also be related to the idea of people getting what they deserve.\nRespect for other persons is a value that can help to ensure that people are treated with dignity and that they have a sense of self-worth. Respect for other persons is often cited as a more fundamental value than rights and desert because it can help to create a social environment in which people are treated with dignity and are able to reach their full potential.\nIt is important to note that rights and desert are not values. Rights are claims that people have on others. Desert is the idea that people have a moral claim on certain things."}

This means that we should treat people with respect and dignity, and not use them as a way to achieve our own goals.\nWhen we treat someone as a means to an end, we use them to achieve our own goals. In contrast, when we treat someone as an end in themselves, we respect their autonomy and their own goals.\nSo, for a action to comply with the Humanity formulation of the principle, the action must be one that could be universalized. In other words, if everyone did this action, the world would be a better place.\nUsing another person as a means to an end is not an action that could be universalized. If everyone used people as means to their own ends, the world would be a terrible place.\nProducing the most good for everyone concerned is an action that could be universalized. If everyone produced the most good for everyone concerned, the world would be a better place.\nServing one's own best interests is not an action that could be universalized.

This means that he believes that moral principles can recognize limits to what can be achieved, and that following the moral principle may not always lead to action.\nThis is different from the idea that ought implies can. This idea says that if you ought to do something, then you can do it. If following your moral principles would require you to do something that you cannot do, then, according to this idea, you ought not to follow your moral principles in that situation."}

This means that each person is entitled to the same level of liberty as everyone else in society.\nLiberty is the opportunity and resources that belong to that person but nobody else. This means that the most extensive basic liberty includes the freedoms and resources that are not held in common with others.\nHappiness is not the basis for determining the equal right to liberty. The principle of greatest equal liberty is not focused on maximizing happiness, but rather on ensuring that each person has an equal right to liberty.\nSocial and economic inequalities are not the basis for determining the equal right to liberty.

This can lead to conflicts and a high level of litigation. Wellman believes that conflicts over property can be reduced by adopting a more limited set of property rights.\nEgalitarianism is a political philosophy that holds that all individuals should have an equal share of social resources. Egalitarianism is concerned with the distribution of resources, not with the ownership of property rights.\nConsequentialism is a moral theory that holds that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on its consequences.\nAnarchy is a political philosophy that holds that there should be no government. Anarchy is concerned with the organization of society, not with the distribution of resources or the ownership of property rights.\nDeontological theory is a moral theory that holds that an action is right if it follows from the rules of a given set of obligations or duties."}

The case may answer this question with a yes or a no.\nA case may consider an issue based on particular facts. The issue may be answered differently based on the facts. For example, a case may consider whether a contract is enforceable based on whether the parties agreed to the terms of the contract.\nA case may also consider an issue based on legal reasoning. The reasoning may apply a legal principle to the facts of the case.\nSOLUTION: Whether a case censoring an opinion that is partly true and partly false considers whether censoring a partly true and partly false opinion is constitutional depends on the reasoning of the case.\nIf the case uses a legal principle that applies to opinions that are partly true and partly false, then the case considers whether censoring such opinions is constitutional.\nThe first two cases consider whether censoring opinions is constitutional.

{"question": " In Carruther's view, the justification for moral criticism for things that we do (or don't to do) to an animal derives from", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the animal's direct moral standing."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the animals capacity for suffering."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the bad qualities of character that our actions evince."}, {"label": "D", "text": "none of the above"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Carruthers argues that animals have a direct moral standing and that this standing is based on the interests that the animals have as a result of their sentience. So, the justification for moral criticism for things that we do (or don't do) to an animal derives from the animal's direct moral standing."}
{"question": " One way to value a patient's autonomy is by aiming to maximize his or her effective options. When we value a patient's autonomy in this way, what, according to Velleman, do we value?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the patient's opportunities for self-determination"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the patient's capacity for self-determination"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the ability to provide the patient with options"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the ability to share reasons with the patient"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Velleman argues that one way to value autonomy is to aim to maximize the patient's effective options. This means that we value the patient's opportunities for self-determination."}
{"question": " McGrecgor, following Hampton, argues that the harm of rape involves", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "moral injury."}, {"label": "B", "text": "moral morbidity."}, {"label": "C", "text": "moral accident."}, {"label": "D", "text": "moral delusion."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: McGregor argues that the harm of rape involves moral injury. Moral injury is a violation of moral norms that are significant to a person. Rape is a violation of the moral norm that prohibits sexual assault. Because rape is a violation of a significant moral norm, the harm of rape involves moral injury."}
{"question": " On Mill's view, the collision with error makes", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the impression of truth all the clearer."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the impression of error all the clearer."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the impression of distinct ideas clear."}, {"label": "D", "text": "the impression of the state's paternal authority clear."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When error collides with truth, they do not cancel each other out. Instead, they make the impression of truth all the clearer. This happens because the collision with error helps to distinguish between truth and falsehood.\nWhen something is false, it is often easy to see that it is false. But when something is true, it is not always easy to see why it is true. The collision with error helps to clarify why the truth is true.\nSome examples of errors include the belief that the earth is flat and the belief that diseases are caused by witches. Believing these things is not true. But these errors were not obvious at the time. It was only after a collision with truth that they were revealed to be false.\nThe collision with error makes the truth clear. But it also makes the error clear. This is why the collision with error makes the impression of error all the clearer.\nSOLUTION: Look at the question. The question makes the impression of truth all the clearer.\nThe question is asking you to decide what was made clearer by the collision with error. This collision made the truth clearer, which means it made the impression of truth all the clearer."}
{"question": " According to Kass the fact that people (like him) feel repugnance at the thought of human reproductive cloning", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "shows conclusively that reproductive cloning is always wrong."}, {"label": "B", "text": "shows conclusively that reproductive cloning is sometimes wrong."}, {"label": "C", "text": "has nothing to do with the morality of cloning."}, {"label": "D", "text": "is a sign that something is wrong with reproductive cloning."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Kass' feeling of repugnance at the thought of human reproductive cloning does not show conclusively that reproductive cloning is always wrong. To show that cloning is always wrong, Kass would need to argue that feelings of repugnance are a reliable moral guide. But this is not a view that many philosophers accept. Instead, they consider how activities affect values such as well-being, autonomy, and equality.\nCloning does not necessarily affect these values. The fact that some people feel repugnance at the thought of cloning does not mean that cloning is wrong. After all, many people feel repugnance at the thought of consensual incest, but this does not mean that consensual incest is wrong."}
{"question": " Which of the following capacities does Carruther's assume that animals lack?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the capacity for suffering"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the capacity for practical reasoning"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the capacity for rational agency"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the capacity for conscious experience"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Carruther's argument concerns the difference between humans and animals. He claims that animals are incapable of rational agency, and that this is what distinguishes them from humans.\nRational agency is the capacity for practical reasoning. Animals can be trained to do certain things, but this is not the result of their engaging in practical reasoning. It is the result of their associating certain behaviors with specific outcomes.\nSuffering does not require the capacity for practical reasoning. Some animals can be said to suffer.\nConscious experience is not the same as rational agency. Conscious experience is the capacity for conscious experience."}
{"question": " Which of the following best characterizes de Marneffe's view?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The use, sale, and manufacturing of drugs should be legal."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The use, sale, and manufacturing of drugs should be illegal."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The use of drugs should be legal, but the sale and manufacturing of them should be illegal."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The use of drugs should be illegal, but the sale and manufacturing of them should be legal."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: De Marneffe's view is that the use of drugs should be legal, but the sale and manufacturing of them should be illegal. This is a position that supports the legalization of drugs, but wants to limit the commercial aspect of the drug trade."}
{"question": " Wellman's response to the \"egalitarian\" objection to the state's right to exclude is that states can fulfill their duties to outsiders without allowing them into their territory.

For example, air pollution from a wealthy nation can drift across borders and harm people in poor nations.\nAuthoritarian regimes, crime, and unequal social order are not examples of externalities."}

Collins is making a claim about what a care ethics perspective on Wilson's decision would look like. This claim is that a care ethics approach to deliberation would include considering sympathy and attending to concrete particulars."}

This means that our interactions with others are crucial for our development as persons. Confucius believed that by emulating the examples of great persons and through the guidance of familial relationships, one could develop one's own person."}

{"question": " Carens argues that, for example, liberal egalitarianism has nothing to say about the question of whether a black doctor has a moral obligation to practice in a black community.

So, for example, a black doctor would not have a moral obligation to practice in a black community, according to liberal egalitarianism. This is because liberal egalitarianism does not recognize groups or communities as having moral claims on individuals."}

He contends that if one accepts the justification for a single instance of torture in the ticking bomb case, then one is also committed to justifying the practice of torture.\nThe practice of torture involves more than just one instance of torture. So, according to Baron, if one is willing to justify a single instance of torture, then one is also committed to justifying the practice of torture."}
{"question": " According to Cohen, animals are", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "moral agents."}, {"label": "B", "text": "amoral."}, {"label": "C", "text": "abstract reasoners."}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Many people believe that animals are not moral agents. A moral agent is an entity that is capable of making moral decisions.\nAnimals are incapable of making moral decisions because they are incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. Animals can be trained to perform certain tasks, but this is not the same thing as making moral decisions.\nOther people believe that animals are moral agents. These people argue that animals are capable of making moral decisions because they are capable of understanding the consequences of their actions.\nSome animals are more advanced than others in their ability to make moral decisions. For example, dogs are considered to be more advanced than cats.\nSome people believe that animals are amoral. Amoral means that animals do not have a moral code. These people argue that animals only act in their own self-interest.\nOther people believe that animals are abstract reasoners. This means that animals are able to use abstract reasoning to solve problems.\nSOLUTION: According to Cohen, animals are abstract reasoners. This means that animals are able to use abstract reasoning to solve problems."}
{"question": " One objection to care ethics is thatit seems to imply that we areresponsible for our attitudes, even though they seem not to be under our voluntary control.

So, we do not have a moral reason to think that wasteful driving is wrong."}
{"question": " The idea of \"using someone as a mere means\" is centrally relevant to which of the following moral theories?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "consequentialism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kantianism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "utilitarianism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "natural law theory"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Using someone as a mere means is the central concern of Kantianism.\nAccording to Kantianism, the only intrinsically moral thing is a good will. A good will is a will that is always ready to follow the moral law. The moral law is the set of rules that a rational being would agree to follow if they were to enter into a social contract.\nOne of the main things that the moral law forbids is using other people as mere means. To use someone as a mere means is to disregard their inherent value as a person. This is why using someone as a mere means is the central concern of Kantianism."}

According to consequentialist theories of punishment, the purpose of punishment is to produce outcomes that have overall intrinsic value.\nTo produce overall intrinsic value, a punishment must be likely to produce outcomes that are themselves intrinsically valuable. These outcomes might include deterring future crime, expressing societal condemnation, or rehabilitating the offender."}

Kamm does not argue that genetic transformation will actually strengthen the bond between parent and child. Children are too young to understand the implications of genetic enhancement. The use of training and appliances as a way of transforming gifts is not, as Sandel argues, morally permissible."}

He does not argue that abortion is absolutely wrong in all cases. Instead, he claims that in most cases, the mother's interest in having an abortion outweighs the fetus's right to life. However, he acknowledges that there are some cases where the fetus's right to life is strong enough to outweigh the mother's interest in having an abortion. In such cases, he believes that abortion is seriously presumptively wrong."}
{"question": " Michael Gill begins by discussing arguments against autonomy-based justifications of euthanasia. According to these arguments, autonomy-based justifications are contradictory because", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the value of autonomy relates only to the making of big decisions."}, {"label": "B", "text": "terminally ill patients are not capable of freely choosing to end their own lives."}, {"label": "C", "text": "killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions."}, {"label": "D", "text": "above of the above"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Michael Gill begins by discussing arguments against autonomy-based justifications of euthanasia. According to these arguments, autonomy-based justifications are contradictory because they require the terminally ill patient to be both autonomous and not autonomous at the same time. To be autonomous, the patient must be capable of making a free and informed choice. To be not autonomous, the patient must be incapable of making such a choice.\nThese arguments are based on the assumption that autonomy and self-determination require the ability to make choices. If this ability is destroyed, then so is the ability to exercise autonomy. Killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions. So, the fact that a person is terminally ill and cannot choose to end their own life does not mean that they are not autonomous. It means that they are not capable of making a certain choice."}

It is a war that is waged indirectly, through proxies, and through economic and political means. The term comes from the fact that during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a war of ideas and interests, but they were not directly fighting."}
{"question": " Huemer worries that the employment of a \"war\" metaphor when describing government policies about drug use", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "masks a bad argument by analogy."}, {"label": "B", "text": "does not really describe the situation well at all, since it is more like a game than a war."}, {"label": "C", "text": "is perfectly apt."}, {"label": "D", "text": "makes it hard to think and discuss the rights of drug users."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: J. David Vetter, an expert on the legal aspects of drug policy, has written that the government's war on drugs \"is not a metaphor. It is a real war, with real casualties\" (93). The war metaphor is a powerful tool that can be used to justify the government's policies. However, as Huemer notes, the use of the war metaphor can also mask a bad argument by analogy.\nThe war metaphor is apt when it comes to the government's policies on drug use. The government has declared a war on drugs, and it has implemented a variety of policies to fight this war. These policies have included increased surveillance, raids on suspected drug dealers, and the use of military-style tactics and equipment by law enforcement officials. As a result of this war, many people have been incarcerated and many others have died.\nThe war metaphor is not apt when it comes to the government's policies on drug use. The war metaphor is typically used to describe a situation in which one group of people is trying to conquer or destroy another group of people. But the government's policies on drug use do not involve conquest or destruction. Rather, they involve the regulation of drug use. So, the war metaphor is not really descriptive of the situation."}

{"question": " Christopher Heath Wellman defends the position that", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "anti-egalitarianism is compatible with liberal cosmopolitanism."}, {"label": "B", "text": "closing borders to all potential immigrations is an inherently racist social policy."}, {"label": "C", "text": "nation-states have an obligation to open their borders to the least well-off potential immigrants."}, {"label": "D", "text": "nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The focus of the question is on the compatibility of anti-egalitarianism with liberal cosmopolitanism. The other positions relate to immigration and national borders.\nAnti-egalitarianism is incompatible with liberal cosmopolitanism. Liberal cosmopolitanism is a political philosophy that advocates for equal basic rights and respect for different cultures around the world. Anti-egalitarianism is a political philosophy that denies that all people have equal basic rights.\nClosing borders to all potential immigrants is not inherently racist, but it can be racist in effect. A policy is racist if it is implemented in a way that disproportionately harms people on the basis of their race. Border closure can harm people on the basis of their race, but border closure is not inherently racist.\nNation-states have an obligation to open their borders to the least well-off potential immigrants. This position is consistent with liberal cosmopolitanism.\nNation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants. This position is not consistent with liberal cosmopolitanism."}

This duty is based on the concept of justice as reparation, which holds that people have a duty to repair the damage they have done to others.\nImproving oneself with respect to one's own virtue and knowledge is important, but it is not the same as reparation. Improving oneself can help one avoid doing harm to others in the future, but it does not make amends for past wrongs.\nRefraining from harming others is a moral duty, but it is not the same as reparation. Refraining from harming others is a negative duty, which means that it is a duty to not do something. In contrast, reparation is a positive duty, which means that it is a duty to do something.\nShowing gratitude toward one's benefactors is a moral duty, but it is not the same as reparation. Showing gratitude does not involve making amends for past wrongs."}

This means that the purpose of a law is to promote the well-being of a particular society. An ordinance is a law that is particular to a specific situation. An ordinance is not a law in the sense that it is a general rule. Instead, an ordinance is a law that applies to a specific situation.\nSo, the answer is C."}

He believes that abstract arguments are more likely to convince one to act.\nThe underlined part of the passage explains that Singer appeals to both the drowning child and his three-premise argument. The author of the passage believes that Singer wants to appeal to the reader's reason, not just pull at the reader's heartstrings. The author also believes that Singer thinks abstract arguments are more effective at convincing people to act."}

It is a technique that involves transferring the nucleus from an adult somatic cell into an enucleated oocyte. This results in an embryo that contains the nucleus from the adult cell and the cytoplasm from the oocyte.\nAn oocyte is an unfertilized egg.\nThe nucleus that is implanted into the ovum during SCNT is the nucleus from the adult somatic cell. So, an oocyte is not the nucleus that is implanted into the ovum during SCNT.\nThe nucleus that is removed from the ovum during SCNT is the nucleus from the adult somatic cell. So, an oocyte is not the nucleus that is removed from the ovum during SCNT.\nAn undifferentiated stem cell that can be used in treating various medical conditions is a cell that has the ability to differentiate into different types of cells. This cell can be obtained from an oocyte. So, an oocyte is not an undifferentiated stem cell that can be used in treating various medical conditions."}

The harm principle states that the only time the state can interfere with an individual's actions is when they cause harm to others. This principle is based on the idea that individuals have a right to freedom of action as long as they are not harming others.\nThis principle is in line with the ethics of prima facie duty, which holds that individuals have a moral obligation to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. In this view, individuals have a duty to promote the greatest happiness, but this duty is not absolute. Instead, it is a duty to do what will promote the greatest happiness, subject to the qualification that one's own happiness is also to be taken into account.\nThe harm principle is an application of this ethical theory to the role of the state. The harm principle holds that the only time the state can interfere with an individual's actions is when they cause harm to others. This is in line with the ethics of prima facie duty, which holds that individuals have a duty to promote the greatest happiness, subject to the qualification that one's own happiness is also to be taken into account."}

It tells you what Nagel believes.\nNagel clarifies that absolutism is the view that we should prevent murder at all costs. He does not say that we should always do whatever it takes to prevent murder. Rather, he says that the absolutist thinks that the value of preventing murder is so great that we should be willing to pay any cost to do so. This means that the absolutist thinks that there are some costs that we should be willing to incur to prevent murder. But the absolutist does not think that we should incur all costs."}
{"question": " An unjust society, according to John Rawls, can be roughly characterized as any society where", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "some have more goods (e.g., happiness) than others."}, {"label": "B", "text": "political power is mostly given to the wealthy and upper class."}, {"label": "C", "text": "there are inequalities that are not to the benefit of all."}, {"label": "D", "text": "liberty is restricted to those who have not earned it."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: According to Rawls, an unjust society is one in which inequalities benefit some individuals but not others. In other words, if some individuals have more goods (e.g., happiness) than others, that is not necessarily unjust. However, if some individuals have more goods because they were born into wealth or privilege, or because they were able to manipulate the political system to their advantage, then that is unjust.\nSo, the restricted liberty argument does not necessarily fit under the definition of an unjust society, as liberty can be restricted to those who have not earned it for various reasons.\nPolitical power being mostly given to the wealthy and upper class can be unjust if political decisions are made primarily for the benefit of the wealthy and upper class. This would not benefit all members of society.\nSome have more goods (e.g., happiness) than others is not necessarily unjust. For example, some people may be naturally more talented or work harder than others, and so have more goods. This is not unjust.\nThere are inequalities that are not to the benefit of all is the definition of an unjust society. This includes inequalities that are not based on individual choices or abilities. For example, if people are paid differently based on their gender rather than their abilities, that is unjust."}

So, according to McGregor, the expressive harm of rape needs to be intentionally inflicted."}
{"question": " Which of the following is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually."}, {"label": "C", "text": "People's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change."}, {"label": "D", "text": "If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The question is asking you to find the objection that Pence raises that is not addressed by Pritchard's response. Pritchard's response states that SCNT is no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually. This answer choice is not in line with Pence's concerns.\nPence is concerned about people's prejudicial attitudes. This is not an objection that Pritchard directly addresses.\nThe argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism is not an objection that Pence raises.\nIf people's prejudicial attitudes do not change is not an objection that Pence raises. It is a conclusion based on Pence's assumptions.\nPeople's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change is not a direct objection to the argument. It is Pence's conclusion based on his assumptions."}

If an action is not in compliance with the rules, then it is prohibited. If an action is in compliance with the rules but is not consistent with the applicable laws, then it is not permitted under rule consequentialism."}

Utilitarianism is a moral theory that states that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness.\nHappiness is a subjective state. It is different for each individual. So, the principle of utility is not too demanding. It is also not too easy to satisfy.\nSome people think that the principle of utility is too complicated. But, it is not. The principle of utility says to maximize happiness. That is not complicated."}

These obligations arise from our membership in a legitimate self-governing community.\nOur relationships to noncitizens are not within the scope of Macedo's argument. While they may be within the scope of other theories of citizenship, Macedo is not discussing relationships to noncitizens.\nConsequentialist duties to promote the greatest good for the greatest number are not based on membership in a community. They are based on the results of our actions.\nWhile consequentialist duties may include special obligations to fellow citizens, they are not based on the same considerations as these special obligations.\nNothing. Macedo argues that we have special obligations to our fellow citizens."}
{"question": " According to the basic principle of natural law theory, an action is right if and only if (and because)", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the action only indirectly violates some of the basic values."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the action is of a type that the laws of natural selection have favored."}, {"label": "C", "text": "in performing the action one does not directly violate any of the basic values."}, {"label": "D", "text": "none of the above"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Natural law theory is a normative theory. It explains why actions are right or wrong, not by appealing to what people happen to want, but by appealing to values that are supposed to be built into the nature of things.\nAccording to the basic principle of natural law theory, an action is right if and only if (and because) the action does not directly violate any of the basic values. Basic values are the criteria that are used to decide what is right. Natural law theorists identify many basic values, such as the values of liberty, justice, and self-ownership.\nSome of the basic values are not violated by any actions. Other basic values are violated by certain actions. For an action to be right, the action must not directly violate any of the basic values.\nOther things being equal, an action is of a type that the laws of natural selection have favored if the action helps the actor survive or reproduce. But survival and reproduction are not basic values. So, according to natural law theory, an action being of a type that the laws of natural selection have favored is not sufficient for the action to be right.\nAn action only indirectly violates some of the basic values if the action has some good consequences that outweigh the bad consequences. But indirect violations are still violations. So, according to natural law theory, an action only indirectly violating some of the basic values is not sufficient for the action to be right."}

It tells you what was used in reproductive cloning.\nReproductive cloning uses the nucleus of a somatic cell from an adult individual. This nucleus is then placed into an enucleated egg. The egg is then stimulated to begin developing.\nThe individual who donates the nucleus has the same genetic makeup as the clone. The female who donates the egg and the female who carries the zygote to term do not have the same genetic makeup as the clone."}

Therefore, Leopold would not accept the claim that we should ignore all economic motives in deciding questions about land use.\nThe term \"balance of nature\" suggests that there is a natural order that should be maintained. This is a dangerous way of thinking, because it suggests that anything that is not in a so-called \"natural\" state is wrong. So, Leopold would not accept the claim that we should think in terms of \"the balance of nature\" to properly appreciate the value of the natural environment.\nLeopold would agree that many of the problems associated with how we use the environment are economic problems. But he would not agree that all of the problems are economic problems. For example, problems that arise from a lack of respect for the environment, or from a lack of empathy for other beings, are not economic problems."}

He believes that this process is essential for finding the truth.\nAccording to Mill, you don't really know the true view unless you can explain why false views are false. If you can't explain why a view is false, then you don't really understand the true view.\nSo, you don't really know whether or not anything is false."}

Norcross is arguing that if there are actions that we have an obligation not to do, or that we have an obligation to do, then there are also obligations regarding the impact our actions have on the environment. These obligations are derived from the same source as the obligations involving torturing puppies.\nNorcross is not claiming that we have an obligation to reduce our carbon footprint, donate money to Oxfam, not support factory farming, or follow the Golden Rule. He is claiming that if we have an obligation to reduce our carbon footprint, donate money to Oxfam, not support factory farming, or follow the Golden Rule, then we have an obligation to reduce our impact on the environment."}
{"question": " Which of the following is not one of the potentially negative consequences of imposing the death penalty?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the prevention of future murders"}, {"label": "B", "text": "great financial cost"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the incitement effect"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the execution of innocent persons"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The death penalty has several potential negative consequences. One of the consequences is the incitement effect, or the possibility that the death penalty will cause some people to commit murder in order to get that penalty.\nThe prevention of future murders is one of the reasons that some people support the death penalty. But this reason is not a consequence of imposing the death penalty. It is one of the reasons for imposing the death penalty.\nGreat financial cost is a consequence of imposing the death penalty. The appeals process for death penalty cases is long and expensive.\nThe execution of innocent persons is a terrible consequence of any punishment, not just the death penalty."}

It then gives an argument that focuses on the subset of women who are targeted by hate speech. The argument concludes that hate speech that targets a subset of women is misogynistic.\nThe key word in the question is \"consider.\" The question is asking you to consider when certain forms of speech are hate speech. This means that you should think about the argument's logic and whether it supports the claim that hate speech that targets a subset of women is misogynistic.\nThe argument focuses on the idea that hate speech that targets a subset of women is misogynistic. It uses the concept of misogyny to define the speech. It does not deny that subsets of women can be the targets of hate speech. So, the argument does not say that all hate speech that targets a subset of women is sexist but not misogynistic.\nThe argument is not saying that speech that targets a subset of women is never hate speech. It is saying that hate speech that targets a subset of women is misogynistic. So, the argument supports the claim that hate speech that targets a subset of women is hate speech."}

This means that it is more important to prevent someone from killing you than it is to prevent someone from letting you die.\nThe right to noninterference is a right to be left alone. It is a right that is based on the idea that a person has the right to control their own life.\nThe right to goods and services, on the other hand, is a right to receive goods and services from others. This right is not at issue when discussing the killing/letting die distinction."}

It holds that there is a set of moral laws that are built into the nature of things. These moral laws dictate what is right and wrong.\nKantian moral theories are duty-based moral theories. Immanuel Kant believed that our duties are based on the principles of practical reason.\nConsequentialism is not a duty-based moral theory.

As such, it must do at least one of the following: identify the right act to perform, identify the right motive for action, or identify the right character for a moral agent. These are the aims of moral theory.\nTo identify the right act, the principle of moral reasoning must have explanatory power. To identify the right motive, the principle must be practical. And to identify the right character, the principle must be guided by parsimony.\nExplanatory power is the aim of moral theory that the principle of moral reasoning best fulfills. The principle of moral reasoning must be able to explain why a act is right or wrong.\nPractical guidance is the aim of moral theory that the principle of moral reasoning also fulfills. The principle of moral reasoning must be able to tell you what you should do in a particular situation.\nParsimony is the aim of moral theory that the principle of moral reasoning does not fulfill. Parsimony is the aim of a moral theory that aims to identify the right act. But the principle of moral reasoning does not identify the right act."}

One implication of this principle is that individuals should be free to choose their friends and associates based on race. Some people might use this principle to justify immigration policies that exclude entry to members of a given race.

It refers to whether a being has the right to moral consideration.\nA being with direct moral standing has the right to moral consideration directly. This means that we are obliged to consider the interests of these beings when making moral decisions.\nHuman infants, the mentally disabled, and the senile are all examples of beings that some people think should have direct moral standing. This means that they think these beings should have the right to moral consideration directly."}

The argument claims that if this distinction is morally relevant, then the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is also morally relevant.\nThe distinction between killing and letting die is morally relevant. This distinction matters because of the distinction it draws between acts and omissions. Killing someone involves actively doing something to them, while letting die involves passively not doing something for them.\nThe argument claims that the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is also morally relevant. This distinction matters because of the distinction it draws between acts and omissions. Active euthanasia involves actively doing something to end someone's life, while passive euthanasia involves not doing something to keep someone alive."}

He believes that human beings have a special worth or value not because of their beauty, virtue, or praiseworthiness, but because of their dignity. Dignity is the quality of being worthy of respect. It is a kind of status that is owed to a being by virtue of its being a member of the moral community."}

These acts are motivated by sexual desire, which is a selfish desire. They are not acts that respect the autonomy of other persons.\nKant believes that consensual sexual activity outside of marriage is not inherently morally impermissible. This act is not motivated by selfish desire. It is an act that respects the autonomy of other persons."}

It says that people in the U.S. tend to equate what is legal with what is good or harmless.\nAccording to West, people in the U.S. are less likely to recognize harms caused by non-renewable energy sources because they are legal. In other words, people in the U.S. tend to equate what is legal with what is good or harmless."}

They seem to entail that any instance of killing in self-defense is wrong."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both A and B"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Metz argues that capital punishment is degrading and therefore wrong. Dignity-based arguments against capital punishment attempt to show that it is degrading. But they fail, according to Metz.\nOne reason they fail, says Metz, is that they show too much. Some of the things they show are that any instance of killing is wrong and that the death penalty is a form of killing. These conclusions go too far. They entail that self-defense, for example, is wrong.\nAnother reason they fail, says Metz, is that they do not show that the death penalty is degrading. These arguments typically do not show that the death penalty is humiliating or debasing to the person executed."}

If the state could not exclude people from its association, it would not be able to monopolize the use of force within its territory. And without this monopoly, the state would be unable to protect its members' rights. So, the state's right to exclude prospective members is central to its ability to protect the rights of its members.\"\nThe underlined part of the passage explains that the state's right to exclude prospective members is central to its ability to protect the rights of its members. This implies that the state has a right to exclude prospective members from its association."}

She contends that objectification is always harmful, even in cases of what may seem to be benign or positive objectification.\nPapadaki's argument focuses on the narrow view of sexual objectification. She does not argue that objectification is always harmful in all cases, but rather that the narrow view is harmful. Papadaki's argument does not fail to account for cases where there can be unintentional disregard of a person's humanity, cases of benign or positive objectification, or any of the other cases discussed in the prompt."}

It discusses the views of Martha Nussbaum, not Carens. Nussbaum defends a form of cosmopolitanism that is grounded in the value of compassion. This passage does not discuss Carens' views.\nBut in a global society, we are all members of the same species, and we can see the effects of poverty, oppression, or lack of access to education in other parts of the world. As global citizens, we have a duty of compassion to help.\nThis is the ground of a kind of cosmopolitanism that is not anti- national. It is not a matter of denying the importance of national communities, or of ignoring the fact that people often care about their national communities. But it is a matter of adding to the nation-state a broader loyalty, a loyalty to the world as a whole.\nThis global loyalty is not a matter of denying that there are many different cultures in the world. It is a matter of recognizing that the people who belong to different cultures are all human beings, and that they have important human needs in common.\nThe idea is that we should be loyal to the world as a whole, and that we should use our resources to help meet the needs of human beings in other parts of the world."}

{"question": " Little suggests that we should think about the abortion issue in terms of degrees and layers because", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the fetus gains a more certain claim to the right to life over time."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the fetus gains more capacities over time."}, {"label": "C", "text": "a gestating mother is somewhere in between a mere biological mother and a mother in a thick, normative sense."}, {"label": "D", "text": "the gestating mother has different degrees and layers of preferences."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The question invites you to think about the abortion issue in terms of degrees and layers. This approach can help you consider the different points of view that people may have about abortion.\nOne way to think about abortion in terms of degrees and layers is to focus on the capacities of the fetus. Some people think that a fetus has the capacity to feel pain, while others think that a fetus does not have the capacity to feel pain until later in pregnancy. People who have different views on what a fetus can do may have different views on abortion.\nSome people may also consider the gestating mother's preferences. A gestating mother may have different preferences at different points in her pregnancy. For example, she may feel more attached to the fetus as her pregnancy goes on. People who consider the gestating mother's preferences may come to different conclusions about abortion.\nOther people may focus on the mere biological mother and the mother in a thick, normative sense. These terms are used to describe women who have the same body but may have different attitudes or values. The mother in a thick, normative sense may have more at stake in the pregnancy than the mere biological mother. For example, the mother in a thick, normative sense may have a more strongly developed self-concept as a mother. People who consider the differences between these two women may come to different conclusions about abortion.\nFinally, some people may consider the degree to which the pregnancy is wanted. A pregnancy that is wanted may be viewed differently than a pregnancy that is not wanted. People who consider the degree to which a pregnancy is wanted may come to different conclusions about abortion.\nSOLUTION: To think about the abortion issue in terms of degrees and layers, you need to figure out what was mentioned, implied, or required by the passage. The passage mentions the gestating mother's preferences, the capacities of the fetus, and the degree to which the pregnancy is wanted. It does not mention the mere biological mother or the mother in a thick, normative sense.\nThe correct viewpoint is not that the fetus gains more capacities over time. The passage does not discuss the fetus's capacities.\nThe correct viewpoint is not that a gestating mother is somewhere in between a mere biological mother and a mother in a thick, normative sense. This viewpoint is not discussed in the passage.\nThe correct viewpoint is not that the gestating mother has different degrees and layers of preferences. The passage discusses the gestating mother's preferences.\nThe correct viewpoint is that a gestating mother has different degrees and layers of preferences. These preferences may change over time. For example, the gestating mother's preferences about the pregnancy may change as her pregnancy progresses."}

They do not believe in a right to pursue one's own projects, as long as this does not harm others.\nFreedom of speech is not a concern for all liberal egalitarians.\nLiberal egalitarians value freedom of speech, but they do not believe that freedom of speech is an absolute right. They believe that freedom of speech can be limited to protect the equal respect and equal opportunity of all members of society.\nKeeping actual inequalities as small as possible is a concern for all liberal egalitarians.\nAll liberal egalitarians believe that keeping actual inequalities as small as possible is an important goal.
