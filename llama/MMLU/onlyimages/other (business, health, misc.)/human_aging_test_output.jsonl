Optimism is a way of looking at the world that is characterized by the expectation of good rather than bad outcomes. Many people find that as they get older, they become more optimistic.\nThis change may be one of the reasons why older adults are at lower risk of dementia. But it is important to note that changes in optimism are not a definitive sign of dementia. Many people with dementia remain optimistic. And some people without dementia become less optimistic.\nSOLUTION: These changes in optimism may be a warning sign of dementia. But they may also be a natural part of aging. If you are an older adult, it is important to communicate with your doctor about any changes in your thinking and behavior."}

Bone density can be used to predict the risk of breaking a bone.\nSome people have a higher risk of losing bone density than others. This question focuses on the factors that are most strongly associated with a higher risk of losing bone density.\nLifestyle factors are a well-established risk factor for bone loss. Not getting enough exercise and not consuming enough calcium are both examples of lifestyle factors that can lead to bone loss.\nHormonal factors can also affect bone density. For example, menopause can lead to a decrease in estrogen levels, which can increase the risk of bone loss.\nCohort factors are a type of risk factor that tells you about the effect of a disease. In this case, cohort factors are telling you about the effect of aging. As people age, they have a higher risk of bone loss.\nGenetic factors are inherited traits. They can include things like a predisposition to certain diseases. Some genetic factors can affect bone density, but they are not as strongly associated with bone loss as the other factors listed here."}

Age is a common characteristic used to define cohorts. Cohorts are different than age groups, which are groups of people who share the same age.\nCohorts can be formed on the basis of whatever characteristic is relevant. For example, people who are born during the same years are a cohort. So are people who were in the same military unit, or who were treated with the same drug.\nSOLUTION: The question tells you that this difference is mostly related to cohort rather than age. So, these groups are cohorts, not age groups.\nThe question also tells you that rates of dementia are a difference that is mostly related to cohort. Dementia is a condition that affects cognitive abilities. It is not uncommon for rates of dementia to differ among cohorts. For example, people who are 80 years old now may be at a lower risk of dementia than people who are 80 years old were in the past.\nWork productivity is not a difference that is mostly related to cohort. Work productivity can be affected by many factors, including age. But work productivity is not a characteristic that is used to define a cohort.\nPersonality traits and coping strategies are characteristics that can be used to define a cohort. But the question tells you that rates of dementia are a difference that is mostly related to cohort. So, rates of dementia are the difference that is mostly cohort, not personality traits or coping strategies."}

This means that even though extremely emotional support can be helpful, support that is overly emotional may not be as helpful.\nExternal support is not as effective as internal support. This means that being part of a community and receiving support from friends and family is more helpful than receiving the same support from a healthcare provider.\nUnexpected support can be helpful, but it is not as helpful as support that is perceived as regular and ongoing."}
{"question": "Free radicals are produced by", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Normal metabolism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Excess consumption of Vitamins A and C"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lack of sunlight"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A weakened immune system"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Antioxidants are substances that inhibit the oxidation of other substances. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals, which are highly reactive substances. Free radicals can damage cells and are believed to play a role in many diseases, including cancer and heart disease.\nFree radicals are produced by normal metabolism. They are also produced by environmental factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke and radiation. Certain medications and activities such as strenuous exercise may also produce free radicals.\nSOLUTION: Vitamins A and C are antioxidants that can protect cells from damage by free radicals. But taking excess amounts of these vitamins can actually increase the production of free radicals. So, excess consumption of Vitamins A and C can lead to an increase in free radicals.\nLack of sunlight does not directly produce free radicals. But lack of sunlight may contribute to a lack of vitamin D, which is an antioxidant that can protect cells from damage by free radicals.\nA weakened immune system may not directly produce free radicals. But a weakened immune system may make it harder for the body to fight off diseases that may produce free radicals."}

The questions are designed to make people think about their attitudes and behaviors, and to reveal their motivations and needs.\nOne of the benefits of projective tests is that they can provide information about an individual's unconscious thoughts and feelings. Because people's responses to projective tests are open to interpretation, the tests can reveal things that people may not be aware of.\nHowever, projective tests are not as reliable as objective tests. This means that projective tests may not provide consistent results.\nOne reason for the lower reliability of projective tests is that the interpretations of projective test results are subjective. This means that the results can be influenced by the test administrator's biases and by the test taker's behavior during the test.\nAnother reason is that projective tests are more visual. This means that the results are based on pictures or images that are shown to the test taker. These tests are more prone to errors in interpretation."}

Research has found that people tend to hold more positive stereotypes of older people than negative ones. So, positive age stereotypes are stronger than negative ones."}
{"question": "Which of the following could very well be a cohort difference rather than a change that occurs with age?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Differences in weight"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Shrinkage of the thymus gland"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Enlargement of the heart"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increasing size of nose and ears"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Cohorts are groups of people who share some social or cultural experience. Cohorts can be formed on the basis of age, gender, ethnicity, or other factors.\nCohort effects occur when events or experiences that are common to a cohort affect the values or behaviors of individuals in that cohort. Cohort effects can include both positive and negative outcomes.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is A.\nWeight is a common cohort effect. People's weights can be different among different cohorts because of differing social or cultural norms about weight.\nThe thymus gland is a gland that is active in children but tends to shrink in size in adults. So, shrinkage of the thymus gland is not a cohort effect; it is a normal change that occurs with age.\nThe heart does not get larger as a person gets older. So, enlargement of the heart is not a cohort effect.\nAs people get older, their noses and ears may increase in size. So, increasing size of nose and ears is not a cohort effect. It is a normal change that occurs with age."}

Experiments can be designed to examine either age differences or cohort differences.\nExperiments can examine age differences by comparing participants of different ages to each other. For example, an experiment could compare high school students to college students to examine the effect of age on critical thinking.\nExperiments can examine cohort differences by comparing participants from different birth cohorts to each other. For example, an experiment could compare participants born in 2005 to participants born in 1995 to examine the effect of cohort on educational attainment.\nIn contrast, observational studies are designed to examine both age and cohort differences.\nAn observational study of a group of elderly people over time would examine age differences between the participants at different time points. For example, the study could compare the participants' health at different time points to examine how health changes with age.\nAt the same time, an observational study can also examine cohort differences by comparing the participants to people in other birth cohorts. For example, an observational study of a group of people born in 1950 could compare them to people born in 1970 to examine the effect of cohort on health.\n\nCross-sectional designs are similar to observational studies in that they can examine both age and cohort differences. A cross-sectional design examines a group of participants at a single time point.\nFor example, a cross-sectional study of a group of people born in 1950 could examine the relationship between birth cohort and educational attainment.\nAnother example of a cross-sectional design is a survey that asks participants of different ages to compare their experiences. This design can examine age differences by comparing participants of different ages to each other. It can also examine cohort differences by comparing participants to people in other birth cohorts.\n\nA correlational design can examine associations between variables, but it cannot examine cause-and-effect relationships. So, a correlational design cannot examine age differences or cohort differences.\nFor example, a correlational study might find that people who watch more TV also have higher BMIs. But, this study cannot determine whether watching more TV causes people to have higher BMIs, or whether people with higher BMIs watch more TV.\n\nA quasi-experimental design is a type of experimental design that is not randomized. So, a quasi-experimental design cannot examine age differences or cohort differences.\nFor example, an experimental study that compared students who received additional tutoring to students who did not received additional tutoring would be a quasi-experimental design. This design could not examine age differences or cohort differences because the tutoring was not randomized. Some students who received additional tutoring may have been born earlier than some students who did not receive additional tutoring."}

These theories describe development as a series of discrete stages that an organism must move through. They see each stage as a significant change in the organism. For example, the theory of psychosocial development by Erik Erikson describes eight stages of development, each with its own specific psychological challenge.\nOther theories suggest that development proceeds in a smooth, continuous manner. These theories describe development as a continuous process in which the organism gradually changes. They see each stage as a gradual change, rather than a specific leap. For example, the theory of evolution by natural selection describes development as a continuous process in which organisms slowly change over many generations.\nSOLUTION: Theories that suggest that development proceeds in a step-by-step manner are mechanistic. They see development as a series of significant changes.\nTheories that suggest that development proceeds in a smooth, continuous manner are organismic. They see development as a continuous process in which the organism gradually changes."}

One important factor is genetics.\nSOLUTION: It is not appropriate to make predictions about how long an individual will live based on their race or gender.\nGenetics play a role in how long a person will live. But other factors, such as lifestyle choices and access to healthcare, are also important.\nSome people may be inclined to use generalizations about race or gender to make predictions. For example, they may think that black men have a lower life expectancy than white men. Or that white women live longer than black women.\nBut these generalizations are not always true. They are based on data that shows average life expectancy for each group. They do not show whether any individual will live longer or shorter than expected.\nLife expectancy is just an average. It can be influenced by many factors, including access to healthcare, lifestyle choices, and family history.\nSome people may have a higher risk of early death than others. For example, a black man may have a higher risk of early death than a white man. But this does not mean that he will live shorter than a white man. It means that, on average, black men have a shorter life expectancy than white men.\nOther factors, such as lifestyle choices and access to healthcare, can affect how long a person will live.

In science, theories can include both natural phenomena and the roles that human behaviors play in those phenomena.\nTheories may include the following elements:\n\u2022 Explanations of what happens: Theories may include explanations of how and why particular events or phenomena occur.\n\u2022 Predictions: Many theories include predictions. These predictions may describe what will happen in future research or in certain situations.\n\u2022 Mechanisms: Mechanisms are the specific ways that a theory says a phenomenon occurs. Mechanisms may include causal pathways, or the steps that lead to an outcome.\nTheories can be tested in a variety of ways, including by conducting research and collecting data. How well a theory fits the evidence that is collected is often used to determine whether the theory is consistent with the evidence.\nSOLUTION: Theories are important in aging research for several reasons:\nTheories can help explain what happens as people age. This can include explanations of why people may experience certain changes as they get older.\nTheories can also help identify potential causes of aging. By describing the mechanisms that link particular events to aging, theories can help researchers identify potential ways to prevent or treat age-related diseases.\nTheories can guide future research. By suggesting what has not been tested or what needs further study, theories can help researchers design studies to answer specific questions.\nTheories have been tested in many ways. For example, researchers have tested theories by collecting data from human populations, from animal studies, and from cellular studies.\nTests of theories may include both experimental and observational studies. Experimental studies can include randomized controlled trials, while observational studies may include cross-sectional and cohort studies.\nTests of theories may also include studies of mechanisms. For example, researchers have tested theories about how inflammation affects aging by studying the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs in cellular studies and in animal studies."}

They can see how group members interact. They can also see how the group reaches decisions.\nActive Observers\nActive observers also take part in the situation they are observing. But, they do not become part of the group. Instead, they observe from the outside.\nWhile active observers might keep notes, they do not talk to group members. They do not attend meetings or join in activities.\nBecause active observers do not participate, they may not learn as much as participant observers. But, they may be able to stay more separate from the group they study. This can make it easier to keep notes and be objective.\nIndiscreet Observers\nIndiscreet observers are also called naive observers. Like active observers, they do not participate in the situation they are observing. But, they may not know how to be invisible. They may talk to group members, or make assumptions that are not true.\nThis can change the situation the observer is studying. It can also change the way group members behave. As a result, the observations may not be accurate.\nMeddling Observers\nMeddling observers interfere with the situation they are observing. This is not good research practice.\nMeddling observers can affect what happens. They may change the behavior of the people they are studying. This can make it hard to get accurate information."}

For example, a person's sense of self may become clearer as they age.\nSOLUTION: Traits, coping strategies, and personal concerns can all show change with age. But change in these areas may not reflect a change in the level of personality description. For example, a change in trait levels may be due to age-related declines in cognitive functioning.\nA change in identity, on the other hand, may reflect a change in the level of personality description. As individuals age, they may change their sense of self, for example, by entering a new stage of life (e.g., retirement)."}

One reason for this may be the social support that comes from being part of a religious community. In addition, some religions have rules that encourage healthy behaviors, such as not smoking or drinking alcohol. However, the positive relationship between religion and physical health is not thought to be due to these factors.\nStudies have shown that people who attend religious services regularly have better physical health, even when they are not drinking alcohol or following other healthy rules. This suggests that the positive relationship between religion and physical health is due to other factors.\nOne such factor is the stress-reducing effects of prayerful meditation. Religious practices such as prayer and meditation may help lower stress levels, which can have a positive impact on physical health.\nAnother factor is the benefits of knowing that others are praying for you. Believing that others are praying for your health may give you a sense of comfort and security, which can have a positive impact on your health."}

It is important to note that the criteria for assisted suicide can vary depending on the location. In the United States, for example, assisted suicide is legal in Oregon and Washington. In these locations, a person with a terminal illness with six months or less to live can receive a prescription for lethal medication. In other locations, assisted suicide is not legal.\nA person with a terminal illness with six months or less to live may choose to use physician-assisted suicide. In the United States, the most common reason that people give for choosing assisted suicide is that they do not want to suffer. Many people who choose assisted suicide say that they want to have control over how they die. Other people choose assisted suicide because they are afraid of losing their dignity or becoming a burden on their family.\nNo family: Assistant: LECTURE: Most people who have used physician-assistant suicide have had at least one of the following:\na terminal illness with a prognosis of 6 months or less to live\nuntreatable pain or suffering\nloss of functional ability\nThese criteria may vary depending on the location. In the United States, for example, a person with a terminal illness with six months or less to live can use physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and Washington.\nIn contrast, a person who is not terminally ill may not use physician-assistant suicide. For example, a person with a lifelong disability may not use physician-assistant suicide.\nSome people may choose physician-assistant suicide because they have no family. However, this is not a criterion for using physician-assistant suicide.\nMany people who choose physician-assistant suicide have a terminal illness with a prognosis of 6 months or less to live. For these people, the illness is the cause of their suffering.\nIn contrast, depression is a mental illness. It is not a terminal illness. Depression can make people think about dying, but it is not the same as having a terminal illness.\nIf a person has depression, they may have trouble enjoying life. They may also have trouble sleeping or eating. But with treatment, people with depression can get better.\nSome people may choose physician-assistant suicide because they have depression. But depression is not a terminal illness. So, depression is not a criterion for using physician-assistant suicide."}

Age can affect reaction time in different ways.\nAs people age, their reaction time tends to get longer. This increase in reaction time is usually seen on complex tasks.\nComplex tasks require more thinking and decision-making. They also require more time to finish. So, it makes sense that older people would have longer reaction times on complex tasks.\nChoice reaction time is the time it takes a person to choose among several options. This type of reaction time tends to get shorter as people age.\nChoice reaction time gets shorter because people become more experienced in making decisions. They become better at identifying what is important and what is not.\nElaborate reaction time is the time it takes a person to add details to a response. As people age, their elaboration tends to decrease. So, their reaction time on elaborate tasks gets shorter.\nSimple reaction time is the time it takes a person to see a stimulus and respond to it. As people age, their simple reaction time tends to get longer.\nSOLUTION: Biggest age differences occur with complex reaction time.

For example, if a patient has high blood pressure, a link between high blood pressure and heart disease tells the doctor that the patient is at higher risk for heart disease.\nIf a link is found between a disease and a risk factor, it does not mean that taking medication for the risk factor will prevent the disease. For example, if a link is found between heart disease and high blood pressure, taking medication to lower your blood pressure will not necessarily prevent heart disease.\nIf a link is found between a disease and a risk factor, it does not mean that avoiding the risk factor will necessarily prevent the disease. For example, if a link is found between lung cancer and smoking, avoiding smoking will not necessarily prevent lung cancer.\nIf a link is found between a disease and a risk factor, it does not mean that paying more for medications will help prevent the disease. For example, if a link is found between heart disease and high blood pressure, paying more for medications will not necessarily help prevent heart disease.\nIf a link is found between a disease and a risk factor, it does not mean that you can choose to get certain diseases. For example, if a link is found between smoking and lung cancer, you cannot choose to get lung cancer by smoking."}

These components work together to process information.\nOne component of memory is sensory memory. This type of memory holds information that is being processed. Sensory memory has a short-term duration.\nAnother component of memory is short-term memory. This type of memory holds information that is being processed for a short time.\nFinally, long-term memory is the component of memory that holds information for a long time.\nThe different components of memory work together to process information. For example, when you read a book, your sensory memory holds the information that you are reading. Your short-term memory then processes this information. And, the information that you are not actively using is stored in your long-term memory."}

{"question": "One line of evidence against antagonistic pleiotropy is that", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Women who have more children tend to live longer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Some animals show little or no senescence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Even tissue cells with longer telomere strands can show senescence"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Exercise increases rather than decreases longevity"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Antagonistic pleiotropy is a theory that explains why natural selection acts on a gene to create a trait that has opposite effects in different parts of an organism. One line of evidence against antagonistic pleiotropy is that some animals show little or no senescence. Senescence is the decline in biological function that occurs with age. If antagonistic pleiotropy were true, we would expect to see senescence affect all animals, including those that have longer telomere strands. But the fact that some animals show little or no senescence is evidence that senescence is not affected by telomere length. So, the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy is not supported by the evidence."}

Also, the loss of a spouse can result in the loss of a source of social support, which can increase the risk of depression."}
{"question": "Which of the following factors has NOT received as much support as the others in research investigating why social support is related to better health?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Social"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Behavioral"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Psychological"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gerontological"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Social support is a key factor in the relationship between social and health.\nThere are many different types of social support, including social assistance, emotional support, informational support, and companionship. Each type of support may affect health differently. For example, social assistance, or help with basic needs, has been found to affect health in different ways than companionship, or spending time with friends.\nThe graph below shows how each type of support has been studied in research.\nAs the graph shows, social support has received a lot of research attention overall. But the specific types of support that have been studied the most are social assistance and companionship.\nBehaviors and psychological and gerontological factors have also been studied in relation to social support and health. But they have received less research attention than the social support types.\nSo, the psychological type of support has received less support than the other types of social support in research investigating the relationship between social support and health."}

Older adults are often highly skilled at coping with problems, but the strategies that are most effective for them may change as they age.\nSome older adults may have developed a repertoire of effective strategies over their lifetime. For these individuals, their coping strategies are generally effective at solving problems.\nOther older adults may have more strategies to draw upon, but the effectiveness of their coping strategies may be variable. In this case, their strategies are not always effective at solving problems.\nSome older adults may be persistent, using the same strategy over and over until they solve the problem. While persistence can be an effective coping strategy, using the same strategy over and over is not always effective.\nOlder adults may sometimes use narrow coping strategies, ignoring many aspects of the problem. Using a narrow coping strategy may help solve the problem, but it may also lead to an inability to solve the problem or to experience with the problem."}

So, if adult age is significantly and positively correlated with consumption of herbal teas, this means that as adult age increases, herbal tea consumption also increases.\nHere are the other choices and why they are not the correct answer:\nBecoming older causes one to begin or increase consumption of herbal teas.\nThis answer confuses causation with correlation. Just because one thing happens before another thing does not mean that the first thing causes the second thing.\nOlder adults drink less herbal tea than do younger adults.\nThis answer contradicts the positive correlation described in the problem. A negative correlation would have been described as older adults drinking more herbal tea than do younger adults.\nOlder adults drink more herbal tea than do younger adults.\nThis answer is consistent with the positive correlation described in the problem.\nDrinking herbal teas makes one grow older more slowly.\nThis answer is wrong for two reasons. First, growing older slowly does not have the same units as adult age. Second, the problem described a positive correlation between adult age and herbal tea consumption, not a correlation between herbal tea consumption and growing older slowly."}

For example, sleep-deprived people may have trouble concentrating or have an increased chance of making mistakes.\nImproving sleep quality can help a person feel more rested and alert. But sleep quality is a subjective measure, and different people may have different ideas about what constitutes good sleep. So, improving sleep quality may not necessarily lead to improved attention the next day.\nIncreased irritability is a common effect of sleep deprivation. People who are sleep-deprived may become more easily frustrated or annoyed.\nWeight and sleep are related. For example, people may eat more when they are sleep-deprived. But an increase in weight is not as specific to sleep deprivation as are some of the other choices."}

The retirement community model, created by Dr. Bill Thomas, describes these phases as retirees age. The phases are:\n1. The socialization phase: People move to a retirement community to be with others.\n2. The disenchantment phase: New retirees may feel a sense of disillusionment when they realize that their new community is not as social as they had thought.\n3. The honeymoon phase: As new retirees begin to socialize and get involved in the community, they may experience a honeymoon phase in which they are particularly happy with their decision to move to the community.\n4. The routine phase: For many retirees, the socialization phase ends and the routine phase begins. Retirees may continue to be happy in their community, but they may be less involved in social activities.\n5. The independence phase: In this phase, retirees may have some mobility issues or other health problems. They may need some help with daily activities, but they can still live on their own in their home.\nThe retirement routine phase is the phase that occurs most frequently. This means that it is the phase that the majority of retirees will experience the most often.\nThe disenchantment phase occurs less frequently than the retirement routine phase. This means that it is the phase that the majority of retirees will experience, but not as often as the retirement routine phase.\nThe preretirement phase occurs the least frequently. This means that it is the phase that the majority of retirees will not experience.\nThe honeymoon phase occurs less frequently than the retirement routine phase.

This means that as we age, we may gain new skills or knowledge, but also experience losses such as the decline in cognitive abilities.\nSome aspects of development may show no overall change over time. For example, our weight may fluctuate but eventually settle at a stable level. In this case, each gain in weight is offset by a loss, so there is no overall change.\nGains and losses can occur at the same time. For example, as a child gains independence, they may also experience a loss of dependence on their parents.\nGains and losses are both important. It is difficult to say that gains are far more important than losses. They are both important aspects of development."}

This fluid helps carry sperm from the testicles to the penis.\nProstate cancer is a common disease in older men. One of the main signs of prostate cancer is difficulty urinating.\nSOLUTION: An increased frequency of urination in older adults is most likely caused by kidney problems.\nThe kidneys help regulate the amount of water and salt in the body. They do this by filtering the blood and removing excess water and salt.\nKidney problems can interfere with this filtering process. When the kidneys are not working properly, water and salt may not be removed from the body. This can cause the body to retain water and produce more urine.\nProstate cancer and a smaller bladder can also cause difficulty urinating. But they are less likely to cause an increased frequency of urination.\nGallstones do not typically cause problems with urination."}

It also does not depend on whether the measure really measures anything at all, or whether the measure is really measuring what it claims to measure."}
{"question": "A problem in comparing older adults' memory for recent events and events that happened a long time ago is that recent events", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "May be very well rehearsed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Are far more meaningful"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Have no denominator to help in computing an average"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Can be verified while older events often cannot"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Memory for recent events and memory for older events may be different in some respects.\nRecent events are often better rehearsed. We may rehearse recent events in great detail, so they are easier to remember.\nRecent events are far more meaningful. Events that happened recently are often more important to us than events that happened a long time ago.\nAverage memory for recent events may be higher. The average memory for recent events may be higher than the average memory for older events. This is because people can rehearse recent events more often, which can help them remember them better.\nYou can verify recent events. You can easily verify recent events by checking records or by asking other people who were there.\nOlder events often cannot be verified. It may be harder to verify the details of older events. For example, you may not have written records for social events you attended a few months ago."}
{"question": "Of the following types of memory, which shows the biggest deficit with advanced age?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sensory memory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Episodic memory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Semantic memory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Procedural memory"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Memory is the process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information. Psychologists use different types of cues to categorize memory:\nSensory memory: This is the first stage of memory. Sensory memory holds information that has just come in through the senses. It has a brief duration.\nEpisodic memory: This type of memory includes autobiographical events. Episodic memory is the story of your life.\nSemantic memory: This type of memory includes facts and knowledge that you have learned. Semantic memory is not tied to a specific event.\nProcedural memory: This type of memory is involved in learning new skills. Procedural memory tells you how to do something.\nThe correct answer is C.\nSemantic memory is the type of memory that shows the biggest deficit with advanced age. As people get older, they often have trouble recalling facts and information. This type of memory loss is called semantic memory loss."}
{"question": "The loss of a ____ is regarded in the U.

Telomeres are the repetitive sequences of DNA at the ends of chromosomes.\nTelomeres act as protective caps. They prevent chromosomes from deteriorating and sticking to each other.\nAs cells age, telomerase helps to maintain the length of telomeres. But in most cells, telomerase is active only in embryonic cells and in cells that are rapidly dividing.\nSo, for most cells, every time a cell divides, a bit of its telomere is lost. This process helps to limit the number of times a cell can divide.\nSOLUTION: Telomerase can lengthen telomeres. So, telomerase can help cells avoid senescence by maintaining the length of telomeres."}

The strength of these connections is called a synaptic connection.\nWhen a neuron needs to transmit information to another neuron, it does so by sending a electrical signal down the synaptic connection. The strength of the synaptic connection determines how well the neurons will respond to each other.\nThe more a synaptic connection is used, the stronger it becomes. This strengthening happens because the growth and survival of neurons are dependent on the use of the synaptic connections.\nWhen a neuron needs to make a memory, it does so by changing the strength of synaptic connections. This change in strength is what forms the memory.\nThe memory is always stored as a change in the strength of synaptic connections. So, the information is always changed when it is stored."}
