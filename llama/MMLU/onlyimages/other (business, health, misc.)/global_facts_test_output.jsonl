{"question": "What was GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "About $300"}, {"label": "B", "text": "About $3k"}, {"label": "C", "text": "About $8k"}, {"label": "D", "text": "About $15k"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: GDP per capita is a measure of the economy's average output per person. In order to determine what GDP per capita was in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, you need to compare the value of the United States' GDP in 1850 to its population in 1850 and then divide that by the population of 2011.\nYou can use the following formula to find GDP per capita:\nGDP per capita = GDP / population\nYou can use the CPI Inflation Calculator to adjust the GDP for inflation. The calculator uses the GDP deflator, which is a measure of the average price level of goods and services in the economy. The GDP deflator is a more accurate measure of inflation than the CPI.\nFirst, convert the GDP to a 2011 US dollar amount.\nAccording to the table, the GDP in 1850 was $4.8 billion. To convert this to 2011 US dollars, you can use the CPI Inflation Calculator:\n$4.8 billion / (1850 CPI) = $587.7 billion / (2011 CPI) = $14,562 in 2011 US dollars.\nThen, divide the 2011 US dollar GDP by the 2011 US population to find the GDP per capita in 2011.\n$14,562 / 309,000,000 = $48 in 2011 US dollars.\nFinally, use the PPP conversion factor to convert 2011 US dollars to 2011 PPP dollars.\n$48 / 0.731 = $66.1 in 2011 PPP dollars.\nSo, GDP per capita in 1850 was about $66.1 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices."}

One way this can be done is by implementing a policy of redistribution-with-growth. The idea behind this approach is that by helping the poor, they will be able to take advantage of economic growth and eventually rise out of poverty.\nOne of the key features of the redistribution-with-growth policy approach is that it seeks to increase access to education. This is because education is seen as a key to unlocking the potential of the poor. By providing education, they will be better able to take advantage of economic opportunities and improve their economic situation.\nThe other elements of the redistribution-with-growth policy approach are:\n- progressive taxation, which involves imposing higher tax rates on people with higher incomes. This seeks to redistribute income by taking money from people with higher incomes and giving it to people with lower incomes.\n- land reform, which involves changing the way that land is owned and distributed. This can include redistributing land from wealthy landowners to poor farmers, as well as regulating the rent of land to ensure that it is affordable for poor farmers.\n- minimum wage legislation, which involves setting a minimum rate for wages. This seeks to redistribute income by ensuring that low-wage workers earn a higher wage."}

To determine the approximate difference in approval between the South and the rest of the United States, calculate the percent difference between the two numbers.\n60% - 80% = -20%\nThe percent difference is a measure of the difference between two numbers as a proportion of those numbers. It is a way to describe the magnitude of the difference.\nTo describe the magnitude of the difference in approval of school desegregation between the South and the rest of the United States, use the percent difference:\n-20% = -20% / 20% = -1.\nThus, the approval of school desegregation was 1% lower in the South than in the rest of the United States."}
