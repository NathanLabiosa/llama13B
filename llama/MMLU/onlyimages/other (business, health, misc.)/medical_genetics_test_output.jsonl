This RNA copy, or transcript, can then be used as a template to create a protein.\nOne of the steps in this process is the binding of a transcription factor to the DNA. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences. They can either stimulate or inhibit the transcription of a gene, depending on whether they are activating or repressing transcription.\nZinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are two types of transcription factors.\nZinc finger proteins are involved in the control of translation.\nZinc finger proteins are proteins that bind to DNA. They get their name from the zinc ions that are a part of their structure. Zinc finger proteins can bind to DNA with high specificity, meaning that they can bind to a specific piece of DNA.\nHelix-turn-helix proteins are components of ribosomes.\nHelix-turn-helix proteins get their name from the structure of their amino acid sequences. These protein sequences can bind to DNA. In fact, some helix-turn-helix proteins are transcription factors.

The graph has two types, or alleles, of a gene. The phenotype is the combination of the two alleles' versions of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype is a dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype is a recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nAn organism's expected phenotype is called its expected frequency. To calculate how many organisms in a population are expected to have a certain phenotype, consider whether the phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the gene's trait. Then, consider how many organisms in the population have that genotype.\nIf most organisms in the population have the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait, then the expected frequency of the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait is 1.\nIf most organisms in the population have the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait, then the expected frequency of the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait is 1.\nThe expected frequency of a phenotype is 1 if and only if the phenotype is the only way the gene's trait can appear in the population.\nAn X-linked recessive condition is a condition that affects a gene on the X chromosome. Because it is recessive, the condition will only affect an organism if it has the recessive version of the gene's trait.\nIf a human is affected with an X-linked recessive condition, they must have at least one recessive allele for the gene that affects the condition. This means that the human must have the recessive version of the gene's trait.\nSOLUTION: The frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition is .10, or 10%. This means that out of every 100 humans, 10 are affected with the condition.\nAll of the people who are affected with the condition are males. So, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.

An organism's phenotype is a set of traits. Both genotype and phenotype can affect an organism's behavior and physical traits.\nGenotype and phenotype can be described in terms of how an organism's genes interact with each other. One way to describe this interaction is to look at the pattern of inheritance.\nThe pattern of inheritance describes how a trait is passed down from parents to offspring. The table in the following link shows patterns of inheritance.\n | Autosomal | X-linked\ndominant |  |\nrecessive |  |\nY-linked |  |\nThe table shows that dominant inheritance means that a gene with a dominant allele has a greater effect on a trait than a gene with a recessive allele. If a gene with a dominant allele is present in an organism's genotype, the organism's phenotype will show the allele's dominant allele's version of the trait.\nRecessive inheritance means that a gene with a recessive allele has a greater effect on a trait than a gene with a dominant allele. If a gene with a recessive allele is present in an organism's genotype, the organism's phenotype will show the allele's recessive allele's version of the trait.\nX-linked inheritance happens when a gene affects a trait on an allele located on the X chromosome. Because there are two X chromosomes in the genotype of most male organisms, one of the X chromosomes will have a dominant allele for a gene. The other X chromosome will have a recessive allele for the gene.\nY-linked inheritance happens when a gene affects a trait on an allele located on the Y chromosome. Because there are no Y chromosomes in the genotype of most female organisms, Y-linked inheritance does not affect female organisms.\nSOLUTION: G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive allele.

So, a Punnett organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have offspring with the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nAn organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have a recessive allele in its genotype for that gene. So, a Punnett organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have offspring with the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA 1:2:1 ratio of offspring types means that the F1 progeny are not pure for either the dark blue or bright white phenotype. This means that the F1 progeny have some dominant and some recessive alleles in their genotype for the gene that affects flower color.\nThe table shows that a Punnett organism with the genotype Ff has offspring with the dominant phenotype. So, the F1 progeny are not pure for the dark blue phenotype. This means that the dark blue phenotype is dominant.\nThe table also shows that a Punnett organism with the genotype FF or Ff has offspring with the bright white phenotype. So, the bright white phenotype is recessive.\nBecause the dark blue phenotype is dominant and the bright white phenotype is recessive, a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is consistent with the following genotypes: FF, Ff, and ff.\nEpistasis is a genetic phenomenon in which one gene affects the expression of one or more other genes. Epistasis does not explain the 1:2:1 ratio of offspring types in this cross.\nIncomplete dominance is a genetic phenomenon in which an organism's phenotype is intermediate between the dominant and recessive alleles' versions of a gene's trait. Incomplete dominance does not explain the 1:2:1 ratio of offspring types in this cross.\nCodominance is a genetic phenomenon in which an organism's genotype has both dominant and recessive alleles for a gene, and both alleles' versions of the gene's trait are expressed as the organism's phenotype. Codominance does not explain the 1:2:1 ratio of offspring types in this cross.\nInbreeding depression is a decrease in an organism's fitness.

When there is inbreeding, offspring genotypes will be more similar to each other than to the genotypes of offspring produced by outcrossing. This increased similarity among offspring will reduce the variation present in the population.\nAn increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, will increase the proportion of genes that are homozygous. Homozygous genes have the same allele in both copies of the gene. These genes show linkage. So, a higher proportion of genes that show linkage is likely to result from an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F.\nAn increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is also likely to result in a higher proportion of genes with introns. Introns are noncoding DNA. They increase in proportion when there is inbreeding. This is because inbreeding increases the probability that alleles for genes that have introns will be homozygous.\nThe level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells is not affected by the inbreeding coefficient, F."}

Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff.

Carrier screening can be done for many disorders, including cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and Tay-Sachs disease.\nCarrier screening is typically used to screen people who are considering having children. The results of the carrier screening can be used to determine the risk of having children with a genetic disorder.\nSome disorders are not suitable for carrier screening. This is because carrier screening is looking for people who are carriers of a gene for a disorder. For most disorders, a person can be a carrier only if he or she has a gene for the disorder.\nSome disorders are caused by a change in a single gene. For these disorders, a person is either a carrier or not a carrier. Carrier screening can identify carriers.\nOther disorders are caused by changes in multiple genes.

In this case, the Punnett organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nX-linked inheritance is a type of inheritance where alleles for genes on the X chromosome are inherited. Because there are multiple alleles for many genes on the X chromosome, X-linked inheritance can affect how an organism's genotype affects its phenotype.\nSome diseases are caused by alleles on the X chromosome. Because these alleles are on the X chromosome, they are inherited in a way that is called X-linked inheritance. In X-linked inheritance, a disease-causing allele will be inherited by an organism only if it is on the X chromosome.\nSOLUTION: Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that to inherit the disease, an organism must have a genotype with at least one recessive allele for the haemophilia gene. The only way to have a recessive allele for a gene is to have a genotype with only recessive alleles for that gene.\nSo, to inherit haemophilia, an organism must have the genotype Ff. If an organism has the genotype Ff, it will have the recessive allele's version of the haemophilia gene's trait.

Trisomy 21, which is characterized by an extra copy of chromosome 21, is the most common trisomy and is known as Down syndrome. It is caused by a 47,XX,+21 karyotype.\nTrisomy 21 has the mildest effect on human development of any of the trisomy karyotypes. Some people with trisomy 21 have mild to moderate intellectual disability, but many have a normal or near-normal intelligence. Some have heart defects, gastrointestinal problems, or other health issues, but many do not.\nTrisomy X, which is characterized by an extra copy of chromosome X, is the next mildest trisomy. It is caused by a 47,XXX karyotype. People with trisomy X often have mild intellectual disability and may have problems with fine motor skills, such as picking up small objects. They may also have heart defects, anxiety, or other health problems.\nTrisomy Y, which is characterized by an extra copy of chromosome Y, is the mildest trisomy for males.

We now know that this is not true.\nCells in the body can be different from each other in many ways. One way that cells can be different is by having different numbers of chromosomes.\nAll cells in the body have chromosomes. Chromosomes are made of DNA. You can think of DNA as a set of instructions for building and operating a cell.\nChromosomes come in pairs. Each pair of chromosomes is composed of one chromosome from each parent. The chromosomes in a pair are called alleles.\nCells that have the same number of chromosomes as a human are called diploid cells. Cells that have an odd number of chromosomes are called aneuploid cells.\nSOLUTION: Cells that are diploid have two alleles for each chromosome. All cells in the body are diploid except for germ cells. Germ cells are cells that go on to become eggs or sperm.\nChimaerism is the presence of two or more different cell lines in an individual. So, mosaicism and chimaerism are not the same as diploidy or aneuploidy.\nMosaicism is the presence of two or more different cell lines within the same organism. So, mosaicism is not the same as diploidy or aneuploidy.\nAneuploidy is the presence of one or more extra or missing alleles for a chromosome. So, aneuploidy is not the same as diploidy."}

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett organism's genotype may have one or more dominant alleles for a gene. In this case, the Punnett organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett organism's genotype may have only recessive alleles for a gene. In this case, the Punnett organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA organism's genotype does not affect its phenotype if its genotype has only alleles that are the same type as the organism's environment.\nAn organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene.

So, its phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nSOLUTION: Autozygosity mapping is used to map disorders that show which pattern of inheritance?\nAutozygosity mapping is a type of mapping. Mapping is used to find the location of a gene. Many types of inheritance can be mapped.\nX-linked inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a gene located on the X chromosome is involved. This type of inheritance follows X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive inheritance.\nAutosomal inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a gene is located on one of the first 22 human chromosomes. This type of inheritance follows autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance.\nAutosomal dominant inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a person needs to have only one dominant allele for a gene to get the gene's dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nAutosomal recessive inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a person needs to have at least two recessive alleles for a gene to get the gene's recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nX-linked dominant inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a gene located on the X chromosome is involved. This type of inheritance follows X-linked dominant inheritance. A person with X-linked dominant inheritance has one dominant allele for the gene and one recessive allele.\nX-linked recessive inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a gene located on the X chromosome is involved.

{"question": "Consanguinity shows a strong association with which pattern of inheritance?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Autosomal dominant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Autosomal recessive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "X-linked dominant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "X-linked recessive"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Consanguinity is a measure of how closely related two individuals are. The higher the consanguinity, the more closely related the individuals are. Consanguinity shows a strong association with autosomal dominant inheritance.\nAutosomal dominant inheritance requires only one copy of a gene to produce the dominant allele's trait. This means that consanguinity can cause autosomal dominant inheritance to occur. For example, if two parents have a dominant allele for a gene, each of their children has a 50% chance of inheriting that dominant allele. If the children inherit the dominant allele, they will express the dominant allele's trait.\nConsanguinity shows a strong association with X-linked dominant inheritance. X-linked dominant inheritance affects males and females differently. Males have one Y chromosome, which means that they cannot inherit an X-linked dominant allele on their X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, which means that they can inherit an X-linked dominant allele on one of their X chromosomes. If a male inherits an X-linked dominant allele on his X chromosome, he will express the dominant allele's trait.\nConsanguinity shows a strong association with autosomal recessive inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance requires both copies of a gene to be altered. This means that consanguinity can increase the chances that autosomal recessive inheritance will occur. For example, if two parents are both recessive for a gene, each of their children has a 25% chance of inheriting both copies of the recessive allele. If their children inherit both copies of the recessive allele, the children will express the recessive allele's trait.\nConsanguinity shows a strong association with X-linked recessive inheritance. X-linked recessive inheritance affects males and females differently. Males have one Y chromosome, which means that they cannot inherit an X-linked recessive allele on their X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, which means that they can inherit an X-linked recessive allele on one of their X chromosomes. If a female inherits an X-linked recessive allele on one of her X chromosomes, she will express the recessive allele's trait."}

This can be important for understanding the relative importance of nature and nurture in human development.\nTwins studies can also provide information about the locations of genes affecting a trait. If genes affecting a trait are found in regions of the genome that are more similar in identical twins than in fraternal twins, it suggests that these genes are more likely to be the cause of the trait's variation.\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the assumptions of genetic studies is that organisms are homogeneous, or at least as homogeneous as their environment allows. This assumption is more likely to be true for identical twins than for fraternal twins. This is because identical twins are genetically identical, while fraternal twins are not."}

Elevated enzyme activity in a carrier indicates that the carrier has one normal and one mutated copy of the affected gene. Carriers have one normal copy of the gene, which is able to produce a normal amount of the enzyme. The second copy of the gene is mutated, but it is still able to produce some enzyme.\nTay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that affects the brain and central nervous system. It is caused by a mutation in the HEXA gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called hexosaminidase A. This enzyme helps break down a substance called ganglioside. In people with Tay-Sachs disease, the mutated HEXA gene results in little or no functional hexosaminidase A enzyme. This causes ganglioside to build up in nerve cells in the brain, leading to the symptoms of the disease.\nAn enzyme assistant can be used to identify carriers of Tay-Sachs disease by measuring the activity of hexosaminidase A in a sample. If a sample has elevated levels of hexosaminidase A activity, it indicates that the person is a carrier of Tay-Sachs disease."}
