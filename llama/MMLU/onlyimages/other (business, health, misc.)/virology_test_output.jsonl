One part of the immune system is the adaptive immune system, which can learn to recognize and fight specific invaders.\nThe adaptive immune system is made up of immune cells called T cells and B cells. These cells can change and adapt over time. This adaptability is the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system.\nHere are some ways in which the adaptive immune system can change:\nMemory T cells can remember invaders they have encountered before. The next time the body is exposed to the same invader, memory T cells can quickly multiply and help fight the invader.\nClonal expansion is when a single T cell or B cell begins to multiply and become many cells. This can happen in response to an invader. The newly created cells can then help fight the invader.\nB cells can change into plasma cells. Plasma cells produce and secrete antibodies.\nAntibodies are proteins that can recognize and bind to specific invaders. They can also help to neutralize or destroy the invader.\nSOLUTION: The most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is its ability to change and adapt over time. This change can include clonal expansion, which is the reproduction of cells that have the ability to fight a specific invader."}

This process is how retroviruses can insert their genes into the DNA of a host organism.\nIn 1960, Howard Temin proposed that some viruses might have reverse transcriptase. This hypothesis was proved in 1970, when David Baltimore and his colleagues discovered reverse transcriptase. They found that some RNA viruses could make a DNA copy of their RNA.\nSOLUTION:A retrovirus was first discovered in chickens. In 1911, Peyton Rous noticed that a virus could cause tumors in chickens. This virus was later named Rous sarcoma virus.\nHoward Temin proposed that Rous sarcoma virus was a retrovirus in 1968. This was the first description of a retrovirus in humans.\nHTLV-1 was the first human retrovirus to be identified. In 1980, Dr. Robert Gallo and his colleagues discovered HTLV-1. They found that it could cause leukemia and other diseases.\nThis virus was first discovered in mice.

The virus spreads through contact with infected feces. Most people infected with the virus have no symptoms, but in some cases, polio can cause paralysis.\nThere is no cure for polio, but there is a highly effective vaccine. The vaccine is made of a weakened form of the virus. It is given to children to protect them from polio.\nSo far, the following have prevented polio from being eradicated:\nInability to vaccinate in some countries: Polio vaccination is difficult to do on a large scale in some areas. This is often because of war, poor infrastructure, or lack of funds.\nPoor quality (unsafe) vaccines: In the past, some polio vaccines were made using a virus that was not weakened enough. This could cause paralysis in some people.\nExpense: Eradication efforts are expensive. They require a lot of money to fund vaccination campaigns, laboratory testing, and other activities."}

{"question": "A case-control study is conducted to assess the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer patients with lung cancer and 100 controls are asked about their past alcohol consumption. According to the study results, alcohol consumption is strongly associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.5). The researchers then divide the study subjects into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Subsequent statistical analysis does not reveal any association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group. The scenario described is an example of which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Observer bias"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Confounding"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Placebo effect"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nonresponse bias"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Bias can affect the results of a study in various ways. One type of bias is called nonresponse bias. This type of bias occurs when the people who respond to a study are different from the people who do not respond. Nonresponse bias can affect the generalizability of the results.\nAnother type of bias is called observer bias. This type of bias occurs when the people who observe the study subjects are different from the people who collect the data. For example, if two observers observe the study subjects, and the observers are not trained to use the same measurement tools, the observers may measure the study subjects differently.\nConfounding is a type of bias that occurs when a factor that is being studied is associated with other factors that can affect the results. For example, if a study is looking at the effect of caffeine on blood pressure, but does not take into account the effect of drinking coffee, the study may conclude that caffeine causes high blood pressure. But in fact, the caffeine and coffee are associated with each other, and it is the coffee that is causing the high blood pressure.\nThe placebo effect is a type of bias that occurs when people in a study improve because they believe they are receiving a treatment, even if the treatment is not actually helping them. For example, if a study is looking at the effect of a new pain medication, some of the people in the study may get better because they believe they are receiving a strong pain medication.\nSOLUTION: In the scenario described, the researchers found that alcohol consumption is strongly associated with lung cancer. But subsequent statistical analysis did not reveal any association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group.\nThis means that when the study subjects were divided into two groups: smokers and non-smokers, there was no longer a strong association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer. This suggests that the strong association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer was due to confounding.\nThe fact that the researchers divided the study subjects into two groups based on smoking status introduced a confounding variable. This is because smoking status is strongly associated with lung cancer. So, when the researchers looked at the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within each group, they were no longer looking at the effect of alcohol consumption on lung cancer. Instead, they were looking at the effect of alcohol consumption on lung cancer within the context of smoking status."}

The virus is spread through the saliva of infected animals.\nIn order to be considered rabies-free, an area must have no indigenous wild animals with rabies. This means that there must be no cases of wild animals infected with rabies in the area for at least one year.\nIsland nations, UK, NZ and Australia are rabies-free. This area includes many countries with few cases of rabies. However, domestic animals still need to be vaccinated against rabies.\nThe United States is not rabies-free.

So, alternative methods must be used to study it.\nAnimal models can be used to study the human norovirus. The virus can be inoculated into animals, and then its growth and spread can be monitored. This can help to identify the source of the virus's symptoms and to test potential treatments.\nVolunteer studies can also be used to study the human norovirus. Volunteers can be given the virus and their responses can be monitored. This can include measuring the virus's spread in the body, measuring the symptoms that the virus causes, and testing potential treatments.\nIn cells using replicon systems, the human norovirus cannot be grown. But scientists can use replicon systems to study the virus's replication. A replicon is a small piece of RNA that can replicate on its own. By using a replicon that is similar to the human norovirus's RNA, scientists can study how the virus replicates.\nDeductions from the 3 human ORF's of the virus genome can also be used to study the human norovirus. The ORF's are the parts of the virus's RNA that contain the information needed to make its proteins. By using deductions based on the ORF's, scientists can learn more about the virus's proteins and how they contribute to the virus's ability to infect cells."}

So, each of these parts of a study can introduce systematic errors.\nA confounding error occurs when a factor that is not the exposure of interest affects the outcome. This can result in an incorrect estimate of the exposure's effect on the disease.\nA bias error occurs when systematic errors in the design, conduct, or analysis of a study produce a consistently incorrect estimate of the exposure's effect on the disease. For example, a study that only follows patients who have already developed a disease to determine if an exposure increased the risk of that disease will consistently overestimate the exposure's effect.\nAn interaction error occurs when two or more exposures interact to affect the disease. The effect of an exposure may be different depending on the level of another exposure. This can result in an incorrect estimate of an exposure's effect on the disease.\nA stratification error occurs when the study population is not divided into groups based on the exposure of interest.

They take advantage of recombination with the long RNA genome. The cycle begins with the attachment and penetration of the virus particle. The virus's RNA is then copied into an RNA complementary to the genome by the viral RdRp. The RdRp uses the genome as a template to copy the RNA. This process is called copying and transcribing. The RdRp also cleaves the RNA into shorter pieces, called replication intermediates. The replication intermediates are then used as a template for the RdRp to copy the RNA.

The most common way for a virus to kill a cell is by inducing apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This happens when a virus infects a cell and triggers certain genes in the host cell's DNA to produce proteins that cause the cell to die. This process is called apoptosis.\nThere are many ways a virus can trigger apoptosis. One way is by using proteins to attach to and enter the cell. This is called viral fusion. Another way is by using proteins to prevent the host cell from producing certain proteins that keep the cell from dying.\nOnce a virus has entered a cell, it may need to go to the cell's nucleus to activate genes that will produce proteins that help the virus reproduce. To do this, the virus may need to use certain signaling pathways that are found in the nucleus.\nOne way that viruses can block these signaling pathways is by using proteins to bind to and inactivate certain proteins in the nucleus. This can prevent the cell from producing proteins that are needed to keep the cell alive.\nAnother way that viruses can kill cells is by dissolving the cell's membrane. This is called lysis. This can happen when a virus uses proteins to bind to and break down the membrane.\nYet another way that viruses can kill cells is by fragmenting the cell's DNA. This can happen when a virus uses proteins to bind to and cut the DNA.\nFinally, a virus can kill a cell by totally blocking cellular transcription. This is called viral interference. This can happen when a virus uses proteins to bind to and block certain proteins that are needed for transcription."}

Which of the following types of bias is most likely present in this study?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Confounding"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nonresponse bias"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Recall bias"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Referral bias"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Bias can be introduced into a study in various ways. One way is through nonresponse bias, or bias that results because certain subjects do not participate in the study. Nonresponse bias can occur when some groups are more likely than others to not participate.\nFor example, imagine that a study is conducted to determine whether a new medication is effective at treating a disease. The study is designed to include only subjects with the disease, and the subjects are recruited from hospitals. Subjects who are aware of the study and wish to participate are more likely to be those who are sicker and more likely to be taking many medications, which could affect the results.\nAnother way bias can be introduced is through recall bias, or bias that results when subjects have difficulty remembering past events. Recall bias can occur when subjects are asked to recall events that happened a long time ago, or when they are asked to recall events from different periods of time.\nSOLUTION: The study described in the question is a case-control study, a type of study that compares a group of people with a specific condition to a group of people without the condition. In this study, the pathologists are aware of the race of the patients. This means that the pathologists are the ones who are doing the matching.\nMatching can introduce bias into a study. When different groups are formed based on specific criteria, the groups may not be fully comparable. For example, imagine that a study is conducted to determine whether a new medication is effective at treating a disease. The study is designed to include only subjects with the disease, and the subjects are recruited from hospitals. Subjects who are aware of the study and wish to participate are more likely to be those who are sicker and more likely to be taking many medications, which could affect the results.\nSo, the first group of pathologists may be reporting \u2018hypertensive nephropathy\u2019 more frequently for black patients because they are aware of the patients' race. This means that the race of the patient is a confounding factor. A confounding factor is a factor that affects the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable."}

{"question": "There is no vaccine against HIV because of which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The virus is so antigenically variable"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Such a vaccine would be too expensive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The virus can be controlled by a change in sexual habits"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Latency can abrogate any vaccine effect"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: A vaccine is a medicine that helps your body learn to fight a disease. A vaccine does this by introducing a small, dead piece of a virus to your body. This helps your body build up a defense against the virus.\nThere is no vaccine against HIV because of the following reasons:\nThe virus is so antigenically variable.\nAn antigen is a piece of a virus or bacteria that your body's immune system can recognize as foreign. An antigen that is highly variable is one that is constantly changing. HIV is highly antigenically variable. This means that HIV changes its surface proteins so much that your body cannot recognize it as a threat. This makes it hard to design a vaccine that would work against all types of HIV.\nSuch a vaccine would be too expensive.\nDeveloping a vaccine is a long and difficult process. It is also expensive. Many companies and organizations are working on an HIV vaccine. But it is not yet clear if they will be successful.\nThe virus can be controlled by a change in sexual habits.\nThe best way to prevent the spread of HIV is to avoid activities that expose you to the virus. This includes having sex without a condom and sharing needles.\nLatency can abrogate any vaccine effect.\nLatency is when the virus is in a dormant state. It is still in your body, but it is not causing damage. During latency, you are still infected with HIV. If a vaccine did not work during latency, it would not protect you from HIV."}

It is also called the \"stomach flu.\" Outbreaks of norovirus are common, especially in closed places like hospitals and nursing homes.\nSymptoms of norovirus include diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and fever. The virus is spread through contaminated food or water, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth.\nThere is no specific treatment for norovirus. Antibiotics will not work, because norovirus is a virus, not a bacterium. Symptoms usually go away on their own in 1-3 days. But in some cases, dehydration may occur. This can be dangerous, especially for young children and older adults.\nSOLUTION: Attention to handwashing and hygiene is the most important way to control the spread of norovirus. This can include washing your hands often with soap and water, especially after using the toilet or changing diapers, and avoiding touching your mouth, nose, or eyes with your hands.\nQuarantine is an extreme measure that is not usually necessary. It involves separating people who are infected from those who are not.\nNew antiviral drugs are not available for norovirus.\nA norovirus vaccine is not currently available."}
{"question": "Why do vigorous CD8 cell responses in chronically infected HIV-positive individuals fail to eliminate the virus?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "CTL exhaustion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Epitope escape"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Suboptimal CTL"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Absence of dendritic cells"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Chronically infected HIV-positive individuals do not eliminate the virus because vigorous CD8 cell responses fail to contain it. The only reason that these individuals do not die from HIV is that HIV does not kill its host directly. Instead, HIV causes chronic immune activation and inflammation, which can lead to many other health problems.\nOne reason why CD8 cell responses fail is because of CTL exhaustion. CTLs require a lot of energy to do their job. Over time, CTLs can become exhausted, which means that they are still present in the body, but they are no longer able to effectively fight the virus.\nAnother reason why CD8 cell responses fail is because of epitope escape. Epitopes are parts of the virus that are recognized by CD8 cells. Over time, HIV can change its epitopes, which means that the CD8 cells can no longer recognize and attack the virus.\nCTLs are specialized CD4 cells. CD4 cells, also called T cells, are a type of immune cell. They help the immune system fight infections."}
{"question": "The most widespread and important retrovirus is HIV-1; which of the following is true?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Infecting only gay people"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Infecting only males"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Infecting every country in the world"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Infecting only females"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: HIV-1 is a virus that infects cells of the immune system. It is most commonly spread through sexual contact or sharing of needles.\nAlthough HIV-1 does not infect everyone, it is widespread throughout the world. It is estimated that as of 2019, around 38 million people are living with HIV-1 worldwide.\nHIV-1 can infect both male and female cells. It is not limited to gay people, or to any other group.\nHIV-1 is a retrovirus. Like other retroviruses, it uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to make a DNA copy of its RNA genome. This DNA copy can insert into the genome of the host cell.\nWhen a cell is infected with HIV-1, the virus may use its reverse transcriptase enzyme to insert its DNA into the host cell's genome. This insertion can cause problems with the host cell's genetic instructions. Over time, this can lead to serious health problems."}

Most viral vaccines are produced by using either inactivated viruses or viral proteins (antigens) to stimulate the immune system.\nInactivated vaccines contain viruses that have been killed or inactivated with chemicals. When a person is vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine, the immune system produces antibodies in response to the viral antigens in the vaccine. These antibodies remain in the person's body, ready to neutralize the virus if the person is later exposed to it.\nViral protein vaccines contain only viral antigens. These vaccines do not contain live viruses, so they cannot cause the targeted virus to infect the person who is vaccinated. Instead, the viral antigens in the vaccine stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies.\nSOLUTION: Most viral vaccines are produced by using inactivated viruses or viral proteins (antigens) to stimulate the immune system.

One way is to use a sample of the population. Since the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance are all ways to estimate a population parameter, each of these quantities is a sample statistic.\nA sample statistic is a biased estimator. This means that the sample statistic is different from the population parameter it estimates. A sample statistic is also subject to random error. This means that different samples have different values.\nSOLUTION: Choose the sample statistic that is the least biased estimator of central tendency.\nThe median is the most reliable measure of central tendency for a positively skewed distribution. A positively skewed distribution has a long tail of high scores to the right. The median is unaffected by extreme scores.\nThe mode is the most common score in the distribution. A mode of 80 means that 80 was the most common score in the distribution. But the mode is a biased estimator of central tendency because it is affected by extreme scores.\nThe mean is the average score in the distribution. The mean is a biased estimator of central tendency because it is affected by extreme scores.

{"question": "Which of the following are goals of vaccination?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prevent infection"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Prevent disease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prevent transmission"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Goals of vaccination include preventing infection, preventing disease, and preventing transmission.\nA vaccine stimulates the immune system to prevent or ameliorate a disease. This can occur through several mechanisms. One is to directly attack the pathogen. Another is to provide immunological memory, so that the immune system can respond more quickly and effectively to a subsequent infection.\nVaccines can prevent infection with a disease, which is the first step in preventing the disease itself. Some vaccines are designed to do this. For example, the smallpox vaccine contains a weakened form of the virus. It can prevent the virus from entering a person\u2019s cells in the first place.\nVaccines can also prevent the disease itself. This is the main effect of most vaccines. For example, the measles vaccine can prevent measles.\nVaccines can also prevent transmission of a disease. This is happened through herd immunity. When a large percentage of a population is immune to a disease, that disease cannot spread effectively. This can happen when a significant percentage of a population is immune because they have been vaccinated."}

AIDS is acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\nAntiretroviral drugs are used to treat HIV. These drugs can block the replication of HIV. But HIV can become resistant to antiretroviral drugs.\nIn order to understand why a cure for HIV is unlikely, you need to know how HIV becomes a chronic infection. When HIV infects a cell, it becomes integrated into the cell's DNA. This means that the viral genes become a part of the cell's genome.\nThe integrated viral genes make viral proteins. These proteins can help the virus replicate. This is how HIV becomes a chronic infection.\nCurrent drugs can block the replication of HIV. But these drugs do not completely block viral replication. Some viral replication is still possible.\nCurrent drugs also do not penetrate to cells. This means that the drugs cannot reach the integrated viral DNA in all cells.\nEven if current drugs could completely block viral replication and penetrate to cells, they still could not cure HIV. This is because the integrated viral DNA is a part of the cell's genome. Cures for chronic infections do not remove the integrated viral DNA."}
