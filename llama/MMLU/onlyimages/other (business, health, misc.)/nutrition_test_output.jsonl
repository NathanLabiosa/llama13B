How a stem cell turns into a different type of cell is called differentiation.\nDuring differentiation, cells may turn into cells that make up muscles, organs, or other tissues. This process is called tissue-specific differentiation.\nEpigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence. One type of epigenetic change is an epigenetic modification.\nAn epigenetic modification can change the way a gene is expressed without changing the DNA sequence.\nSOLUTION: Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid. It is produced during fermentation of fiber by bacteria in the intestine. Butyrate has several effects in the intestine and in other cells. It can change the expression of genes. This can help turn on genes that promote cell growth and turn off genes that promote inflammation.\nCurcumin is a compound that is found in turmeric, a spice.

It is followed by another reaction in which the transamine is broken down to form a new amino acid and a molecule of carbon dioxide.\nOne of the roles of transaminases is to catalyze the reaction of transamination. These enzymes require a coenzyme to function.\nThere are two types of transaminases: one requires a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6 as a cofactor, and the other requires a coenzyme derived from vitamin B12.\nSOLUTION: Transamination is an irreversible reaction. This means that once an amino acid is transferred to a transamine, the amino acid cannot be recovered.\nOnly non-essential (dispensable) amino acids can be used for transamination. Essential amino acids cannot be converted to transamines.\nTransaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6. This is true."}

{"question": "Why might some biochemical (eg plasma or serum) indices of micronutrient status give misleading results in people with infections or inflammatory states?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because people who are sick often alter their diets, and may eat less food."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because the accuracy of some laboratory assays may be compromised in samples from people who are sick."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because some metabolic pathways are altered in sick people, which changes their micronutrient requirements."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because an acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Microorganisms can invade various sites in the human body, including the gut, lungs, and skin. Infections can also be spread throughout the body via the bloodstream. To fight these invaders, the body's immune system responds with an acute phase response. This response is characterized by the release of various proteins, including acute phase proteins (APPs). Many APPs are produced in the liver. They are then released into the bloodstream and can be detected by laboratory tests.\nThe concentration of APPs in the blood is a reflection of the body's response to an infection or inflammation. The concentration of APPs in the blood increases during the acute phase of an infection. So, laboratory tests that measure the concentration of APPs in the blood can give misleading results during an infection. This is because these tests do not distinguish between the concentration of APPs and the concentration of other metabolites, such as micronutrients.\nSome laboratory assays are imprecise during the acute phase of an infection. This is because many metabolites, including micronutrients, are changed during the acute phase response. As a result, some biochemical indices of micronutrient status may give misleading results during the acute phase of an infection.\nSOLUTION: An acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients. During the acute phase of an infection, the body tends to move micronutrients away from the gut and towards other tissues. This change in inter-tissue distribution can affect the accuracy of tests that measure micronutrient levels in plasma or serum. So, the correct answer is D."}

One way that antioxidants can remove free radicals is by converting them to other chemicals that are not free radicals.\nOne of the ways that antioxidants can convert free radicals to other chemicals is by donating a chemical group to the free radical. This donation can turn the free radical into a stable molecule that does not damage cells.\nSome antioxidants, by virtue of their chemical makeup, can easily donate a chemical group to a free radical. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant.\nVitamin E is a lipophilic (fat-loving) antioxidant. This means it can easily move through the fatty membranes of cells to get to cellular structures like membranes and mitochondria.\nOnce inside a cell, vitamin E can protect unsaturated fatty acids from oxidation. Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids can produce free radicals.\nIf vitamin E donates a chemical group to a free radical, the free radical becomes a stable molecule that does not damage cells. Vitamin E can then be reduced by other antioxidants, such as glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, to become active again."}

{"question": "Which of the following vitamins is required for fatty acid b-oxidation?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Niacin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Riboflavin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thiamin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vitamin C"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Fatty acid b-oxidation is a process that produces energy in the form of ATP. This process occurs in the mitochondria of cells.\nDuring b-oxidation, a fatty acid is extracted from the cell membrane and cleaved into acetyl-CoA units. The acetyl-CoA units are then transported into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.\nThe oxidation of acetyl-CoA units is fueled by electron bonds. Vitamin B-3, also known as niacin, is a required coenzyme for the oxidation of acetyl-CoA. Niacin is not an electron carrier, but it is needed to keep the electron transfer chain in the mitochondria functioning properly.\nNiacin is a B-vitamin. B-vitamins are a group of vitamins that have similar structures. They are water-soluble, which means that they can travel freely in the body.\nThiamin, or vitamin B1, is also a required coenzyme for b-oxidation. Thiamin is an electron carrier. It carries electrons to the next coenzyme in the electron transfer chain.\nRiboflavin, or vitamin B2, is also a required coenzyme for b-oxidation. Riboflavin is not an electron carrier. It is needed for the formation of the active form of another coenzyme.\nVitamin C is not a required vitamin for fatty acid b-oxidation."}

It may be caused by a number of different factors, including surgical removal of a portion of the intestine, disease of the intestine, or radiation therapy to the abdomen.\nA. Intestinal failure always requires parenteral nutritional support. Parenteral nutrition is the delivery of nutrients directly into a vein. It is a treatment for intestinal failure.\nB. A colectomy is the surgical removal of part or all of the colon. A colectomy may be necessary for the treatment of intestinal failure. However, a colectomy may not always lead to intestinal failure.\nC. Intestinal failure is always permanent. Intestinal failure is a serious condition that can be life-threatening. However, in some cases, it may be possible to treat the underlying condition that is causing the intestinal failure. This may lead to a reversal of the intestinal failure.\nD. Sodium supplementation of >=90 mmol/l may benefit a patient with intestinal failure. Sodium is an electrolyte. Electrolytes are substances that help to conduct electricity in the body. Sodium is important for maintaining the right balance of fluids in the body. Intestinal failure may affect the body's ability to absorb sodium. Supplemental sodium may help to replace sodium that is not being absorbed."}

The baby needs calcium to build its bones, and the mother's body uses calcium from her bones to help build the baby's bones. This can affect the mother's bone mineral content.\nThe rate of dietary calcium absorption does not affect bone mineral content.\nCalcium requirements do not decrease during pregnancy and lactation. In fact, pregnancy and lactation increase the need for calcium.\nBone mineral loss from the skeleton can occur when the body needs more calcium than it is getting. This can happen during pregnancy and lactation."}
{"question": "Observational epidemiology studies have produced useful in identifying health effects of many food contaminants, but not for assessing risk, because:\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is never possible to know whether observed effects are caused by the contaminant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Human exposure though food is usually much less than exposures that have been studied"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Controlled animal studies provide more reliable information"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reliable dose-response data are difficult to acquire and often unavailable"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Observational epidemiology studies are valuable for identifying health effects of many food contaminants, but they are not well-suited for assessing risk. This is because a number of factors can affect the relationship between food contaminant exposure and health outcome, including individual differences in nutrition, lifestyle, and susceptibility.\nControlled animal studies can provide information on the health effects of food contaminants, but studies in animals do not always produce results that are applicable to humans. In addition, animal studies do not allow researchers to examine the effects of food contaminants in the context of typical human exposures.\nReliable dose-response data are difficult to acquire and are often unavailable. Dose-response data describe the relationship between exposure to a substance and the frequency of health effects. Scientists can use dose-response data to estimate the increased risk of disease that is associated with a particular level of exposure to a substance. However, dose-response data are often difficult to acquire because it is ethically unsound to expose people to toxic substances to determine how they affect people.\nHuman exposure through food is usually much less than exposures that have been studied in controlled animal studies. In addition, humans and animals metabolize substances differently, so the effects of a food contaminant in humans may be different from its effects in animals.\nIt is never possible to know whether observed effects are caused by the contaminant. Many factors other than exposure to a food contaminant can affect health. So, even if exposure to a food contaminant is associated with a health effect, it is usually not possible to attribute the effect to the contaminant with certainty."}

The treatment of Bulimia Nervosa should target exclusively on purging practices.\nThe first approach is to discuss body image. A main issue in bulimia is the patient's body image. This can include issues such as the patient's desire to be thin, their self-esteem, and their perception of their own body shape. Psychoanalytic approaches to treatment may include some discussion of body image.\nIt is not useful to discuss weight with patients. Patients with bulimia often have a distorted body image. They may believe that they are overweight when they are not. Discussing weight with a patient may reinforce this distorted body image.\nFluoxetine is considered of benefit. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs can be effective in treating bulimia.\nTreatments should target exclusively on purging practices. Purging practices are a hallmark of bulimia. They can be harmful to the patient. Exclusively targeting treatments on purging practices may be more effective in reducing or stopping these harmful behaviors."}

RQ values greater than 1.0 indicate that carbohydrates are being burned as fuel. RQ values less than 1.0 indicate that fats are being burned as fuel.\nThe digestive system breaks down exogenous carbohydrates into endogenous carbohydrates (such as glycogen) and fat. When exogenous carbohydrates are converted to endogenous carbohydrates, the RQ goes beyond a value of 1.0.\nA high carbohydrate diet decreases RQ. This means that more carbohydrates are being burned as fuel, and less fat is being burned as fuel.\nFasting increases RQ. This means that more fat is being burned as fuel, and less carbohydrate is being burned as fuel.\nThe RQ increases with fasting. This means that more fat is being burned as fuel."}

A person's DNA methylation patterns can be affected in utero by environmental factors, such as nutrition.\nThe Dutch Hunger Winter was a period of famine in the Netherlands during World War II. A study found that people who were in utero during this period had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. The study also measured DNA methylation in blood cells from the study participants. The researchers looked at how in utero exposure to the Dutch Hunger Winter during different stages of pregnancy affected DNA methylation in blood cells.\nThe study found that in utero exposure to the Dutch Hunger Winter during the third trimester of pregnancy had the biggest effects on DNA methylation in blood cells from the adult offspring. This was the stage of pregnancy when the fetus was most developed."}

This can help older adults achieve optimal nutritional status by providing the nutrients they need to maintain health without excess calories.\nA high energy content diet means consuming a diet that is high in calories. This can help older adults gain weight, but it may not provide the nutrients they need to maintain health.\nA low energy content diet means consuming a diet that is low in calories. This may help older adults lose weight, but it may not provide the nutrients they need to maintain health.\nA daily antioxidant supplement may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, but it is not a substitute for a healthy diet."}

For example, an increase in the concentration of certain cytokines in the blood can indicate the presence of inflammation, which can be an indicator of low vitamin C levels.\nBiochemical status indices can also be used to estimate the overall quality of a person's diet. For example, a low level of vitamin C in the blood may indicate that a person is not getting enough vitamin C in their diet.\nHowever, a biochemical status index is not a direct measure of a nutrient's effect on health. It is not possible to determine the presence or risk of a clinical deficiency or excess from a biochemical status index alone.\nA biochemical status index may be used to estimate the overall health and freedom from disease. For example, high levels of certain cytokines in the blood have been associated with a higher risk of certain diseases. But whether a person has a disease or not is not dependent on how nutritious their diet is.\nSOLUTION: A biochemical status index can be used to estimate the tissue levels, or body status, of a nutrient.\nThe question tells you that vitamin C is a micronutrient. Micronutrients are nutrients that the body needs in small quantities.\nA biochemical status index can be used to estimate the tissue levels of a micronutrient.

The antrum, or the pyloric end of the stomach, grinds the proteins into smaller pieces. The products of this digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides.\nGastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum.\nThe antrum of the stomach is the part of the stomach that does the grinding. So, the products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides.\nGastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion.\nGastric zymogenic cells produce the enzymes chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A. These enzymes initiate the process of protein digestion.\nThe products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters, the correct answer is A.\nThe brush border is the part of the small intestine that absorbs most of the amino acids. It has a large number of transporters for different types of amino acids. So, the products of protein digestion are absorbed as free amino acids."}

The choice of food commodities affects food systems, food security, and nutrition.\nFood commodities can be categorized in different ways. One way is to look at the type of food.\nThis type of food commodity includes beans, lentils, peas, and potatoes. It also includes some grains, such as corn and wheat.\nFruits and vegetables are another type of food commodity. These foods are rich in vitamins and minerals, and they are an important part of a healthy diet.\nSOLUTION: Rising incomes and urbanization are trends that are seen on a global scale. They are strong predictors of changing food choices.\nAs incomes rise, people tend to eat more foods that are higher in protein, such as meat and dairy products. They also tend to eat more foods that are easier to transport and store, such as beans and lentils.\nUrbanization also affects food choices. In cities, people may have less space to grow their own food. So, they tend to eat more fruits and vegetables, which are easy to transport and store.\nRoots and tubers are starchy foods. They are a good source of energy, but they are not rich in protein. So, they are not a typical part of a meat- or dairy-based diet."}

During this time, the isotope mixes into the person's tissues.\nAfter the circulation period, the person's tissues are removed and measured to determine the relative amounts of tissue types. The method is based on the principle that the more often a tissue is replaced, the more of the isotope will be in that tissue.\nAnother body composition method is skinfold thickness. This method involves measuring the thickness of the body at several points with a caliper. The thicker the skinfold at each point, the more fat is at that point."}
{"question": "These factors increase risk of osteoporotic fracture:\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "High bone mineral density"}, {"label": "B", "text": "High body weight"}, {"label": "C", "text": "High lean mass"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Poor muscle strength"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Osteoporosis is a disease that leads to bone fragility and increases the risk of fractures. A number of factors can increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Some of these factors include high bone mineral density, high body weight, high lean mass, and poor muscle strength.\nA high bone mineral density can increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures. This is because bones can become hard and dense as a result of having a high bone mineral density. However, in some cases, a high bone mineral density can also indicate that bones are becoming more fragile.\nA high body weight can increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures. This is because the greater your body weight, the more stress is placed on your bones.\nHigh lean mass can increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Lean mass is made up of muscle, bone, and other tissues. As people age, they tend to lose lean mass. Losing lean mass can increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures.\nPoor muscle strength can increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Muscle strength is linked to bone strength. Weak muscles can contribute to weak bones."}

The daily value for nutrients is found on food labels.\nA nutrient's daily value is equal to the recommended daily intake (RDI) for that nutrient. The RDI is determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThe RDI is based on the average intake of the nutrient by a group of people. It is not meant to be a target for individual intakes. Instead, daily values are intended to help people eat a balanced diet.\nA nutrient's upper level, or UL, is the highest level of the nutrient that is considered safe. ULs are used to help identify health risks.\nAn upper level is not a target for how much a person should eat. Instead, an upper level is meant to be a guide. It tells you how much of the nutrient you should eat in a day.\nIf you eat more than an upper level, there is an increased risk of negative health effects. But, whether or not negative effects occur also depends on the individual's unique circumstances.\nFor example, eat too much calcium, and you might increase your risk of developing kidney stones. But how many people are at risk in this way?\nThat is, how many people have to eat at or above the UL before one or more people are at an increased risk of developing kidney stones?\nIn some cases, the answer is clear. If you eat at or above an upper level, you are at an increased risk of negative health effects.\nIn other cases, the answer is not so clear. For example, eating at or above an upper level of sugar may increase your risk of heart disease. But how many people are at risk?\nThat is, how many people have to eat at or above the UL before one or more people are at an increased risk of heart disease?\nSOLUTION: Nutrients may pose health risks when intakes exceed established ULs.\nOther conditions for nutrients to pose health risks include:\neating less than the RDI, and\neating at or above an upper level.\nSo, nutrients may pose health risks when intakes are less than those required for nutritional benefits and at any level greater than a recommended dietary intake."}

Produce hormones and other signaling molecules.\n6. Assistant: LECTURE: The microbiota is a complex community of microorganisms that reside on and within the body.\nSome microbiota are beneficial to the host, while others are not. The microbiota that live in and on the body are collectively known as the body's microbiota.\nThe microbiota can break down certain drugs.\nSome drugs are metabolized, or broken down, by the liver. But many drugs are not metabolized by the liver. Instead, these drugs are metabolized by microorganisms that live in the gut.\nThe microbiota can also change the way that the body absorbs certain drugs.\nAfter a drug is absorbed, the body can use it as intended. But the microbiota can change the way that the body absorbs certain drugs. This can affect the way the drug works in the body.\nThe microbiota can also affect the way that the body eliminates certain drugs.\nAll drugs must be eliminated from the body.

{"question": "Which of the following statements about glucose metabolism is correct?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glucagon increases the rate of glycolysis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Glycolysis requires NADP+"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In cellular respiration, glucose is completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water. But in order to enter cellular respiration, glucose must first be metabolized. This metabolism, or breakdown, of glucose is called glycolysis.\nGlycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. It involves the cleavage of glucose into two three-carbon sugars, which are then used to produce cellular energy.\nOne of the products of glycolysis is a compound called pyruvate. Pyruvate can be used in a process called pyruvate oxidation to produce cellular energy.\nIn order to enter pyruvate oxidation, pyruvate must be converted into a compound called acetyl-CoA. This conversion occurs in the mitochondria and involves the addition of a specific molecule to pyruvate.\nThe conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is facilitated by a compound called ATP.\nOnce inside the mitochondria, acetyl-CoA can be used to produce cellular energy.\nThe process of producing cellular energy from acetyl-CoA is called the Krebs cycle, or citric acid cycle. It occurs in the mitochondria and involves the production of a large number of intermediate compounds.\nFinally, the end products of the Krebs cycle are molecules called ATP. These ATP molecules can be used to do work in the cell.\nSOLUTION: Glycolysis is the metabolism of glucose. Like all metabolisms, glycolysis can increase the rate of a subsequent process. That subsequent process is the breakdown of glucose in the Krebs cycle.\nSo, glycolysis can increase the rate of glucose metabolism.\nGlycolysis requires NADP+. NADP+ is a coenzyme. Coenzymes are molecules that can be used to carry chemical groups from one enzyme to another.\nIn glycolysis, NADP+ is used to accept a chemical group from the intermediate compounds in glycolysis. This helps to break down glucose.\nThe breakdown of glucose in glycolysis produces two three-carbon sugars.\nThe end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate. Red blood cells do not produce ATP. Instead, they use pyruvate to enter the Krebs cycle."}

In order to calculate this, you need to know the concentration of the protein and the concentration of plasma.\nThe plasma concentration of a protein can be useful for detecting changes in vitamin D deficiency. For example, if vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the plasma concentration of prothrombin, then a vitamin D supplement might increase the plasma concentration of prothrombin, which could be an indicator that vitamin D deficiency is decreasing.\nSOLUTION: Alkaline phosphatase is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphate esters, and acid phosphatase is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphate anhydrides. Both of these activities are important for bone health. So, if vitamin D deficiency increases the plasma activity of alkaline phosphatase or acid phosphatase, it could be an indicator that vitamin D deficiency is affecting bone health.\nThe plasma concentration of prothrombin and the plasma concentration of preprothrombin are not directly affected by vitamin D. So, increasing vitamin D deficiency is not likely to increase the plasma concentration of prothrombin or the plasma concentration of preprothrombin."}

Faecal digestibility measures the amount of a food that is absorbed and excreted as faeces. Faecal digestibility can indicate how well a food is digested in the intestines.\nHowever, faecal digestibility does not directly measure the amount of a food that is absorbed into the blood. To measure absorption, researchers can use a marker that is absorbed in a way that can be measured in the blood. One such marker is labeled leucine.\nLeCTURE: The ileum is the last part of the small intestine. Food antigens that are not absorbed in the small intestine are found in the leCTURE: An antigen is a substance that can cause an immune response. Food antigens are substances in food that can cause an immune response.\nEvery food has antigens. The immune system can mount a response to these antigens. This is called a food reaction. Food reactions can include hay fever-type symptoms, eczema, and food-induced anaphylaxis.\nSOLUTION: The ileum is the last part of the small intestine. Food antigens that are not absorbed in the small intestine are found in the faeces. So, to measure how well a food is absorbed in the small intestine, researchers can use a marker that is absorbed in the small intestine and measured in the blood. They can use labeled leucine to do this.\nLeucine is an amino acid. It is absorbed in the small intestine and its absorption can be measured in the blood.\nResearchers can use leucine marked with a radioactive isotope. They can then measure the isotope in the blood to see how much labeled leucine was absorbed."}

Fat-free mass includes all the tissues in your body except fat. So, if you gain weight and some of the weight is from fat-free mass, your BMR will increase.\nYour BMR is lower when you have less fat-free mass in your body. This means that if you lose weight and some of the weight is from fat-free mass, your BMR will decrease.\nThe amount of fat-free mass you have is not affected by your thyroid hormone levels. So, your BMR is not altered by hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.\nHypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can affect your metabolic rate. But these conditions affect the amount of energy your body uses, not the BMR.\nThe BMR is measured in a comfortable sitting position."}

Chylomicrons transport dietary fats and cholesterol from the small intestine to the blood.\nVLDL is made by the liver and is secreted into the blood. VLDL contains more triglycerides than chylomicrons. As VLDL moves through the blood, it delivers triglycerides to cells that need them. As VLDL triglycerides are removed, the remnants are converted to IDL.\nIDL is a smaller lipoprotein that contains mostly triglycerides. It is made by the liver and is secreted into the blood.\nLDL is the \"bad\" cholesterol. It is made by the liver and is secreted into the blood. LDL transports cholesterol to the tissues.\nHDL is the \"good\" cholesterol. It is made in the liver and is secreted into the blood. HDL transports cholesterol from the tissues to the liver, where it can be removed from the body.\nSOLUTION: Cholesterol and fatty acids absorbed from the intestinal lumen are packaged into chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are secreted from the enterocytes into the lymph."}

This can happen because the liver is resistant to the effects of insulin, which normally tells the liver to stop producing glucose.\nThe muscles of people with type 2 diabetes are often resistant to insulin, which makes it difficult for them to use glucose. As a result, the muscles don't take up as much glucose as they normally would.\nThe pancreas is responsible for producing insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas often doesn't produce enough insulin to keep up with the body's demands."}

They are caused by mutations in genes that control the development of the immune system.\nBecause SCID affects the immune system, people with SCID are susceptible to recurrent severe infections. These infections can be with almost any type of organism, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.\nSome of the infections that can occur in SCID are pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, and skin infections. These infections can be severe, and they can also be difficult to treat.\nMany of the signs of SCID are also signs of other diseases. So, other conditions should be ruled out before concluding that a person has SCID.\nFamily history is not a good clue for SCID. SCID is usually not inherited.\nGeneralized spread of a bacterial strain after vaccination is not a good sign. Vaccines are given to prevent infections.\nA family history of unexplained death in infancy is not a good sign. This history suggests that some of an infant's siblings or cousins may have had a condition that could have been caused by a SCID. But this history does not, by itself, indicate that the infant has SCID."}

Following a meal, the levels of triacylglycerols in the blood increase, and the levels of glycerol and free fatty acids (FFAs) decrease. The decrease in FFAs leads to a decrease in plasma NEFA concentrations. This decrease is due to the increase in triacylglycerol concentrations and the increase in the size of chylomicrons, which are the lipoproteins that transport triacylglycerols from the intestine to the liver.\nConsumption of a meal leads to suppression of lipase activity within adipose tissue leading to a decrease in plasma NEFA concentrations.\nAdipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin and therefore is most active following meal consumption.\nDuring the postprandial period the VLDL synthesis pathway is suppressed in favour of hydrolysis of chylomicrons."}

It can also affect the ways in which food is produced and distributed. But whether these effects will reduce or increase hunger and malnutrition depends on how they affect the availability, affordability, and consumption of food.\nThe choice of whether these effects will be positive or negative will depend on how they affect the availability, affordability, and consumption of food.\nMost poor people live in rural areas. So, any effect of urbanisation that affects mainly urban residents is unlikely to have a significant effect on hunger and malnutrition.\nPoor people in cities and towns have greater difficulty purchasing food. So, they may be more vulnerable to food price increases. This could increase the number of hungry people.\nLow-income people in cities and towns may have limited opportunities to grow their own food. So, they may consume a greater quantity of foods that are imported. This could increase their exposure to price increases in food imports. This could increase the number of hungry people.\nUrbanisation can increase the productivity of agriculture. This could increase the availability of food and decrease the number of hungry people."}

However, as the following table and calculation show, a cheeseburger is not the most cost-effective food in terms of price per calorie.\n | Food | Price | Calories |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cheese burger | $5.00 | 300 |\n| Apple | $1.00 | 95 |\n| Broccoli | $2.00 | 55 |\n| SOLUTION: To calculate the price per calorie for each food, follow the formula stated above.\nPrice per calorie = Price / Calories\nFor the cheeseburger, the price is $5.00, and the calories are 300. So, the price per calorie for the cheeseburger is $5.00 / 300 = $0.167 / calorie.\nFor the apple, the price is $1.00, and the calories are 95. So, the price per calorie for the apple is $1.00 / 95 = $0.105 / calorie.\nFor the broccoli, the price is $2.00, and the calories are 55. So, the price per calorie for the broccoli is $2.00 / 55 = $0.364 / calorie.\nAs a reference, the average price per calorie for all foods in the US is about $0.25 per calorie.\nSo, in terms of price per calorie, broccoli is the cheapest and most nutritious food."}

These proteins are found in the apical membranes of the enterocytes. When they are stimulated by a hormone, they flip-flop from the basolateral to the apical membrane. This flip-flop mechanism directly transports water from the lumen to the bloodstream.\nWater flow from the bloodstream to the lumen can be associated with the secretion of water by the pancreas. As discussed earlier, the pancreas secretes water and sodium ions into the small intestine. This increase in water in the lumen can then be reabsorbed by the enterocytes.\nWater absorption by the enterocytes occurs through two primary mechanisms: co-transport and osmosis. Co-transport moves water and other solutes across the enterocyte membrane from the lumen to the bloodstream. Osmosis moves water from the lumen to the enterocyte.\nSOLUTION: A flip-flop mechanism efficiently transports water directly across the enterocyte membrane. This is a correct statement.\nThe statement that dietary intake of water is always greater than water movement in the small intestine is incorrect. This statement is incorrect.\nThe flip-flop mechanism is one way that water can move from the lumen to the bloodstream. So, dietary intake of water is not always greater than water movement in the small intestine."}

Mild allergies may cause a runny nose, sneezing, and itching. More serious allergies can cause severe reactions, including trouble breathing, a rapid heartbeat, and even unconsciousness.\nAllergies are usually not serious. But in some people, they can lead to a potentially life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis.\nAn allergy is not a food intolerance. Unlike allergies, food intolerances are not caused by an immune system response.\nFood intolerances can cause a range of symptoms. But they do not involve the immune system. So, food intolerances are usually not severe.\nAn allergy is not uncomfortable. An allergy can cause mild to severe symptoms. So, allergies are not uncomfortable but of little medical concern.\nFood allergies can be avoided by not eating the allergen. If you are allergic to a food, you can avoid an allergic reaction by not eating that food.\nBut it is usually not possible to completely avoid an allergen. Even small amounts of an allergen can cause a reaction. So, it is important to be careful about what you eat."}

{"question": "Which statement about intestinal \"brakes\" and \"accelerators\" is FALSE?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Short-chain fatty acids which move from colon to caecum (reflux) promote ileo-caecal motility"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the \"fasting\" to the \"feeding\" pattern."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Intestinal motility is the term used to describe the synchronized rhythmic contractions of the intestines. The strength of these contractions is called motility. The coordination and pattern of contractions are called motility patterns.\nThe movements of the small intestine are critical to nutrient absorption. These movements are called small intestinal motility. The movements of the large intestine are critical to the formation and passage of feces. These movements are called large intestinal motility.\nThe speed of the movements is called the motility wave. The number of motility waves per minute is called the motility pattern frequency.\nThe following statements describe the ways in which nutrients can affect intestinal motility.\nDietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas.\nInsulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. It has some effects on intestinal motility, but dietary starch is not a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because of its effect on insulin release.\nGastrin is a hormone that stimulates the production of stomach acid. It also stimulates the release of motilin.\nMotilin is a hormone that stimulates the movements of the small intestine.\nShort-chain fatty acids which move from colon to caecum (reflux) promote ileo-caecal motility.\nThe arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the \"fasting\" to the \"feeding\" pattern.\nWhen liver cells break down fats, they produce molecules called bile acids. Bile acids travel to the small intestine and help absorb fats. They also stimulate the release of pancreatic lipase. Pancreatic lipase helps break down fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. The arrival of lipid in the duodenum does not cause an immediate reduction in motility."}

The conclusion of an argument may be true, even if the argument's premises are not.\nWhen evaluating an argument, it is important to consider the evidence that is presented. Evidence can include examples, statistics, and expert opinions.\nExamples can be powerful pieces of evidence. They can provide strong support for an argument. However, examples can also be misleading. They may not represent average cases.\nStatistics can also be powerful forms of evidence. When presented in a graph, statistics can show trends and patterns. However, it is important to consider the sample size. The larger the sample size, the more likely the statistics are to accurately represent the population.\nExpert opinions can be powerful forms of evidence. Experts have special knowledge and experience. Their opinions may be very persuasive. However, it is important to consider the credentials of the experts. The more respected the experts, the more persuasive their opinions are likely to be.\nIt is important to consider the quality of the evidence. The best evidence is strong, relevant, and up-to-date.\nSOLUTION: Lack of docosahexaenoic acid in vegans causes visual and cognitive impairment. This conclusion is not true.\nThe evidence presented does not support the conclusion. The evidence shows that lack of docosahexaenoic acid is associated with visual and cognitive impairment, but it does not establish that one causes the other.\nIt is possible that visual and cognitive impairment cause a vegan to have a diet that is low in docosahexaenoic acid. It is also possible that some other factor is responsible for both the visual and cognitive impairment and the low docosahexaenoic acid levels.\nThe other statements are true. Docosahexaenoic acid is absent from vegan diets. Docosahexaenoic acid can be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid in non-vegetarians, but not in vegans. Microalgae can be used to synthesize docosahexaenoic acid."}

{"question": "What caused the food-price spike of 2007-2008?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development caused the spike."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The use of food crops to produce biofuel caused food prices to rise."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It was caused by commodity price speculation."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above were among the causes."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: A food-price spike has many causes. These causes include long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development, the use of food crops to produce biofuel, and commodity price speculation.\nGlobal demand for food has been increasing. At the same time, agricultural productivity has been going down. Some farmers have been using their land to grow biofuel crops instead of food crops.\nBiofuel crops are grown to be used as fuel. For example, crops such as corn can be used to produce ethanol, which can be used as a gasoline additive. In 2007-2008, high gasoline prices made biofuel production from crops like corn very profitable. So, more land was used to grow crops for biofuel. This pushed up the price of food crops.\nThe first step in answering the question is to figure out what was caused. Caused is a synonym for the word because. So, you need to figure out what was the cause.\nCommodity price speculation is when people buy and sell commodities in hopes of making a profit. This speculation can cause the price of a commodity to rise. Many people speculate that commodity price speculation caused the food-price spike of 2007-2008.\nLong-term neglect of agricultural and rural development refers to the fact that governments in many developing countries have not been investing enough in agriculture and rural development. This neglect has contributed to the food-price spike.\nThe use of food crops to produce biofuel is a direct cause of the food-price spike. Food crops are used to produce biofuel. So, when more land is used to grow crops for biofuel, the price of food crops will rise."}

These measures can be used to assess the potential causal effect of an exposure on an outcome.\nMany factors can affect the strength of the association between an exposure and an outcome. One of the most important is the degree to which the exposure and the outcome are correlated. This degree of correlation is often described in terms of measures of association, such as the relative risk.\nOther factors can also affect the strength of the association between an exposure and an outcome. For example, the strength of the causal mechanisms underlying the association, the reversibility of the exposure, and the presence of confounding factors can also affect the strength of the association.\nHowever, measures of effect do not directly assess the strength of the causal mechanisms, the reversibility of the exposure, or the presence of confounding factors. These factors can affect the strength of the association, but they do so by affecting the strength of the mechanisms that link the exposure to the outcome.\nTherefore, epidemiological measures of effect assess the strength of the association between an exposure and an outcome.\nSOLUTION: An association is a relationship between two variables. Association does not imply causation. So, an epidemiological measure of effect assists in quantifying the strength of the association between an exposure and an outcome.\nThe word \"association\" in the question refers to the correlation between the exposure and the outcome. This correlation can be measured using various statistical measures, such as the relative risk.\nThe relative risk is a measure of the strength of the association. It can be used to assess the potential causal effect of an exposure on an outcome.\nA relative risk of 1 means that the exposure is not associated with the outcome. This means that the outcome is not more likely to occur in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group.\nA relative risk greater than 1 indicates that the exposure is associated with the outcome. This means that the outcome is more likely to occur in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group.\nA relative risk less than 1 indicates that the exposure is associated with the outcome. This means that the outcome is less likely to occur in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group."}

For example, people who eat more fruits and vegetables also tend to have higher incomes, which could be related to better health outcomes. So, it is difficult to separate the effect of eating more fruits and vegetables from the effect of having a higher income.\nTo adjust for confounding, researchers can use statistical techniques to remove the effects of other variables that are associated with the nutrient or food component of interest. These techniques can include stratified analysis, multivariate regression, and matched pairs analysis."}

Each of the essential amino acids must be present in the diet for the body to make protein.\nSome plant protein sources are deficient in one or more of the essential amino acids. For example, rice is deficient in lysine, and wheat is deficient in methionine.\nOther plant protein sources are deficient in several essential amino acids. For example, flax is deficient in lysine, methionine, and tryptophan.\nHowever, it is not necessary to get all essential amino acids from every meal. As long as you get all of the essential amino acids over the course of a day, your body can make protein.\nSOLUTION: Plant protein sources can contain all of the essential amino acids, although some may be limited by the amount of particular amino acids. Soy is a complete protein, which means that it has all of the essential amino acids in sufficient amounts.\nOther plant protein sources are not complete proteins, but can be combined with other foods to make a complete protein.

For example, your body will increase its thermogenesis in response to being cold. This increase in thermogenesis is called non-shivering thermogenesis.\nWhen you are exposed to cold, your body will first use shivering thermogenesis to increase its temperature. But if you are cold for a long time, your body will start to use non-shivering thermogenesis, which includes an increase in basal metabolic rate (your body's rate of burning fuel when you are at rest).\nA decrease in non-shivering thermogenesis when exposed to cold is one example of adaptive thermogenesis. This decrease happens in response to cold exposure. The decrease in non-shivering thermogenesis is one way that the body conserves fuel when it is cold.\nAn increase in basal metabolic rate that is not fully explained by a change in body composition during chronic overfeeding is not an example of adaptive thermogenesis. Basal metabolic rate is the rate at which your body burns fuel when you are at rest. An increase in basal metabolic rate that is not fully explained by a change in body composition could be due to an increase in muscle mass. This increase would not be a response to cold or to any other stimulus. So, it would not be an example of adaptive thermogenesis.\nA decrease in spontaneous physical activity during chronic overfeeding is not an example of adaptive thermogenesis. As mentioned above, adaptive thermogenesis refers to the body's response to changes in circumstances. A decrease in spontaneous physical activity during chronic overfeeding is not a response to any change in circumstances. So, it would not be an example of adaptive thermogenesis.\nA decrease in heat loss when exposed to cold is an example of adaptive thermogenesis. When you are cold, your body will increase its thermogenesis in order to produce heat. A decrease in heat loss is one way that the body can conserve fuel when it is cold."}

The human body needs nutrients to stay healthy.\nA deficiency is a shortage of a nutrient. Deficiencies of nutrients can lead to negative health effects. For example, a deficiency of vitamin C can lead to scurvy. A deficiency of iron can lead to anaemia.\nAnaemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues.\nSOLUTION: Anaemia can be caused by a deficiency of iron. Iron is a mineral. It is not made by the body. So, iron needs to be obtained from food.\nZinc is an essential trace element. It is a nutrient that the body needs in small amounts. A deficiency of zinc can lead to anaemia.\nVitamin D helps the body absorb iron. So, a deficiency of vitamin D can cause anaemia.\nIodine and vitamin C do not cause anaemia. Copper and iron are not essential nutrients. Getting too much copper or iron can be harmful."}

This condition is known as leptin deficiency.\nThe lack of leptin will result in overeating and obesity. The lack of leptin also results in an increase in the setpoint for body weight, which is the weight the body wants to maintain. This increase in setpoint leads to increased weight gain in the face of excess energy intake."}
{"question": "What are the effects of globalisation on food security?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wealthy countries subsidies and trade barriers make it difficult for developing countries to take advantage of the potential of globalisation for advancing food security."}, {"label": "B", "text": "World Trade Organisation rules do not cover agriculture, so globalisation really has no bearing on food security."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Supermarkets are so far the only way in which food and agriculture have experienced globalisation."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Developing countries need to create publicly-owned food reserves in order to realise the potential benefits."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Globalisation can have both positive and negative effects on food security.\nOn the one hand, globalisation can increase the availability of food. For example, it can make it possible for countries to import food if they have a shortage. It can also help countries to export food, earning them money to buy food they need.\nOn the other hand, globalisation can also make food security more difficult to achieve. For example, wealthy countries subsidies and trade barriers can make it difficult for developing countries to trade their food. This can make it harder for these countries to improve their food security.\nWorld Trade Organisation rules do not cover agriculture, so globalisation really has no bearing on food security.\nSupermarkets are a way in which food and agriculture have become globalised. But they also have the potential to make food security more difficult to achieve. For example, they can make it difficult for small farmers to sell their products. This can lead to many small farmers going out of business.\nDeveloping countries need to create publicly-owned food reserves in order to realise the potential benefits. Having food reserves can help countries to cope with food shortages. For example, if a country has a food shortage, it can use its food reserves to help feed its people."}

Getting the right mix of substances in your diet is important for your health.\nBut be careful with supplements.\nAlthough some people may need additional nutrients, research suggests that many people don't need to take extra supplements. And in some cases, supplements can be harmful.\nSo, it's important to think about your diet first.\nConsider the dietary recommendations for the nutrients you need. For example, most people can get all the vitamin C they need by eating a variety of fruits and vegetables. But if you're a smoker, or if you have a condition that puts you at higher risk for scurvy, your doctor may recommend that you take a vitamin C supplement.\nIf you're considering a supplement, talk to your doctor first. They can help you determine if you need it and what dose is right for you.\nSOLUTION: Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin. That means your body can't store it. So, you need to consume it every day.\nBut, consuming too much vitamin C can be harmful. Taking high doses of vitamin C supplements can cause stomach upset, and in some cases, it can be dangerous.\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. That means your body can store it. So, you don't need to consume it every day.\nBut, consuming too much vitamin D can be harmful. Taking high doses of vitamin D supplements can cause toxic levels of calcium to build up in your body.\nZinc is an essential trace mineral. That means your body needs it in small amounts.\nConsuming too much zinc can be harmful. Taking high doses of zinc supplements can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin. That means your body can store it.

Some of these functions are:\nIf the gastrointestinal tract did not absorb nutrients from food, the person would die.\nIf the gastrointestinal tract did not eliminate waste, the person would die.\nIf the gastrointestinal tract did not provide a barrier to infection, the person would die.\nIf the gastrointestinal tract did not assist in the absorption and retention of water and electrolytes, the person would die.\nIf the gastrointestinal tract did not extract the maximum value from nutrients, the person would not thrive, but they would not die immediately.\nSOLUTION: After a meal, elimination of toxins is important for survival. The gastrointestinal tract absorbs some toxins and eliminates them from the body.\nMaintenance of barrier function is important for survival. The gastrointestinal tract provides a barrier to infection, keeping harmful bacteria and other pathogens out of the body.\n Absorption and retention of water and electrolytes is important for survival immediately after a meal.\nExtraction of maximum value from nutrients is important for maintaining overall health. This function is important for ensuring that the person gets the nutrients they need to thrive. However, if the person does not get the nutrients they need, they may not thrive, but they will not die immediately."}

It is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating, which is defined as eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Binge eating episodes in BED are usually richer in calories than those of bulimia nervosa (BN). However, this does not mean that BED patients have higher odds of developing obesity.\nThe text tells you that BED patients have a higher risk of obesity. It does not say that every patient with BED will develop obesity.\nSurgery is a treatment option for some people with obesity. Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery that is used to help with weight loss. It is not a treatment option for mild cases of BED.\nSpontaneous remission is a possible outcome for an eating disorder. Spontaneous remission is when a person's eating disorder gets better on its own, without any treatment. This is a rare outcome, and it is not a common outcome for BED."}
{"question": "Although theoretically any food protein could act as a food allergen, there are eight major food allergens in Europe and North America which account for most of the allergic triggers observed in childhood.

But for some people, certain foods are more likely to cause an allergic reaction. These foods are called food allergens.\nSome food allergens are found in unexpected foods. For example, peanuts are a food allergen. But peanuts are not always included in the list of ingredients. So, foods that do not contain peanuts may still have peanut allergens in them.\nCow's milk, egg, and wheat are common food allergens. But cow's milk and egg are not in the same food group as wheat. So, a food allergen to one of these foods is not in the same group as a food allergen to the others.\nMustard seeds and lamb are not in the same food group as any of the major food allergens. So, an allergen to mustard seeds is not in the same group as a food allergen to lamb.\nSoy and peanuts are in the same food group as each other.

Nitrogen balance studies are the primary method of determining the minimum protein requirement.\nAdaptation is a vital component of the body's homeostatic mechanisms. It is a response to an alteration in the environment or to an internal change in the body. Many different types of adaptations are possible, including both short-term and long-term changes.\nThe adaptive metabolic demand is one example of an adaptation. It is a change in the body's metabolism in response to a change in the diet. Specifically, the adaptive metabolic demand refers to the increase in the body's metabolism that occurs after an increase in the diet's protein content. This increase in metabolism means that the body needs more protein to maintain its protein reserve.\nThe efficiency of protein utilization is a measure of how well the body is using its protein. Nitrogen balance studies can be designed to determine the efficiency of protein utilization. One way to do this is to measure the difference between the amount of protein consumed and the amount of protein excreted.\nThe adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of nitrogen balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization. This means that the shorter the period of the nitrogen balance study, the more likely it is that the study will underestimate the efficiency of protein utilization.\nVariable adaptation between different nitrogen balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD. The EAR is an estimate of the average amount of protein consumed by individuals in a population. The EAR is also an estimate of the protein consumption level at which the population's protein requirement is met.\nAdaptation should not influence the interpretation of nitrogen balance studies. This statement is incorrect."}

Some of these types are:\nHigh-density lipoproteins (HDL)\nLow-density lipoproteins (LDL)\nVery low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)\nChylomicrons\nProduction of lipoproteins begins in the small intestine. There, proteins and lipids are taken up by a type of liver cell called the hepatocyte. The proteins and lipids are then combined to form chylomicrons.\nChylomicrons are released into the bloodstream and make their way to cells throughout the body. As they move through the bloodstream, chylomicrons acquire more proteins, becoming larger and larger. Once they have reached a suitable size, chylomicrons release their lipids and proteins to cells.\nVLDL and chylomicrons are produced via the exogenous pathway, which means that they are made in the small intestine and released into the bloodstream.
