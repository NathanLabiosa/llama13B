{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": ""}

The Doppler effect is named after Christian Doppler, who first described the effect in 1842.\nThe Doppler effect is heard as a change in pitch when a vehicle, such as a car, moves toward you or moves away from you. The pitch gets higher as the vehicle moves toward you. The pitch gets lower as the vehicle moves away from you.\nSOLUTION: The frequency of the gunshot is affected by the Doppler effect. The camera is traveling at a different speed than the sound. So, the frequency of the gunshot that the camera picks up is different than the frequency of the gunshot as it was recorded.\nThe frequency of the gunshot is affected by the difference in speed between the camera and the sound. This difference in speed changes the frequency of the gunshot.\nThe frequency of the gunshot is higher than the normal frequency of 800 Hz. So, the perceived frequency is higher than 800 Hz.\nThe difference in speed between the camera and the sound is:\n200 meters / (72 km/h + 108 km/h) hours\nThis difference in speed is:\n200 meters / 21.6 hours = 9.25 hours\nThe frequency of the gunshot is higher by a factor of:\n800 Hz / 9.25 hours = 870 Hz\nSo, the perceived frequency is 870 Hz. This frequency is higher than 924 Hz. So, the gunshot is perceived as being at a higher frequency than 924 Hz."}

When the body's temperature rises, it can release sweat, and the sweat can evaporate, taking heat with it. This is why you may sweat when you exercise or when the temperature outside is high.\nAn increase in temperature outside the body also increases the rate of evaporation of sweat. So, when the environment is hot, the body can cool itself by increasing the rate of sweating and by increasing the rate of evaporation of sweat.\nSOLUTION: When the body's temperature increases, the body can increase the rate of sweating and the rate of evaporation of sweat to cool itself. This can include sweating from the skin, as well as from the lungs and other mucous membranes.\nIncreasing the rate of respiration is one way the body can increase the rate of sweating and the rate of evaporation of sweat.

One of the ways that muscles get the energy they need is by hydrolyzing ATP.\nTwo different types of interactions are involved in muscle contraction: cross-bridge cycling and myosin detachment.\nCross-bridge cycling involves the interaction between myosin and actin. This interaction forms cross-bridges, which pull on actin and cause the myosin to shorten. This shortening pulls on the actin, causing the sarcomere to get shorter.\nThe myosin-actin interaction requires ATP. After the myosin head attaches to the actin, ATP is hydrolyzed. This hydrolysis provides the energy needed to detach the myosin head from the actin.\nAfter the myosin head detaches from the actin, it can return to its starting position. This allows a new cross-bridge to form and the cycle can begin again.\nCalcium-troponin interaction does not directly require ATP. However, it does affect the myosin-actin interaction. Calcium ions bind to troponin. This change in the calcium-troponin interaction moves tropomyosin, which allows the myosin-actin interaction to form cross-bridges.\nTropomyosin-troponin interaction does not directly require ATP. However, the myosin-actin interaction requires tropomyosin to be out of the way. The tropomyosin-troponin interaction is what allows tropomyosin to be moved."}
{"question": "The activity of creatine kinase is:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "increased when intracellular ADP rises."}, {"label": "B", "text": "increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9."}, {"label": "C", "text": "always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres."}, {"label": "D", "text": "increased after a period of endurance training."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Creatine kinase is an enzyme that helps to power high-intensity muscle contractions. How does creatine kinase help to power muscle contractions?\nCreatine kinase helps to power muscle contractions by helping to convert stored energy in the form of ATP into energy that can be used by the muscles. Creatine kinase does this by adding a phosphate group to creatine to form creatine phosphate, also known as phosphocreatine. Creatine phosphate can then be used to create more ATP.\nWhen do muscle cells need more ATP?\nMuscle cells need more ATP during high-intensity muscle contractions. When your muscles need to contract quickly, they cannot wait for ATP to be produced at a slower rate. Instead, they use creatine phosphate to produce more ATP quickly.\nSo, the activity of creatine kinase is increased when intracellular ADP rises.\nWhen do muscle cells produce more ADP?\nMuscle cells produce more ADP during high-intensity muscle contractions. ADP is a byproduct of muscle contractions. When your muscles contract quickly, they produce more ADP.\nSo, the activity of creatine kinase is increased when intracellular ADP rises.\nWhen do muscle pH levels affect creatine kinase activity?\nMuscle pH levels affect creatine kinase activity by affecting the structure of the enzyme. Creatine kinase is a protein. Like other proteins, the structure of creatine kinase is affected by pH. At lower pH levels, the structure of creatine kinase is changed in a way that reduces its activity.\nSo, the activity of creatine kinase is decreased when muscle pH falls below 6.9.\nAre Type I or Type II fibers recruited first during exercise?\nType I fibers are recruited first during exercise. Type I fibers have a higher threshold for contracting than Type II fibers. This means that Type I fibers can contract with more force than Type II fibers. However, once Type I fibers are contracting, they quickly fatigue. This means that they are not able to contract with as much force as before. When Type I fibers fatigue, the muscle begins to recruit Type II fibers.\nSo, Type I fibers are always lower in Type II fibers than Type I fibers.\nDoes endurance training increase the amount of creatine kinase in your muscles?\nEndurance training can increase the amount of creatine kinase in your muscles. Endurance training increases the number of mitochondria in your muscle cells. Mitochondria are the parts of your muscle cells that produce ATP. Since endurance training increases the number of mitochondria in your muscle cells, it also increases the amount of creatine kinase in your muscles."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, what would be an important thing for a person to do after sauna use?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shower in cold water."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exercise."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eat a meal."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Replenish fluids with filtered water."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": ""}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner.

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nWhich of the following is a likely paragraph that follows this excerpt in the article?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A paragraph on a protein that facilitates intracellular function in response to heat."}, {"label": "B", "text": "A paragraph on increased heart attacks in Eskimo populations."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A recap of Finland\u2019s water polo team excellence."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A study on rats exposed to high levels of heat."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": ""}

Most of these mutations have no effect on the function of genes, and so they have no effect on the organism.\nHowever, some mutations can affect the function of genes, and these may have harmful, or bad, effects. For example, some mutations in tumor suppressor genes have the potential to cause cancer.\nOther mutations may have good, or beneficial, effects. For example, a mutation that affects the production of a protein called sickle cell anemia can change the shape of red blood cells and increase the risk of infection, but it may also increase the organism's resistance to malaria."}

Muscles use ATP to drive the formation of a molecule of pyruvic acid from lactic acid.\nDuring high-intensity exercise, the demand for ATP by the muscles can exceed the amount of ATP that can be produced by the body. This excess demand for ATP can result in a buildup of lactic acid, which can lead to fatigue.\nA fall in the cell concentration of ADP, or adenosine diphosphate, is a trigger for the body to begin releasing stored energy. So, a fall in the cell concentration of ADP could contribute to the onset of fatigue.\nHowever, a fall in the cell concentration of ADP does not directly cause a lack of skill.\nInhibition of ATP production, or the failure of the ATP supply to match the demand, can contribute to a lack of ATP.

The pressure decrease is greater at points farther from the source of the fluid. So, the pressure in a capillary is lower than the pressure in a larger vessel from which the capillary is fed.\nIf the capillary is in the neck, the pressure is higher than if the capillary were in the knee. This is because the distance from the heart is smaller in the neck than in the knee. So, the pressure head is greater in the neck than in the knee.\nHowever, the dynamic pressure is equal in both the neck and the knee. The dynamic pressure is the pressure exerted by the fluid that is pushing on the capillary walls. It is equal to the fluid's density times its speed.\nThe density of blood is relatively constant. So, the dynamic pressure is equal to the speed of the blood flow in the capillary. The speed of the blood flow in the capillary is equal on both sides of the circulatory system. So, the dynamic pressure is equal in the neck and in the knee.\nSOLUTION: An increase in pressure head can counterbalance an equal dynamic pressure. So, the pressure in the neck is greater than the pressure in the knee."}

The higher the lactate concentration in the blood, the more intense the exercise.\nDuring a game of soccer, players have periods of high-intensity exercise, such as sprinting, followed by periods of low-intensity exercise, such as walking. The lactate concentration in the blood usually increases during high-intensity exercise and decreases during low-intensity exercise.\nSo, the lactate concentration in the blood usually increases above 3 mM during high-intensity exercise. It is rare for the lactate concentration to stay above 3 mM throughout the game.\nThe lactate concentration in the blood is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. This is because the second half of the game has more high-intensity exercise than the first half.\nThe lactate concentration in the blood is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half.

Here are some ways in which neurons can function:\nDepolarization is a change in the electrical potential of a neuron's membrane that makes it more likely that an action potential will be generated. The following methods can cause depolarization:\nThe flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential.\nThe flow of potassium out of the neuron repolarizes the membrane in the second phase of an action potential.\nThe release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from the neuron's terminals can depolarize the membrane on the next neuron.\nThe binding of neurotransmitters to the next neuron's receptors can depolarize the membrane on the next neuron.\nThe axon hillock is a part of a neuron's membrane that surrounds its axon. An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential.\nThe threshold potential is a low level of depolarization. It is the minimum electrical potential change that must occur across a neuron's membrane to initiate an action potential.\nA neuron's membrane can be polarized, or charged, because it contains some ions, or charged atoms.

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nAccording to the article, which of the following is NOT a benefit of sauna use?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decreased risk of heart attacks."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increase in stroke volume."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Improved mental health."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decreased rate of erectile dysfunction."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The article mentions that sauna use has a positive impact on mental health, including a reduced risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

For example, the EPR is highest for interval training, which includes short periods of intense exercise followed by periods of less intense exercise.\nDuring interval training, the blood glucose concentration may rise or fall depending on whether the body is using more or less glucose than usual, respectively."}
{"question": "During DNA replication, mistakes are coded into the leading strand about once every 100,000/1 million copies. This DNA is subject to proofreading by several mechanisms. If a mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed, this would most likely be the work of which repair mechanism?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "DNA polymerase I"}, {"label": "B", "text": "DNA polymerase III"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mismatch repair mechanism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Endonuclease repair"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: DNA replication is a complex process that can be error-prone. Mistakes in DNA replication can have significant consequences, including the potential for mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer. Cells have multiple mechanisms in place to identify and correct mistakes that are made during replication.\nOne type of repair mechanism is the mismatch repair mechanism. This mechanism is responsible for identifying and correcting base mismatches, which are errors that occur when two bases in a match are not the correct pair. For example, the base adenine (A) should pair with thymine (T), but the base cytosine (C) should pair with guanine (G). If a base mismatch occurs, the mismatch repair mechanism will identify it and remove the incorrect base, typically the base that is not correctly paired.\nAnother type of repair mechanism is endonuclease repair. This mechanism is responsible for cutting out a section of DNA that contains a mistake. This mistake is then removed, and the remaining DNA ends are sealed.\nPolymerase proofreading is another repair mechanism. This type of proofreading is done by the enzyme DNA polymerase, which can remove and correct mistakes that it has made during replication. This type of proofreading is common for polymerase I and polymerase III."}

It is not permeable to potassium ions or to chloride ions.\nThe descending loop of Henle is the area of the nephron that is farthest from the blood supply. Because of this, the water and sodium ions can pass out of the loop and into the interstitial space. This helps to create a concentration gradient for water and sodium ions.\nThe concentration of sodium ions outside the loop is higher than it is inside the loop. This concentration gradient pulls water and sodium ions from the blood into the descending loop."}
