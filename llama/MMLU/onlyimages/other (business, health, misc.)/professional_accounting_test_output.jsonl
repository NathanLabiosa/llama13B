The bonds have a due date of July 1 year 12. Dean incorrectly uses the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium. The premium is $2,500.\nThe effective interest method takes into account the fact that the first and last years of the bond's life have a higher effective interest rate than the middle years. This method allocates more interest to the early years and less to the later years of the bond.\nThe straight-line method allocates the same interest rate to each year. This method allocates more interest to the later years of the bond than to the earlier years.\nThe effect of using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method is that Dean will have overstated its earnings in the first few years and understated its earnings in the last few years.\nThe amount of the premium that is amortized as interest expense using the straight-line method is $2,500 5/(12 x 7) = $1,500. This amount is included in the carrying value of the bond and in the calculation of the company's earnings.\nThe effect of using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method is that the company will have overstated the carrying value of the bond and the earnings for the first few years. It will have understated the carrying value of the bond and the earnings for the last few years.\nSOLUTION: At June 30 year 12, the bond is due in 6 months. No further interest expense will be incurred for the remainder of the bond's life. The carrying value of the bond will not be affected by the error.\nThe error will affect the calculation of earnings. Using the straight-line method to amortize the premium will overstate earnings in the first few years and understate earnings in the last few years. The effect of this will be to overstate the carrying amount of the bond at the time of the error. This amount is included in the calculation of earnings."}

This section is called assets held for sale or assets sold.\nIf a company has not identified the old building as held for sale, it should be classified as a current asset.\nCurrent assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, used up, or converted into an investment within one year.\nDepreciation is a method of allocating the cost of a depreciable asset to its useful life. It is based on the assumption that the asset will be used for its useful life. If a company plans to sell an asset before the end of its useful life, the asset's book value may be higher than its fair market value. In this case, the asset should not be depreciated.\nHistorical cost is the initial cost of an asset. It includes only the amount of money spent to acquire the asset.

The customers are not under the auditor's control, and they may not respond to the request. If the customers do not respond, the auditor cannot determine the accuracy of the client's accounts receivable.\nPrenumbered receiving reports completed by the client\u2019s employees provide more assurance of reliability than receivable confirmations.

This means that if a corporation owes dividends to a holder of cumulative preferred stock but does not pay them, the holder can carry over, or accumulate, those dividends to future years. In other words, the holder is entitled to receive dividends in subsequent years until they have been paid in full.\nGuaranteed dividends means that the corporation must pay a fixed dividend to the holder of the preferred stock every year. Such dividends are not cumulative, which means that if the corporation fails to pay a dividend in a year, the holder of the preferred stock cannot carry over that dividend to future years.\nConversion of the preferred stock into common stock gives the holder of the preferred stock the right to convert, or switch, the preferred stock into common stock. This is an example of a separate feature that is not part of the definition of cumulative preferred stock.\nVoting rights refers to the right to vote on matters affecting the corporation. Cumulative preferred stock does not have voting rights. This means that holders of cumulative preferred stock cannot vote on matters affecting the corporation."}

It involves multiple components that work together to achieve the organization's objectives. One of the components is monitoring.\nMonitoring involves assessing the functioning of the internal control components. It should be done on a regular basis, and the results should be used to make decisions about how to improve the system. Here are some important considerations for establishing a foundation for monitoring:\nFirst, you need to identify the key controls that help the organization achieve its objectives. This may involve reviewing the organization's strategic plan and other relevant documents to determine what the organization wants to achieve.\nThen, you need to identify the key risks that could impact the organization's ability to achieve its objectives. This may involve reviewing the organization's risk register and other relevant documents.\nNext, you need to determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the controls. KPIs are measurements that assess the effectiveness of the controls. They should be specific, measurable, and aligned with the organization's objectives.\nFinally, you need to determine the frequency and methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the controls. This may involve designing monitoring procedures that are prioritized based on risks to achieve organizational objectives.\nThe first step in designing a monitoring system is to identify the specific controls that need to be assessed. This may involve developing a list of the specific controls that help the organization achieve its objectives.\nThen, you need to determine how to assess the effectiveness of each control. This may involve designing procedures that include testing the controls.\nThe next step is to determine the frequency of the assessments. Some controls may need to be assessed more frequently than others. For example, controls that have a high impact on the organization's objectives may need to be assessed more frequently than controls that have a low impact.\nFinally, you need to determine the methodology for assessing the controls. This may involve using a combination of direct testing and indirect measures, such as self-assistance questionnaires.\nThe final step in monitoring is to report the results and follow up on any corrective action that is necessary. This may involve reporting the results to management and taking corrective action in response to the results."}

The maturity date is the date when the issuer must repay the face value of the bond.\nInterest on a bond is payable in arrears. This means that interest is payable on the bond after the end of each interest payment period. The interest payment periods are set by the issuer when the bond is issued.\nSOLUTION: To calculate the bond interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, you must first figure out how long the bond is.\nThe bond has an interest payment date of April 1. The interest payment period starts on April 1 and ends on June 1. So, the bond is for six months.\nThe bond has an interest payment date of October 1. The interest payment period starts on October 1 and ends on December 31. So, the bond is for four months.\nThe bond is for four months, which is less than a year. To calculate the bond interest expense, multiply the face value of the bond by the interest rate and divide by 12.\nThe face value of the bond is $1,000. The interest rate is 6%.\n$1,000 x 6% = $60\n\\$60 / 12 = $5"}

A partner's tax basis in the partnership is reduced by his share of the partnership's liabilities, so the part of the liquidating distribution that is a return of basis is equal to the partner's tax basis in the partnership.\nThe part of the liquidating distribution that is a return of capital is not taxed to the partner. A partner's tax basis in the partnership is reduced by the part of the liquidating distribution that is a return of capital, so the part of the liquidating distribution that is a return of capital is equal to the partner's tax basis in the partnership.\nSOLUTION: Gulde's tax basis in Chyme Partnership was $26,000. The liquidating distribution was $12,000 cash and land with an adjusted basis to Chyme of $10,000 and a fair market value of $30,000.\nThe adjusted basis of the land was $10,000. This is the value of the land in Chyme's account. It is the sum of the land's fair market value and its adjusted basis.\nGulde's share of the partnership's liabilities was $6,000. This is the part of the land's adjusted basis that is a return of basis.\nThe part of the liquidating distribution that is a return of capital was $16,000. This is the difference between the liquidating distribution and the part of the liquidating distribution that is a return of basis.\nGulde's tax basis in the land was $16,000. This is the part of the liquidating distribution that is a return of capital."}

One of the areas that an auditor may examine is the company's depreciation accounts.\nDepreciation is an accounting method that allocates the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. The useful life of a tangible asset is called its remaining useful life.\nWhen a company buys a tangible asset, the cost of the asset is recorded as an expense in the period in which the asset is bought. This initial expense is called the purchase price of the asset.\nThe purchase price of the asset is then allocated to its remaining useful life. Each period, a portion of the purchase price is recorded as a depreciation expense. This portion is called the depreciation rate.\nThe depreciation rate is calculated in a way that the total depreciation expense will equal the remaining cost of the asset at the end of its useful life.\nSOLUTION: An auditor who questions management about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year is looking for an explanation of why the depreciation expense for the current year is higher than in the past.\nThe remaining useful life of a plant asset is a key factor in the amount of depreciation expense that is recorded each period. A higher estimated remaining useful life for plant assets would increase the depreciation expense for the current year compared to the past. So, an auditor who reviews the estimates of remaining useful lives of plant assets could be satisfied with an explanation that focuses on this change.\nPrior years\u2019 depreciation expenses were erroneously understated.\nThis explanation would satisfy an auditor who questions management about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year. If prior years' depreciation expenses were understated, the total depreciation expense for the useful life of the assets would be lower than the actual total depreciation expense. So, the depreciation expense for the current year would be higher than it would have been if the prior year depreciation expenses had been accurately stated.\nCurrent year\u2019s depreciation expense was erroneously understated.\nThis explanation would satisfy an auditor who questions management about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year. If the current year's depreciation expense was understated, the depreciation expense for the current year would be higher than it would have been if the expense had been accurately stated.\nThe estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets were revised upward.\nThis explanation would satisfy an auditor who questions management about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year. If the estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets were revised upward, the depreciation expense for the current year would be higher than it would have been if the estimates had not been revised.\nPlant assets were retired during the current year.\nThis explanation would satisfy an auditor who questions management about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year. If plant assets were retired during the current year, the depreciation expense for the current year would be higher than it would have been if the assets had not been retired."}

This is defined as a situation in which the understatement of tax attributable to the transaction would exceed $10,000.\nIn order to avoid the penalty, the preparer must demonstrate that they had reasonable cause for the position they took. This requires a showing that the preparer had a reasonable basis for the position. This means that the preparer must have a reasonable belief that the position would more likely than not be sustained on its merits.\nThe other factors discussed in the question are relevant to determining whether the preparer had reasonable cause. For example, whether the preparer relied on the advice of a competent professional and whether there was a reasonable possibility of success for the position can be relevant to whether the preparer had reasonable cause.\nHowever, these factors are not independent requirements.

Like other assets, the cost of inventories is assigned to the periods in which they are sold. This is called the inventory cost flow method.\nThere are three methods for assigning the cost of inventories to periods:\nFIFO (First In, First Out) - This method assumes that the items in inventory are sold in the order they were received.\nLIFO (Last In, First Out) - This method assumes that the items in inventory are sold in the order they were received most recently.\nWeighted average - This method takes into account the relative amount of each inventory item.\nCobb uses the weighted average method. The weighted average cost of goods sold is a measure of the average cost of the inventory items that were sold during the month.\nTo calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold, you first need to calculate the total cost of the ending inventory. This can be done by taking the total cost of the inventory at May 1 and adding the cost of purchases during the month.\nThen, you need to calculate the weighted average of the cost of the units in the ending inventory. To do this, divide the total cost of the ending inventory by the number of units in the ending inventory.\nFinally, use the weighted average cost of the units in the ending inventory to determine the weighted average cost of goods sold.\nSOLUTION: To calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold, first calculate the total cost of the ending inventory.\nThe total cost of the ending inventory is $1250 + $440 = $1790.\nThen, calculate the weighted average of the cost of the units in the ending inventory.\n1790 / (20 + 80) = $62.50\nFinally, use the weighted average cost of the units in the ending inventory to determine the weighted average cost of goods sold.\n$62.50 x 10 = $65."}

The cost of direct materials was $114,000 and the cost of direct labor amounted to $38,000. Manufacturing overhead is assigned at the rate of 50% of direct materials.\nThe cost of goods manufactured in April includes the cost of materials, the cost of conversion, and the manufacturing overhead. The conversion cost is 50% complete as to materials, so the beginning conversion cost was $57,000. The total cost of goods manufactured in April is $114,000 + $38,000 + ($57,000/2) = $208,000.\nThe cost per equivalent whole unit is the total cost of goods manufactured in April divided by the number of equivalent whole units. The number of equivalent whole units is 10,000, the number started in April. So, the cost per equivalent whole unit is $208,000 / 10,000 = $21."}

This type of accounting matches revenue and expenses in the period in which they are incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged.\nCash accounting is used by businesses that want to report the effects of their transactions on their financial position and performance without having to use accounting definitions. This type of accounting matches cash inflows and outflows in the period in which they are received or paid, respectively.\nSOLUTION: Research and development (R&D) costs are initially expensed, or charged to expense, when incurred. This means that these costs are not capitalized, or charged to a separate asset account, but are instead included in an income statement for the current period.\nCapitalizing R&D costs would lead to the creation of an asset with no foreseeable future benefit, which would not be in compliance with the concept of capitalizing costs with a future benefit.\nAccumulating all R&D costs in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the existence of future benefits can be determined would violate the relevance and reliability principles. This is because the future benefit of R&D costs is uncertain, and it may be many years before these benefits are realized.\nBy the time the benefits are realized, the information may be less relevant to investors and may be difficult to compare with the benefits of other periods."}

Under transfer pricing, each market is assigned a price, and the firm charges the price that it has assigned to that market.\nFor transfer pricing to result in an establishment of a price to external customers that is higher than the competitive price, the price that the firm charges in each market must be higher than the price that the firm would charge if it were to compete in each market.\nIf the prices that the firm charges in each market are higher than the prices that the firm would charge if it were to compete in each market, then the firm can increase its profitability by using transfer pricing. This is because transfer pricing allows the firm to charge a price to external customers that is higher than the price that it would charge if it were to compete.\nCollusive pricing, dual pricing, and predatory pricing are pricing policies that can also result in an establishment of a price to external customers that is higher than the competitive price.

These costs are \"sunk\", or lost, because they were spent in the past.\nSunk costs can be used to justify a company's past decisions. For example, if a company has spent a lot of money on a factory, it may want to keep the factory in operation, even if it is not profitable, because of the sunk costs involved.\nOpportunity costs are the costs of a decision. Specifically, they are the benefits that a decision avoids. For example, the opportunity cost of choosing to work overtime is the value of the leisure time that is given up.\nIncremental costs are the costs of a particular decision. These costs can include the cost of additional materials, the cost of additional labor, and the cost of increased energy use.\nPrime costs are the costs that remain after the manufacturing process is complete.

It represents the excess return of a stock over the return that can be justified by its beta and the return on a benchmark index.\nA beta is a measure of how much a stock's return is expected to change in response to a change in the return on a benchmark index. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock's return is expected to change by an amount that is proportionate to the change in the benchmark index's return.\nSOLUTION: The regression models use the beta and the return on a benchmark index to estimate the return that can be justified by the stock's beta. This estimated return is then added to the residuals to obtain the alpha of the stock returns.\nThe estimated alpha is minimised when the model fits the errors to obtain a more precise estimate of the stock's beta. This means that the model is removing the parts of the stock's return that are not related to the return on the benchmark index.\nThe estimated alpha is equal to the alpha of stock returns and their dependence on the market returns.

The auditor's concern is that the financial statements may not be representative of the entity's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows if the entity is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe financial statements may not be accurate or relevant if the entity has to liquidate or significantly change its operations. As a result, the financial statements may not meet the criteria for financial statement presentation.\nThe auditor's evaluation of the possible effects of substantial doubt on the entity's financial statements is based on the corollary to the going-concern assumption. The corollary states that if the entity cannot continue as a going concern, the financial statements are prepared under the assumption that the entity will be able to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time not exceeding 12 months.\nThe control environment factors that affect the organizational structure include the entity's organizational chart, the reporting structure, and the formalizes policies and procedures.

As inflation causes the prices of the items in the most recent production batches to increase, the last items produced are also the most expensive items. So, when they are eventually sold, they will have a higher cost than the items in the previous production batches. This results in a higher ending inventory value under LIFO.\nThe higher ending inventory value under LIFO also results in a higher income tax payable. This is because the inventory is valued higher for tax purposes under LIFO, which means that the company is taxed on a higher income amount.\nSOLUTION: During a period of inflation, the ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO will be higher than FIFO."}

Goodwill is a legal and accounting fiction, meaning that it is a made-up value that is recorded on the balance sheet.\nThe concept of recognizing goodwill in the balance sheet is discussed in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. This standard explains that goodwill should be recognized in the balance sheet at the fair value of the assets acquired minus the fair value of the liabilities assumed.\nGoodwill should not be recognized in the following situations:\nIf the purchase price is equal to the fair market value of the net assets acquired.\nIf the purchase price is below the fair market value of the net assets acquired, but the goodwill is not identifiable.\nIf the purchase price is below the fair market value of the net assets acquired, and the goodwill is identifiable, but the company does not expect to derive future benefits from the goodwill.\nIf the purchase price is below the fair market value of the net assets acquired, and the goodwill is identifiable, and the company expects to derive future benefits from the goodwill, the goodwill should be recognized in the balance sheet.\nThe company should recognize goodwill in the balance sheet at the fair market value of the assets acquired minus the fair market value of the liabilities assumed. This calculation determines the value of the goodwill.\nThe fair market value of the assets acquired includes the fair market value of all tangible and intangible assets of the business acquired.\nThe fair market value of the liabilities assumed includes the fair market value of all tangible and intangible liabilities of the business acquired.\nIf the fair market value of the assets acquired is greater than the book value of the assets, the company should recognize goodwill. This is shown in the equation:\nFair market value of the assets acquired - Book value of the assets = Goodwill\nIf the fair market value of the assets acquired is less than the book value of the assets, no goodwill is created.\nThe company should recognize goodwill at the fair market value of the assets acquired minus the fair market value of the liabilities assumed. This calculation determines the value of the goodwill.\nIf the fair market value of the assets acquired is greater than the book value of the assets, the company should recognize goodwill. This is shown in the equation:\nFair market value of the assets acquired - Book value of the assets = Goodwill\nIf the fair market value of the assets acquired is less than the book value of the assets, no goodwill is created.\nSOLUTION: Goodwill is created when a company purchases another company's business. Goodwill is a result of the premium that the company is willing to pay for the business above and beyond the fair market value of the net assets of the business.\nThe fair market value of the assets of the business acquired exceeds the book value of the assets of the business. So, the company expects a future benefit from the creation of goodwill."}

Properties can be depreciated, which means that their value decreases over time.\nDepreciation is a process that happens through a series of charges to the asset account. The asset account is a contra-asset account to the liability account that was used to purchase the asset.\nWhen you depreciate a machine (or any other asset), you decrease the balance in the asset account by a certain amount each year. This decrease is called a depreciation expense.\nThe double-declining balance method is a method of depreciation. This method applies double the declining balance rate to the asset account for the first year. In other words, the balance in the asset account is decreased by two times the declining balance rate. For the second year, the declining balance rate is multiplied by the remaining balance in the asset account, and the result is subtracted from the balance in the asset account.\nThe declining balance rate is a percentage. It is calculated as follows:\nDeclining balance rate = 2 \u00d7 the straight line rate\nThe straight line rate is a percentage that tells you how long it will take for the machine to lose half its value. To calculate the straight line rate, use the following formula:\nStraight line rate = (8 years \u00d7 100%) \u00f7 8\nFor Hall Co., the straight line rate is 100% \u00f7 8 = 12.5%.\nSo, the declining balance rate is 2 \u00d7 12.5% = 25%.\nThe carrying amount of a machine is the same as its book value. To find the carrying amount, calculate the depreciation expense for the second year using the declining balance rate, and subtract it from the machine's initial cost.\nThe initial cost of the machine was $140,000. The declining balance rate is 25%. So, the depreciation expense for the second year is $140,000 \u00f7 25% = $56,000.\nThe carrying amount of the machine at the end of its second year of operations is $140,000 - $56,000 = $84,000."}

Inspection of in-process goods involves inspecting materials and products during production. This technique can help identify problems early, but it does not provide data on whether the quality of the products is improving.\nRecording the number of products returned over time is an effective way to measure improvements in product quality. Returned products may result from internal failure costs. By recording the number of products returned over time, you can tell whether the number of failures is decreasing.\nTracking the number of products reworked is an effective way to measure improvements in product quality. Reworking products may result from internal failure costs. By tracking the number of products reworked, you can tell whether the number of failures is decreasing.\nTracking warranty expenses over time is not a direct way to measure improvements in product quality.

The penalty can be up to $5,000 for each failure to investigate.\nThe fact that the CPA may be assistant does not mean that the CPA committed fraud. Fraud involves a deliberate intent to mislead or deceive. A tax return preparer penalty is not the same as a fraud penalty.\nIf the IRS determines that the CPA's behavior was fraudulent, the CPA may be charged with preparing a fraudulent return. This can result in a $100,000 penalty and imprisonment.\nEven if the CPA is not charged with preparing a fraudulent return, the client may still be subject to penalties.

In year 5 the stock split 2-for-1. In the current year Lemon sold 800 shares. What is Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "$4,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "$8,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "$8,400"}, {"label": "D", "text": "16800"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: In year 5, the stock split 2-for-1, which means that Lemon received two shares of stock for each one he owned before the split. So, Lemon owned 2000 shares x 2 = 4000 shares after the split.\nIn year 4, Lemon received a 5% non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock. Since the dividend was non-taxable, the number of shares Lemon received did not increase his basis.\nLemon sold 800 shares. To find his basis in the shares he sold, add the number of shares sold to the number of shares received in the non-taxable dividend. Subtract the number of shares sold in previous sales to find his basis in the shares he purchased in year 1.\n800 shares + 4000 shares - 800 shares = 4000 shares\nLemon's basis in the 800 shares sold is $4,000."}

The nature of the tests of details will depend on the specific material risks, the nature of the financial statement accounts, and the auditor's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control.\nThe objective of tests of details is to provide the auditor with the evidence needed to support an assessment of the firm's financial statements. This evidence can include both positive evidence that the financial statements are free of material misstatements and negative evidence that any material misstatements are not buried in the financial statements.\nTests of details can include the following procedures:\ninspecting documents, such as contracts or sales orders, that support accounts in the financial statements;\nexamining source documents to verify the accuracy of information included in financial statements;\ncomparing information in the financial statements to external data sources, such as market prices or industry averages; and\nperforming procedural tests, such as requesting samples of transactions from the company's records and performing a manual review of the transactions.\nTests of details can be designed to address the material risks identified in the planning phase. Material misstatements can occur as a result of errors, fraud, or both. The auditor's tests of details should be designed to detect these types of misstatements.\nThe auditor's purpose is to provide an audit that will detect material misstatements that are reasonsably possible to miss. The planned level of control risk is determined by the auditor's assessment of the risk that the financial statements are misstated due to the absence of effective internal control. The lower the assessment of control risk, the more likely the auditor's tests of details will detect material misstatements that are reasonsably possible to miss.\nSOLUTION: The planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level is a measure of the auditor's objective to provide an audit that will detect material misstatements. It does not describe the nature of the evidence the auditor plans to obtain.\nThe effectiveness of internal controls is a matter of the auditor's professional judgment.

The equity method assumes that the investor and the investee are related from a financial reporting perspective.\nIn general, an investment in common stock gives the investor the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. As a result, the equity method can be used for investments in common stock.\nAn investment in preferred stock does not provide the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. So, the equity method cannot be used for investments in preferred stock.\nAn investment in bonds does not provide the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. So, the equity method cannot be used for investments in bonds.\nThe only factor that affects whether Goll can use the equity method is whether Goll has the ability to exercise significant influence over Rose and Jave. The answer to this question is not provided in the text.\nSOLUTION: To use the equity method, Goll must have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rose and Jave. If Goll does not have this ability, the equity method cannot be used for either investment.\nIf Goll does have this ability, the equity method can be used for one or both investments.

Bonds are usually issued for a period of more than 10 years. Notes are short-term debt instruments that are usually issued for 10 years or less.\nWhen a corporation buys a debt security, such as a bond or a note, the security is recorded on the corporation's balance sheet at its cost. The corporation will also record an equal amount in a separate account for the applicable income tax.\nThe corporation will then report the debt security on its income statement for each accounting period. For a debt security with a fixed payment schedule, the corporation will report the interest that the security pays. For a available-for-sale debt security, the corporation will report the unrealized gain or loss.\nThe unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the security's fair value and its cost basis.

It is the discount rate that makes the NPV of the project equal to zero.\nBoth the NPV and the IRR can be used to compare investment projects. Here are some ways in which they can differ:\nThe NPV can be influenced by the market rate of interest. This means that the ranking of projects by NPV may change if the market interest rate changes.\nThe IRR is not influenced by the market rate of interest. This means that the ranking of projects by IRR will not change if the market interest rate changes.\nThe IRR may not be unique. This means that two or more projects can have the same IRR.\nThe IRR may change the ranking of projects. This occurs when projects with the same IRR have different NPVs. In such cases, the IRR will put a project with a lower NPV ahead of a project with a higher NPV.\nSOLUTION: When comparing investment projects, use the IRR to rank the projects and use the NPV to evaluate the projects in each rank.\nThe IRR will never change the ranking of the projects. So, the projects will be ranked in the same order by the IRR as they are by the NPV."}

Under this method, income is taxed in the year it is earned, not when it is received. Likewise, expenses are taxed in the year they are incurred, not when they are paid.\nCapital assets are assets that a business uses in its operations or that it holds for investment. For federal income tax purposes, the following are capital assets:\nA capital asset is any asset that you own for investment.\nYou buy most capital assets with cash or exchange other property for them.\nYou do not use the assets in your business or in your trade.\nExamples of capital assets include stocks, bonds, and real estate.\nFor most capital assets, you can deduct all or part of the cost of the asset over a number of years.\nThe cost of the asset is recovered gradually through depreciation.\nDepreciation is an allocation of the cost of the asset to the years in which the asset is used.\nThe depreciation period and method are based on the type of asset.\nFor example, the recovery period for a tree is 10 years. The method for figuring depreciation for a car is the straight-line method.\nYou must use the method that the IRS prescribes for each type of asset.\nIf you sell a capital asset for more than you paid for it, you may be able to keep the profit. This is called a capital gain.\nYou must report capital gains on your tax return. You may have to pay tax on them.\nIf you sell a capital asset for less than you paid for it, you may have a capital loss. You can use a capital loss to offset capital gains.\nYou may be able to use a capital loss to offset other types of income. If you have a capital loss that is more than your capital gains, you may be able to use the difference to offset other income.\nSOLUTION: For federal income tax purposes, a business can deduct the cost of machinery and equipment used in its business over a number of years.

In this case, the acquisition costs should be allocated on a pro rata basis to the nonmonetary assets acquired.\nOtherwise, the acquisition costs should be capitalized as part of goodwill and tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is a residual asset that arises when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the net assets acquired.

It involves taking a sample of items from the population and testing them to determine whether the results of the audit are in error.\nThe objective of statistical sampling is to assess the risk of material misstatement based on the results of the sample. The sample results are used to calculate an assessment of the risk of material misstatement. This assessment can be used to plan the remaining audit procedures.\nThe sample rate of deviation is the sample results' indication of the risk of material misstatement. The lower the sample rate of deviation, the lower the risk of material misstatement.\nThe allowance for sampling risk is the auditor's assessment of the risk that the audit may fail to detect a material misstatement if one exists. The allowance for sampling risk is added to the sample rate of deviation to determine the acceptable risk of material misstatement.\nThe tolerable rate of deviations is the maximum rate of deviation from the expected values that the auditor can accept. The tolerable rate of deviations is set based on the client's financial statements and the auditor's assessment of the risks associated with the client's operations.\nIf the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate of deviations, it indicates that the risk of material misstatement is too high. In this case, the auditor must reduce the planned reliance on the prescribed control. This means that the auditor must do more substantive testing in order to reduce the risk of material misstatement.\nSOLUTION: The sample results indicate that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate. So, the auditor must reduce the planned reliance on the prescribed control."}

Material misstatements can arise from fraudulent financial reporting.\nFraudulent financial reporting involves intentional misstatements of financial statements. Such misstatements can be made with the goal of deceiving investors, creditors, or other financial statement users.\nAn auditor's ability to detect fraudulent financial reporting is influenced by the auditor's professional skepticism. Professional skepticism involves a questioning mindset that accepts nothing at face value. This mindset is important because fraudulent financial reporting often involves manipulations that are hidden from view.\nManagement's display of a significant disregard for regulatory authorities increases an auditor's concern that management may be engaging in fraudulent financial reporting. Such a disregard for authorities could indicate that management is willing to break the law to meet financial statement goals.\nA lack of turnover of employees in the accounting department increases an auditor's concern that employees in the accounting department may be involved in fraudulent financial reporting. Constant turnover in the accounting department could make it difficult to uncover fraud.\nMonthly bank reconciliations usually include several deposits in transit. This indicates that there are delays in recording cash transactions, and the cash balance in the financial statements may not be entirely accurate. However, this by itself is not reason to believe that there is a risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting.\nEquipment is usually sold at a loss before being fully depreciated.
