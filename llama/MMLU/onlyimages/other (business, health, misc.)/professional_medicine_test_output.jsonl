According to the fluid mosaic model of membrane structure, the concentration of a protein on the membrane is a function of the afferent and efferent flow rates and the protein's mobility.\nThe filtration coefficient (Kf) is a measure of the ratio of filtration to capillary pressure. It is a measure of the ease with which the protein can filter through the glomerular capillary walls. Kf is determined by the following formula:\nKf = (afferent flow rate / efferent flow rate) / (capillary pressure / hydrostatic pressure)\nIf the efferent arteriole is constricted, the hydrostatic pressure in the glomeruli increases. But the oncotic pressure and the filtration coefficient do not change. So, the hydrostatic pressure in the glomeruli is most likely to change.\nThe hydrostatic pressure is a measure of the pressure that is exerted on the glomerular capillary walls by the blood. It is determined by the following formula:\nhydrostatic pressure = oncotic pressure / (2 / R) - capillary pressure\nThe oncotic pressure is the pressure that is exerted on the glomerular capillary walls by the plasma. It is determined by the following formula:\noncotic pressure = R / (2 / R) - capillary pressure\nThe capillary pressure is the pressure that is exerted on the glomerular capillary walls by the blood in the afferent arteriole. It is determined by the following formula:\ncapillary pressure = 100 mm Hg - hydrostatic pressure\nSOLUTION: A vascular clamp is placed on the efferent arteriole. The hydrostatic pressure in the glomeruli increases, but the oncotic pressure and the filtration coefficient do not change. So, the hydrostatic pressure in the glomeruli is most likely to change."}

The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for transmitting signals from the viscera to the spinal cord.\nSignals from the epigastric region are transmitted to the spinal cord by the anterior rami of the thoracic and abdominal sympathetic nerves. The anterior rami of the thoracic and abdominal sympathetic nerves are branches of the sympathetic trunk. The sympathetic trunk is a chain of sympathetic ganglia that is located on both sides of the spinal column.\nThe anterior rami of the thoracic and abdominal sympathetic nerves transmit signals from the epigastric region to the spinal cord. These signals are then transmitted to the hypothalamus and medulla. The hypothalamus and medulla are parts of the brain.\nThe posterior rami of the thoracic and abdominal sympathetic nerves are also branches of the sympathetic trunk. But, the posterior rami transmit signals from the posterior abdominal viscera to the spinal cord. The posterior abdominal viscera include the small intestine, colon, and rectum.\nSOLUTION: Referred pain is pain that is felt in a part of the body that is distant from the source of the pain. Referred pain in the abdomen is often caused by inflammation or irritation of the stomach or intestines.\nThe anterior rami of the thoracic and abdominal sympathetic nerves transmit signals from the epigastric region to the spinal cord.

This indicates that the patient has a block in the conduction of electrical impulses within the heart.\nA block in the conduction of electrical impulses within the heart can cause a wide QRS complex, which is seen in the ECG. The width of the QRS complex is determined by the distance that the electrical impulse must travel from the atria to the ventricles. In general, the wider the QRS complex, the longer the distance that the electrical impulse must travel.\nThere are several types of blocks in the conduction of electrical impulses within the heart. The type of block that is most likely to cause a wide QRS complex is a third-degree atrioventricular block. This type of block affects the conduction of electrical impulses in the bundle branches, which are branches of the bundle of His.\nA third-degree atrioventricular block is a complete block in the conduction of electrical impulses within the bundle branches. This type of block can cause a wide QRS complex and a irregular heartbeat.\nA right bundle branch block is a type of conduction disorder. In a right bundle branch block, the electrical impulse moves through a slower route than normal. This type of block can cause a widening of the QRS complex, but the distance that the electrical impulse must travel is not increased.\nA second-degree atrioventricular block, type I, is a block in the conduction of electrical impulses within the bundle of His. This type of block can cause a wide QRS complex, but the distance that the electrical impulse must travel is not increased.\nA second-degree atrioventricular block, type II, is a block in the conduction of electrical impulses within the bundle of His and the bundle branches.

This average is calculated from the patient's daily glucose readings, so it is likely that the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations are more accurate than his hemoglobin A1c.\nThe patient's mother says that he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. This suggests that the patient's daily glucose control is not as good as his hemoglobin A1c indicates.\nA glucometer is a device that measures blood glucose concentrations. Glucometers can be affected by high or low temperatures, as well as damage to the device. So, it is possible that the glucometer is reading falsely high.\nLaboratory error can occur when drawing blood, sending samples to the lab, or processing the samples in the lab. The patient's hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated.\nSOLUTION: A hemoglobin A1c level is a good estimate of a patient's average blood glucose level over the past 8-12 weeks. This estimate is used to determine whether a patient's diabetes is well controlled.\nThe patient's hemoglobin A1c is 5.4%, which indicates that his average blood glucose level was 140 mg/dL. This level is higher than most people's optimal range, which is 4-6%. So, the patient's diabetes is not well controlled.\nThe patient's daily glucose control is better than his hemoglobin A1c indicates. His hemoglobin A1c is 5.4%, which indicates that his average blood glucose level was 140 mg/dL. But, his home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations have been as high as 200 mg/dL. So, his daily glucose control is not as good as it should be."}

Gynecomastia can be caused by an imbalance in the ratio of estrogens to androgens. The patient's serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges, which suggests that the imbalance is not due to a hormonal disorder.\nOne possible cause of gynecomastia is an estrogen-secreting tumor. These tumors can be either ovarian or testicular. The patient's examination shows normal testes, so an estrogen-secreting testicular tumor is unlikely. An ovarian tumor is also unlikely, since the patient is a 14-year-old boy.\nAnother possible cause of gynecomastia is Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by the development of pigmented macules on the skin and mucous membranes, and by the growth of glandular breast tissue in males. The patient's examination shows normal testes, so Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is unlikely.\nSeminiferous tubule dysgenesis, also known as Klinefelter syndrome, is a condition in which males are born with an extra X chromosome. This condition can cause gynecomastia. The patient's examination shows normal testes, so Klinefelter syndrome is unlikely.\nNormal development is also a possibility. In some males, breast tissue can develop during puberty without any underlying disorder."}

{"question": "A 57-year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "G0"}, {"label": "B", "text": "G1"}, {"label": "C", "text": "G2"}, {"label": "D", "text": "M"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A cell's cycle consists of two main phases: the G0 phase and the G1, S, and G2 phases.\nDuring the G0 phase, a cell is in a dormant state. It does not do any cell cycle activities.\nDuring the G1 phase, a cell begins to prepare for the S phase.\nDuring the S phase, or synthesis phase, a cell replicates its DNA.\nDuring the G2 phase, a cell prepares for the M phase.\nDuring the M phase, or mitosis phase, a cell divides to form two daughter cells.\nThe cell cycle may be interrupted by many events. For example, a cell may be triggered to enter the G2 phase by a signal that tells it to stop dividing.\nA cell's progression from one phase of the cell cycle to the next is called cell cycle progression.\nA cell's ability to progress through the cell cycle is called cell cycle progression.\nA cell's ability to enter certain phases of the cell cycle is called cell cycle arrest.\nWhen a cell is arrested in a phase of the cell cycle, it cannot progress to the next phase.\nArrest in the G0 phase is called G0 arrest.\nArrest in the G1 phase is called G1 arrest.\nArrest in the S phase is called replication arrest.\nArrest in the G2 phase is called G2 arrest.\nArrest in the M phase is called mitotic arrest.\nSOLUTION: A point mutation in the p53 gene leads to an inactive p53 gene product. The p53 gene product is involved in cell cycle arrest.\nWhen the p53 gene product is inactive, cells may not be able to arrest their progression through the cell cycle. This may lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer.\nThe progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which the tumor cells are unable to arrest their progression through the cell cycle.\nThe tumor cells are unable to arrest in the G1 phase. So, the progressive tumor growth is most likely to be related to a defect in G1 arrest."}

Look at the combination of genes in the organism's genome for the gene that affects that trait. Some genes have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genome has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genome has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA organism with the dominant allele's version of a gene's trait is called a homozygous dominant organism for that gene.\nAn organism with the recessive allele's version of a gene's trait is called a homozygous recessive organism for that gene.\nA organism with two different alleles for a gene is called a heterozygous organism for that gene.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a couple's offspring will have a certain genotype. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this couple has a son with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4."}

{"question": "A 16-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by emergency medical technicians because of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that began 25 minutes ago and has continued despite administration of 0.5 mg/kg rectal diazepam 10 minutes ago. The patient was at home at the time of the seizure. In the emergency department, she is given an additional 0.5 mg/kg dose of diazepam intravenously and the convulsion terminates. Within 2 minutes, her oxygen saturation drops to 75% and she appears cyanotic. Respirations are 10/min and shallow. She receives bag-valve-mask ventilation, followed by intubation and mechanical ventilation. Medical history is unremarkable. She takes no medications. Temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F). Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Airway occlusion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Encephalitis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Meningitis"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "Assistant: LECTURE: Central respiratory drive refers to the ability of the brain to stimulate respiration. The major central respiratory drive is mediated by the respiratory center in the brainstem.\nMedications can suppress central respiratory drive. This is one of the side effects of the drug diazepam, which was given to the patient in this case. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine, a class of drugs that acts on the GABA receptor. One of the effects of benzodiazepines is to decrease the excitability of the respiratory center.\nSymptoms of central respiratory drive suppression include shallow breathing and slow respiration. These symptoms can be potentiated by other factors, such as elevated temperature.\nMeningitis is an infection of the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis can cause central respiratory drive suppression.\nEncephalitis is an infection of the brain. Like meningitis, encephalitis can cause central respiratory drive suppression.\nAirway occlusion is a blockage in the airway. This can include blockages in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, or trachea. Airway occlusion can cause respiratory insufficiency by preventing air from entering the lungs.\nDuring an anoxic seizure, a seizure that occurs in the absence of oxygen, the patient's airway may be obstructed. This can cause respiratory insufficiency.\nSOLUTION: The patient in this case was given diazepam, which can suppress central respiratory drive. Diazepam was administered rectally 10 minutes before the seizure stopped. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped 2 minutes after the seizure stopped. This is a time frame that is consistent with the effects of diazepam.\nThe patient's history of taking no medications and her fever suggest that meningitis is less likely to be the underlying cause of her respiratory insufficiency.\nEncephalitis is a disease that affects the brain. It is possible that encephalitis is the underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency, but it is less likely than medication-induced central respiratory drive suppression.\nAirway occlusion and diazepam-induced central respiratory drive suppression can cause similar symptoms. However, airway occlusion is a blockage in the airway, which can be caused by a variety of factors. In this case, the patient was not observed to have an airway occlusion."}

Behavioral disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD), are conditions that can affect a child's behavior, development, and relationships.\nMany different factors can contribute to behavioral disorders. Research has shown that diet and nutrition can play a role in the development of these disorders. For example, a study of children with ADHD found that many of them had low levels of certain nutrients, including foods that are high in zinc, iron, and vitamin B6.\nIt is important to use a multidisciplinary approach to manage behavioral disorders. This means that a team of healthcare professionals, including a child psychiatrist, may work with the child and their family to manage the disorder.\nThe four most common behavioral disorders are ADHD, ODD, CD, and autism spectrum disorder.\nADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects attention, cognition, and behavior. Symptoms of ADHD include hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention.\nODD is a disorder that affects a child's mood, behavior, and relationships.

This force is determined by the cardiac output (the amount of blood the heart pumps in a minute) and the resistance in the peripheral vasculature (the resistance of the arteries).\nCardiac output is a function of stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each beat) and heart rate (the number of beats per minute).\nStroke volume is a function of contractility (the strength of the heart muscle) and end-diastolic volume (the volume of blood in the heart at the beginning of ventricular filling).\nPeripheral vascular resistance is a measure of the resistance of the arteries to the flow of blood. It is determined by the diameter of the arteries and the pressure of the blood.\nSOLUTION: Increased peripheral vascular resistance is the most likely mechanism to increase blood pressure further. When peripheral vascular resistance is increased, the resistance of the arteries to blood flow is increased. This increases the pressure of the blood in the arteries, which raises blood pressure.\nDecreased stroke volume, decreased pulse, and decreased cardiac output could also increase blood pressure further. However, these mechanisms decrease the cardiac output and stroke volume. So, they are less likely to increase blood pressure further than peripheral vascular resistance."}

So, a killed vaccine does not reproduce in the body. This means that a killed vaccine cannot cause an infection or lead to reversion to virulence.\nA live vaccine is made of viruses that are alive but weakened. So, a live vaccine can reproduce in the body and cause an infection. This means that a live vaccine has the concern for reversion to virulence.\nA killed vaccine develops immunity by causing the body to produce antibodies. The antibodies remain in the body and provide immunity.\nA live vaccine develops immunity by reproducing the virus in the body. The reproduced virus stimulates the body to produce antibodies.\nA killed vaccine is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity than a live vaccine. This is because a killed vaccine already creates a response that generates antibodies.\nA live vaccine is more effective than a killed vaccine in generating mucosal immunity. Mucosal immunity is immunity in mucous membranes, such as in the respiratory system."}

Hypoparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid gland, which is located in the neck. The parathyroid gland helps regulate the amount of calcium and vitamin D in the body.\nHyperparathyroidism is a disorder in which the parathyroid gland produces too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps increase the amount of calcium in the blood. Low blood calcium levels trigger the release of PTH.\nIn hypoparathyroidism, the parathyroid gland does not release enough PTH. As a result, blood calcium levels decrease. This can cause symptoms such as cramping, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet.

The most appropriate next step in management is ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the mass.\nNeedle aspiration is a safe and effective way to diagnose an STI. It is less invasive than incision and drainage and leaves no scar.\nIncision and drainage is a more invasive procedure that should be reserved for cases in which an abscess is drained.\nIntravenous metronidazole and intravenous penicillin G are appropriate choices for the treatment of an STI. They are effective against many different types of STIs, including Gonococcal infection.\nAn ultrasound is a diagnostic tool that uses sound waves to create images of structures within the body. It can be used to guide the needle during needle aspiration."}

A patient's right to beneficence means that he or she has the right to receive medical care that will benefit him or her. A patient's right to justice means that he or she has the right to receive medical care that is equal and fair. A patient's right to nonmaleficence means that he or she has the right to receive medical care that does not harm him or her.\nHIV testing with informed consent, counseling, and partner notification is a process that involves several ethical principles. The principle of autonomy tells you that the physician should respect the patient's right to make decisions about his or her own care. The principle of beneficence tells you that the physician should provide medical care that will benefit the patient. The principle of justice tells you that the physician should provide medical care that is equal and fair. The principle of nonmaleficence tells you that the physician should provide medical care that does not harm the patient.\nSOLUTION: In this case, the physician is recommending that the patient inform his wife of the patient's HIV positive status. The physician is not withholding information from the patient. The principle of beneficence is the most important principle in this case. The physician is recommending that the patient inform his wife in order to prevent the wife from becoming infected with HIV."}
