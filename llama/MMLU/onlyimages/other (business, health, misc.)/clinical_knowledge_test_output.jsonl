An upper motor neuron lesion does not directly affect the muscles. So, the muscles continue to receive a signal to contract, but the signal is now interrupted. As a result, the muscles remain in a contracted state, which is called hypertonia.\nA lower motor neuron lesion affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord or the brain stem. A lower motor neuron lesion directly affects the muscles. So, the muscles do not receive a signal to contract. As a result, the muscles remain in a relaxed state, which is called hypotonia.\nFasciculations are small, local twitches of a muscle. Fasciculations are seen when there is an upper motor neuron lesion.\nBrisk reflexes are seen when there is an upper motor neuron lesion.\nAn upper motor neuron lesion can cause a loss of function in the muscles.

This is a good sign, as 90% of all nodules are benign.\nLymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign. This means that if a thyroid swelling is accompanied by enlarged lymph nodes, the chance of the nodule being cancerous is lower. But lymph node enlargement does not tell you whether a nodule is cancerous or not.\nAn ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone. Ultrasound can tell you whether a nodule is solid or fluid-filled, and whether it is growing. But ultrasound cannot tell you whether a nodule is cancerous.\nIt always elevates on swallowing. This means that the thyroid gland moves upward when you swallow. This does not tell you whether a nodule is cancerous."}

When the body cannot remove lactate quickly enough, it may accumulate in the blood. But during a soccer game, players typically have a high enough level of fitness that their blood lactate concentration rarely increases above 3 mM.\nDuring a soccer game, players become more fatigued as the game goes on. So, the lactate concentration in their blood may increase throughout the course of the game.\nDuring a soccer game, the half-time break allows players to rest and recover. So, the lactate concentration in their blood may be higher at the end of the first half than at the end of the game.\nThe intensity of a soccer game varies throughout the game.

Inflammatory arthritis is a disease that causes joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.\nAs with other types of inflammatory arthritis, the diagnosis of psoriatic arthropathy is based on a combination of factors. Here are some things that may suggest that a patient has psoriatic arthropathy:\nThe presence of psoriasis. Patients with psoriatic arthropathy usually have a history of psoriasis.\nJoint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Psoriatic arthropathy can cause inflammation in and around the joints.\nEntheseal involvement. Enttheseal means affecting the entheses, which are the places where tendons or ligaments attach to bones. In psoriatic arthropathy, the places where tendons or ligaments attach to bones can become painful and swollen.\nDactylitis. Dactylitis is inflammation of the entire digit (finger or toe), and it is a characteristic feature of psoriatic arthritis.\nNail pitting. Nail pitting is a change in the surface of the nail. It may be a sign of psoriatic arthropathy.\nTophi. Tophi are collections of inflammatory cells that can form under the skin. They are a characteristic feature of psoriatic arthropathy.\nThe absence of plaques of psoriasis excludes the diagnosis. Plaques are areas of raised, red skin with a scaly surface. The absence of plaques excludes the diagnosis of psoriasis. This means that if a patient does not have plaques, they do not have psoriasis.\nDiagnosis can be confirmed by a blood marker. A blood marker is a laboratory test that uses a sample of a patient's blood to help diagnose a disease. Doctors can use blood markers to confirm the diagnosis of psoriatic arthropathy."}

One result of this excess PTH is an increase in the concentration of calcium in the blood. Calcitonin is a hormone that has the opposite effect, decreasing the concentration of calcium in the blood. So, calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium.\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic.\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much PTH. One result of this excess PTH is an increase in the concentration of calcium in the blood. In most cases, primary hyperparathyroidism does not cause symptoms.\nVitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands.\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that promotes the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus. It is secreted by the skin after exposure to sunlight.\nOliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\nHypercalcaemia is a condition in which the concentration of calcium in the blood is too high. One result of hypercalcaemia is an increase in the volume of urine produced. So, oliguria (a decrease in the volume of urine produced) is a symptom of hypercalcaemia."}

{"question": "The activity of creatine kinase is:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "increased when intracellular ADP rises."}, {"label": "B", "text": "increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9."}, {"label": "C", "text": "always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres."}, {"label": "D", "text": "increased after a period of endurance training."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Creatine kinase is an enzyme that helps to replenish ATP by transferring phosphate groups from ADP to creatine. This reaction requires the hydrolysis of ATP.\nThe activity of creatine kinase is increased when intracellular ADP rises. This means that the higher the level of ADP in the muscle, the more active creatine kinase will be. This, in turn, means that more ATP will be replenished.\nMuscle pH is not a factor in determining the activity of creatine kinase.\nCreatine kinase is always lower in Type II fibers than in Type I fibers. This means that creatine kinase in Type II fibers is less active than in Type I fibers.\nEndurance training can increase the activity of creatine kinase. This means that after a period of endurance training, the enzyme will be more active."}

These parameters may include the patient's level of consciousness, language abilities, cognitive function, and motor function.\nOne of the main purposes of neurological observation is to monitor changes in a patient's condition. Some of the parameters that are often seen on typical neurological observation charts include level of consciousness, body temperature, and blood pressure.\nA patient's level of consciousness is often assistant. LECTURE: A patient's level of consciousness can be a useful indicator of the severity of a neurological problem. The two main types of consciousness are cognitive and sensorimotor.\nCognitive function includes a patient's ability to think, reason, and understand. Sensorimotor function includes a patient's ability to respond to sensory stimuli and to move.\nA patient's level of consciousness can be described in terms of the patient's ability to open their eyes, follow objects, respond to verbal commands, and move. For example, a patient who is unable to open their eyes or follow objects has a lower level of consciousness than a patient who can do these things.\nDoctors and nurses use a neurological observation chart to keep track of a patient's level of consciousness. These charts typically show the patient's name, the date, and the times of day at which various observations were made. They also show the patient's level of consciousness at each time.\nA neurological observation chart might have the following types of boxes:\nAlert: The patient is awake and able to answer questions and follow commands.\nSOLUTION: Central venous pressure is a measure of the pressure in the right atrium of the heart. This parameter is often measured in patients who are in intensive care units.

It is caused by high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow-green pigment that is produced when red blood cells are broken down.\nThe liver plays a central role in jaundice. It is responsible for processing and eliminating bilirubin from the blood. If the liver is damaged or diseased, it may not be able to eliminate bilirubin properly. As a result, bilirubin levels in the blood may rise, leading to jaundice.\nPale stools and dark urine are characteristic of the jaundice of heamolytic anaemia. This type of jaundice is caused by the breakdown of red blood cells. The breakdown of red blood cells releases bilirubin into the blood.\nBilirubin is used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells. This is not a true statement. Bilirubin is not used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells.\nItching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice is a type of jaundice that occurs when there is a blockage in the bile ducts. The bile ducts carry bile from the liver to the small intestine. If the bile ducts are blocked, bile may back up into the liver. The backup of bile can cause itching.\nPutting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is optional. This statement is true. Jaundice is not an infection."}

Glycolysis does not require oxygen.\nCreatine phosphorylation involves the rapid breakdown of creatine to produce phosphocreatine, which donates a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. This process occurs in muscle cells and does not require oxygen.\nPhosphocreatine stores refer to the reserve of phosphocreatine in muscle cells. Phosphocreatine can donate a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. This process occurs in muscle cells and does not require oxygen.\nATP stores refer to the reserve of ATP in muscle cells. When ATP is used to phosphorylate creatine to form phosphocreatine, ATP is converted to PCr. This process occurs in muscle cells and does not require oxygen.\nWhen muscles need to generate a lot of force quickly, they can use anaerobic metabolism to produce energy. Anaerobic metabolism can produce energy without using oxygen. However, anaerobic metabolism does not produce energy as efficiently as aerobic metabolism. As a result, the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds is from phosphocreatine stores."}

When blood flow increases, the pulse becomes stronger. And when blood flow decreases, the pulse becomes weaker.\nPulsations in the neck are usually arterial. This means that these pulsations are caused by the flow of blood through the arteries in your neck.\nSOLUTION: A waggling earlobe is a sign of arterial disease.\nWhen you exercise, your body needs more oxygen. So, your heart beats faster, and more blood is flowing through your arteries. This can cause a waggling earlobe.\nIf you have hepatojugular reflux, blood flows backward from the jugular vein into the hepatic veins. This can cause a pulsing in the neck.\nThis pulsing is called a liver pulse. A liver pulse is a sign of hepatojugular reflux.\nPosture affects the pressure in your arteries. When you change position, the pressure in your arteries can change. But the direction of the change is not important.\nWhat is important is that the pressure in the root of the neck reduces the impulse. This means that when the pressure in your arteries in the neck decreases, the strength of the pulse becomes weaker."}

In this process, the acid is broken down into 16 molecules of acetyl-CoA.\nThe first step in beta-oxidation is the removal of the two carbon atoms from the acid. This is done by removing the two hydrogen atoms from the two carbon atoms and adding a double bond between them. The resulting molecule is called an alkyl chain.\nThe alkyl chain is then cleaved into 16 pieces, each with two carbon atoms. Each piece is then converted to acetyl-CoA.\nThe acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation is used in the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, to produce ATP.\nSOLUTION: Beta-oxidation of palmitic acid does not involve oxygen.

It produces fewer ATP molecules per molecule of glucose than glycolysis does.\nHowever, during intense exercise, the demand for ATP can exceed the capacity of the body's oxygen supply. In this case, the body may begin to rely on anaerobic metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, to produce ATP.\nWhile fermentation can produce ATP more rapidly than aerobic metabolism, it also produces more metabolic waste.\nThe breakdown of phosphocreatine produces three ATP per molecule of phosphocreatine. However, this breakdown occurs primarily in muscles, and so it does not contribute significantly to the rapid resynthesis of ATP during exercise.\nGlycogenolysis can also produce a rapid increase in ATP. When glycogen is broken down, it produces glucose, which can then be converted to ATP through glycolysis.\nGlycolysis produces two ATP per molecule of glucose. It is the preferred pathway for producing ATP during exercise."}

Here are some ways that hormones can affect water balance:\nA. They can increase or decrease the amount of water in the blood.\nB. They can increase or decrease the amount of water in the kidneys.\nC. They can increase or decrease the amount of water in the intestines.\nSOLUTION: Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is primarily responsible for regulating fluid balance. ADH is produced by the posterior pituitary gland. It helps to increase the permeability of the collecting ducts in the kidneys, allowing water to be reabsorbed into the blood. This helps to increase the amount of water in the blood.\nInsulin is not primarily responsible for regulating fluid balance. Insulin is produced by the pancreas and helps to regulate blood sugar levels. It does this by decreasing the permeability of the collecting ducts in the kidneys, which decreases the amount of water that is reabsorbed into the blood.\nAdrenaline is not primarily responsible for regulating fluid balance. Adrenaline is produced by the adrenal gland and helps to increase heart rate and blood pressure. It does this by increasing the permeability of the collecting ducts in the kidneys, which decreases the amount of water that is reabsorbed into the blood.\nTestosterone is not primarily responsible for regulating fluid balance.

{"question": "Phophocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise is inhibited by:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "an excess of creatine."}, {"label": "B", "text": "hyperventilation."}, {"label": "C", "text": "an excess of oxygen."}, {"label": "D", "text": "a lack of oxygen."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Creatine is an energy source for muscles. Muscles use creatine phosphate to produce energy for immediate use. This energy is used to perform a short, intense task, such as lifting a weight.\nAfter a short-term high-intensity task, such as sprinting or lifting a weight, the body needs to resynthesize creatine phosphate to replenish its energy source. This resynthesis happens during the recovery period.\nDuring recovery, phosphocreatine is returned to creatine. This allows the creatine to be used again for energy. This process requires oxygen.\nOxygen is needed to convert the phosphocreatine back to creatine. If oxygen is in excess, the recovery process is not inhibited. If oxygen is lacking, the recovery process is inhibited.\nSOLUTION: A lack of oxygen would inhibit the recovery process. During exercise, oxygen is needed to convert phosphocreatine back to creatine. If oxygen is lacking, the recovery process is inhibited.\nAn excess of oxygen is not important to this process. An excess of oxygen does not affect the recovery process.\nAn excess of creatine does not affect the recovery process. An excess of creatine does not affect the levels of creatine or phosphocreatine.\nHyperventilation can decrease the levels of carbon dioxide in the body. This can change the acidity of the body. This change can inhibit the recovery process."}
{"question": "The transcription of DNA to a molecule of messenger RNA occurs:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "on the ribosomes."}, {"label": "B", "text": "in the cytosol."}, {"label": "C", "text": "in the nucleus."}, {"label": "D", "text": "only during cell division."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In cells, DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA) on the ribosomes.\nThe nucleus of an animal cell is the location of the cell's DNA. Only after a cell's DNA has been transcribed to mRNA can the mRNA leave the nucleus. In the cytosol, or the liquid inside the cell, the mRNA is translated to protein.\nThe ribosomes are the cells' factories for making proteins. Every ribosome is made of two long pieces of protein. One of the pieces is called a large subunit, and the other is called a small subunit.\nMessenger RNA is made of RNA. It is created by copying a portion of a cell's DNA. When messenger RNA is created, it is transported out of the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytosol.\nMessenger RNA is always created and used in the cytosol.\nWhen messenger RNA is created, it is bound to a molecule called a signal recognition particle (SRP). The SRP and the messenger RNA move to the ribosomes.\nThe SRP and the messenger RNA move together to the ribosomes. The SRP helps to position the messenger RNA on the ribosome.\nThe small subunit of the ribosome is made of RNA and protein. The small subunit of the ribosome has a binding site for messenger RNA. When the SRP releases the messenger RNA, it moves to the binding site on the small subunit of the ribosome.\nThe large subunit of the ribosome is made of protein. It has an active site, where the protein being translated is made. The large subunit also has a binding site for transfer RNA.\nWhen the messenger RNA is in the correct position, the ribosome can begin to translate it to a protein. This translation occurs in the active site.\nThe process of translation begins when a transfer RNA binds to the ribosome in the large subunit. The transfer RNA is carrying an amino acid. The amino acid is moved to the active site and attached to the growing protein chain.\nThe ribosome can then move along the messenger RNA, adding more amino acids in the correct order to the growing protein chain. When the ribosome reaches the end of the messenger RNA, the protein chain is finished.\nThe protein is released from the ribosome. It can then be used in the cell.\nSOLUTION: The transcription of DNA to a molecule of messenger RNA occurs in the nucleus."}
{"question": "Oedema is the presence of:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "excessive intravascular fluid."}, {"label": "B", "text": "excessive extravascular fluid."}, {"label": "C", "text": "excessive intracranial fluid."}, {"label": "D", "text": "excessive necrotic cells."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The fluid compartments of the body include the intravascular, interstitial, and intracapillary spaces.\nThe volume of fluid in the intravascular space is determined by the size of the blood vessels. When more fluid leaves the vasculature than enters it, oedema occurs. Oedema can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the legs.\nWhen oedema occurs, it is important to determine whether the excess fluid is in the intravascular space or in the interstitial space. This can be done by measuring the fluid pressure in the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. If the fluid pressure is normal, then the excess fluid is in the interstitial space. If the fluid pressure is elevated, then the excess fluid is in the intravascular space.\nSOLUTION: Oedema is the presence of excessive fluid. The fluid can be in the intravascular space, the interstitial space, or the intracranial space. Necrotic cells are dead cells. Necrosis is the death of cells. Necrotic cells do not leave the body as easily as other cells. So, excessive necrotic cells are not a common cause of oedema."}

It is important to use the inhaler quickly after taking a breath in.\nFirst, ask the patient to put the inhaler in their mouth. Then, they should take a large breath in, filling up their lungs. After taking a breath in, the patient should use the inhaler as quickly as possible. Finally, they should exhale slowly.\nBy taking a large breath in and using the inhaler quickly, more of the drug will reach the lower airways. Holding the breath or breathing normally after using the inhaler can cause the drug to go to the upper airways, which is less effective. Performing the procedure as quickly as possible is also important."}
{"question": "Why should a patient stand or sit as upright as possible when recording a peak flow rate?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "To ensure best lung expansion and accuracy and consistency of readings."}, {"label": "B", "text": "This is the most comfortable position to perform any breathing test."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The counter on the meter will not move if the patient is lying down."}, {"label": "D", "text": "To ensure that their technique can be observed easily."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The peak flow rate is a measure of how well the lungs are working. Standing or sitting as upright as possible helps to expand the lungs to their fullest. When the lungs are fully expanded, they can produce a higher peak flow rate.
