These messages are sent through the corticospinal tract, a set of nerve fibers that connect the primary motor cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord.\nThe corticospinal tract is made up of fibers that cross over (cross-corsover) to the opposite side of the brain. This cross-corsover happens in the brainstem.\nSo, when the primary motor cortex is active, it sends messages to the opposite side of the body. For example, when the left primary motor cortex is active, it sends messages to the right side of the body. And when the right primary motor cortex is active, it sends messages to the left side of the body.\nThis is why bilateral contraction of limb musculature is the correct answer. The primary motor cortex activity results in contraction of both the ipsilateral and contralateral limb musculature.\nIpsilateral refers to the same side of the body. So, contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature means that the muscles on the same side of the body as the active primary motor cortex will contract.\nContralateral refers to the opposite side of the body. So, contraction of contralateral limb musculature means that the muscles on the opposite side of the body as the active primary motor cortex will contract."}

Infections in the head and neck can include mouth infections.\nLooking at the patient's medical history, you can see that they have a history of mouth infections. So, it is important to examine the mouth.\nThe upper central incisor and the lower first molar are teeth. They are not in the head and neck. So, the patient's submandibular lymph nodes can be enlarged for reasons other than a mouth infection if the lymph nodes are near these teeth."}

This is because the recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates both the cricothyroid muscle and the interarytenoid muscles. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve affects the cricothyroid muscle but not the interarytenoid muscles.\nThe cricothyroid muscle is responsible for elevating the vocal folds. When the recurrent laryngeal nerve is damaged, the cricothyroid muscle remains functional but the vocal folds do not move much.

When the eye is exposed to a bright light, the oculomotor nerve carries this information to the brain, causing the brain to trigger the pupillary light reflex.\nThe efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is carried in the oculomotor nerve.\nThe oculomotor nerve carries instructions from the brain to the eye. When the brain triggers the pupillary light reflex, the oculomotor nerve carries the instructions to dilate the pupil.\nThe inferior colliculi in the midbrain do not mediate the pupillary light reflex.\nThe inferior colliculi are part of the brainstem and are involved in processing sensory information, including visual information. However, they do not mediate the pupillary light reflex.\nThe pupillary light reflex is a consensual reflex.\nA consensual reflex is one in which the response is under the control of the brain. The pupillary light reflex is a consensual reflex because the response is triggered by a sensory stimulus, but the amount of pupil dilation is under the control of the brain."}

They conduct air to the trachea.\nThe trachea is a tube that leads to the larynx. The larynx is the top of the windpipe. It contains the vocal cords.\nThe larynx leads to the bronchi. The bronchi are two branches, one for each lung. The bronchi lead to the bronchioles.\nThe bronchioles are small tubes that lead to the alveoli. The alveoli are where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place.\nThe alveoli are surrounded by capillaries. The capillaries are small blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood.\nSOLUTION: The alveoli allow for gas exchange in the lungs.\nThe alveoli are the structures in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. When air reaches the alveoli, oxygen passes from the air into the blood through the capillary walls. Carbon dioxide, a waste product, passes from the blood into the air.\nThe bronchi and bronchioles lead to the alveoli.
