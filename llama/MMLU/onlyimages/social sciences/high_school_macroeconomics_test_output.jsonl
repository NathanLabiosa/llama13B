Such a policy leads to an increase in aggregate demand.\nSuppose that an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level. This means that the economy's aggregate output increased, but the increase in output was not large enough to cause a rise in the general price level.\nSo, from the increase in real output and the small increase in the price level, it can be inferred that aggregate supply decreased."}

When the price level rises, real GDP and the trade deficit both decrease. When the price level falls, real GDP and the trade deficit both increase.\nSOLUTION: When both short-run aggregate supply and aggregate demand increase, the price level rises. But whether real GDP also rises depends on whether the increase in the price level leads to an increase or a decrease in real GDP.\nThe decrease in real GDP occurs because the rise in the price level makes exports more expensive and imports less expensive. This increases the trade deficit, which decreases real GDP.\nThe increase in real GDP occurs because the rise in the price level increases aggregate demand, which increases real GDP.\nThe change in the price level and the change in real GDP are not necessarily equal. So, the change in real GDP is uncertain."}

The two values are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\nThe current account is a measure of a country's trade in goods, services, and investments with the rest of the world. A negative current account means that a country is spending more on foreign goods, services, and investments than it is earning from its exports, investments, and other forms of income from the rest of the world.\nOne way a country can pay for its negative current account is by borrowing from the rest of the world. This borrowing will increase the magnitude of the capital account, but it will also increase the magnitude of the liabilities section of the balance of payments.\nA country depreciates its currency when it wants to make its exports cheaper and its imports more expensive. This will increase the magnitude of the current account. But a depreciated currency also makes the country's debt to foreigners more expensive to service. This could lead to higher interest rates and a higher cost of borrowing.\nA country appreciates its currency when it wants to make its exports more expensive and its imports cheaper. This will decrease the magnitude of the current account. But an appreciated currency also makes a country's exports more expensive. This could lead to a decrease in exports and a decrease in the magnitude of the current account."}

This can lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate.\nThe effect of a depreciation of the exchange rate on net exports depends on the price elasticity of demand for the country's exports. If demand for the country's exports is price inelastic, then an increase in the price of the currency will increase net exports. However, if demand for the country's exports is price elastic, then an increase in the price of the currency will decrease net exports.\nIn the short run, a decrease in net exports will decrease aggregate demand, which can cause the economy to decrease. In the long run, the decrease in net exports will lead to a decrease in the trade balance, which will decrease national savings and increase the current account deficit."}

A higher reserve ratio means that banks are holding a larger proportion of their deposits in reserve.\nThe reserve ratio is important because it can affect the money supply. Banks can increase the money supply by lending out some of their deposits. But if the reserve ratio is high, banks will hold onto more of their deposits as reserve, which will decrease the amount of money they have available to lend.\nSOLUTION: The reserve ratio is given by the formula:\nreserve ratio = excess reserves / deposits\nExcess reserves increased by $700, while deposits increased by $1000.

It can decrease the money supply to reduce spending.\nSOLUTION: Automatic stabilizers are government policies that do not require Congress to take any action. These policies can help the economy return to its full employment level.\nIf the economy is in a recession, unemployment insurance and food stamps are examples of automatic stabilizers. These policies provide a safety net for people who have lost their jobs. As a result, people have more money to spend, which can help stimulate the economy.\nIf the economy is in an boom, income taxes and social security taxes are examples of automatic stabilizers. As the economy grows, people earn more money. Higher incomes can result in higher tax payments. This can help reduce the risk of inflation."}

The government can use fiscal policies to help address problems in the economy.\nOne type of fiscal policy is a change in taxes. A tax is a fee paid by people and businesses. A decrease in taxes puts more money into the hands of people and businesses. This increase in spending can help stimulate the economy. An increase in taxes can decrease spending. This decrease in spending can help control inflation.\nAnother type of fiscal policy is a change in government spending. An increase in spending by the government can increase demand for goods and services. This increase in demand can lead to higher prices.

They can be positive or negative.\nA negative supply shock is a situation in which the supply curve shifts to the left. This means that the cost of producing goods and services increases. As a result, the quantity of goods and services that firms are willing to supply decreases.\nSome examples of negative supply shocks include natural disasters, which can damage infrastructure and decrease the availability of inputs; an increase in the price of inputs, which can increase the cost of production; and a decrease in the availability of certain inputs, such as labor or capital.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the money supply does not necessarily shift the short-run supply curve. It affects the interest rate and the exchange rate, but it does not affect the cost of producing goods and services. So, an increase in the money supply is not a negative supply shock.\nUnexpectedly higher resource prices are a negative supply shock. When the price of resources increases, the cost of producing goods and services increases. This can decrease the quantity of goods and services that firms are willing to supply.\nA decrease in the real interest rate is not a negative supply shock. The real interest rate is a measure of the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation. A decrease in the real interest rate does not affect the cost of producing goods and services. So, a decrease in the real interest rate is not a negative supply shock.\nA decrease in government spending is a negative supply shock. When government spending decreases, it decreases the demand for goods and services. This can decrease the quantity of goods and services that firms are willing to supply."}

Keynes argued that during a recession, people would hoard money rather than spend it, which would cause the economy to decline. To get the economy out of a recession, Keynes argued that the government should spend money on public works projects or cut taxes.\nKeynes's theory was a departure from the classical theory of employment. In the classical theory, economists believed that markets would always tend toward equilibrium. Keynes, on the other hand, argued that markets could get stuck in a cycle of underemployment, and that government intervention was necessary to break this cycle."}

Productivity can be defined as the amount of output per hour of work.\nThere are many policies that can affect productivity. Some policies are more likely to increase productivity in the long run than others.\nOne important factor is whether a policy allows for the efficient use of resources. Efficient use of resources means using resources in ways that make the greatest amount of output possible.\nImposing tariffs to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, placing taxes on savings, and increasing government spending are all policies that can reduce the efficient use of resources. These policies can also lead to retaliation from other countries, which can reduce trade and harm economic growth.\nEducation is an important input for productivity. Education can help to make people more productive by giving them the knowledge and skills they need to do their work.\nHowever, the relationship between education and productivity is not as strong as the relationship between productivity and the efficient use of resources.

The money supply can include currency (paper bills and coins) and also deposits that are available for spending in banks.\nThe central bank of a country is responsible for managing the money supply. In the United States, the Federal Reserve (the FED) is the central bank.\nOne way the FED can decrease the money supply is by selling government securities in the secondary market. When the FED sells securities, it receives payment from the buyers. That payment reduces the money supply.\nAnother way the FED can decrease the money supply is by raising the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the FED. When the discount rate is higher, banks can earn a higher return by borrowing from each other instead of from the FED. This can reduce the amount of money that banks borrow from the FED, which can decrease the money supply.\nA decrease in the money supply can lead to a decrease in economic activity. When there is less money in circulation, people and businesses may have less money to spend. This can cause prices to decrease, which is known as deflation.

It is downward-sloping, which means that if the price level rises, the quantity of goods and services demanded falls.\nWhen prices rise, consumers have to spend a larger percentage of their budget on basic necessities. So, they will demand fewer luxury goods.\nSimilarly, if prices rise, firms will demand fewer goods and services, because they have to pay more for inputs.\nThe shift of the aggregate demand curve shows how the quantity of goods and services demanded changes in response to a change in the price level, while keeping the price level fixed. If the price level rises, the quantity of goods and services demanded falls, and the curve shifts left. If the price level falls, the quantity of goods and services demanded rises, and the curve shifts right.\nSOLUTION: To close an expansionary gap, the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left.

For example, if an investor borrows $1,000 with a 5% fixed interest rate for 10 years, the investor will pay back $1,050 at the end of the 10 years. If the price level rises by 25%, the investor will need to pay back $1,275 at the end of the 10 years to maintain the same purchasing power. The rise in the price level affects the investor's repayment ability.\nA rise in the price level affects people with fixed money incomes. A fixed money income is less valuable when prices are rising. For example, if a person earns $50,000 per year and the price level rises by 25%, the person will need to earn $62,500 to maintain the same purchasing power.\nA rise in the price level does not affect investors in gems coins and stamps. This is because the price of gems coins and stamps is based on supply and demand for the specific item, rather than general price level changes.\nA rise in the price level affects property owners. When the price level rises, the price of properties also rises. This can make it harder for people to buy homes.\nSOLUTION: A rise in the price level raises the price of goods and services. This can make it more difficult for people with fixed money incomes to buy the same quantity of goods and services. So, people with fixed money incomes will suffer the most from a rising price level."}

The higher the discount rate, the less likely banks are to borrow money. So, a higher discount rate will decrease the money supply.\nThe reserve requirement is the minimum amount of money that banks must hold in reserve. The higher the reserve requirement, the less money banks can lend. So, a higher reserve requirement will decrease the money supply.\nSelling bonds does not affect the money supply. When the Federal Reserve sells bonds, it receives money from the buyer. The Federal Reserve then uses this money for open market operations to increase the money supply.\nBuying bonds affects the money supply. When the Federal Reserve buys bonds, it pays money to the bond seller. The Federal Reserve then uses this money for open market operations to increase the money supply."}

The demand for a product is affected by its price.\nWhen the price of a product increases, the quantity of the product that consumers are willing to buy decreases. So, the demand for the product decreases.\nWhen the price of a product increases, but the price of a substitute good decreases, the demand for the product may not change. This is because the change in price of the substitute good puts the demand for the substitute good back to where it was before.\nSOLUTION: If people expect the price of a particular product to increase in the near future, they will buy the product sooner, rather than later. This will decrease the demand for the product."}

For example, if consumption increases by 10 percent, the spending multiplier is 2, and GDP increases by 20 percent.\nThe value of the spending multiplier can be less than 1. This means that the change in GDP is less than the change in consumption. When the spending multiplier is less than 1, the effect of an increase in aggregate demand is lessened.\nSOLUTION: A constant price level is one indication that the spending multiplier is less than 1. A price level that is constant with an increase in aggregate demand is a price level that is higher than the level that would have prevailed with no increase in demand. This means that the increase in demand is not large enough to offset the decrease in supply. So, the change in GDP is less than the change in demand."}

In the money market, people can invest their money by buying financial assets, such as Treasury bills or certificates of deposit.\nThe demand for money is the quantity of money that people want to hold. This demand is called downward sloping, which means that as the quantity of money rises, the demand for money falls.\nOne important determinant of the demand for money is the interest rate. When the interest rate is high, people are willing to hold more money. This is because the high interest rate makes other financial assets more attractive compared to money.\nSOLUTION:If the money supply increases and money demand is downward sloping, the interest rate will fall. This effect of an increase in the money supply is called the crowding-out effect. The crowding-out effect happens because the increase in the money supply leads to a decrease in the demand for money.\nWhen the demand for money falls, the interest rate will fall. This means that the nominal interest rate does not change, and the real interest rate may fall."}

The GDP is unaffected by such a sale.\nThe GDP is a measure of the value of all the goods and services produced by an economy. An increase in GDP is usually the result of an increase in production. When an economy produces more goods and services, the GDP increases.\nAn increase in GDP can occur when an economy produces more goods and services. But it can also occur when an economy spends more on goods and services. In either case, GDP increases.\nAn increase in GDP is different from an increase in GI. An increase in GI reflects an increase in income. But an increase in GI does not always lead to an increase in GDP.\nAn increase in GI could lead to an increase in GDP.

In financial markets, money is used to buy and sell financial assets. The price of financial assets is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the financial market.\nSOLUTION: In a financial market, the demand for money is determined by the asset demand for money. When the demand for financial assets increases, the asset demand for money falls.\nSo, when demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls.

Further increases in aggregate demand will result in a higher price level and may also create inflation.\nHowever, the relationship between aggregate demand and price is not always a straight line. In particular, the short-run aggregate supply curve is not necessarily horizontal. The short-run aggregate supply curve is a curve that shows the relationship between the price level and the level of output in the short run.\nIn the short run, firms are willing to produce more goods and services when the price level is higher. This is because the higher price level increases the revenue that firms receive for their products. So, if the price level increases, the short-run aggregate supply curve will shift to the right.\nHowever, the short-run aggregate supply curve is also affected by the availability of inputs. If input prices increase, the short-run aggregate supply curve will shift to the left.\nTherefore, the short-run aggregate supply curve is not necessarily horizontal. It may be affected by changes in input prices, as well as by changes in the price level.\nSOLUTION: The statement \"Further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation\" is incorrect.\nAccording to the Phillips curve, inflation and unemployment are negatively related. This means that further increases in aggregate demand will lower the unemployment rate.\nThis does not mean that further increases in aggregate demand will not create inflation. It means that further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate because of the inflation that is created."}

This happens because foreigners are not sure that the nation will be able to repay its debts. To protect themselves, foreigners may choose to invest in other nations. When they do, they sell the nation's currency, which causes the value of the currency to decrease."}

{"question": "According to Classical analysis an economy in a recession can return to full employment through", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "falling wages and prices."}, {"label": "B", "text": "rising wages and prices."}, {"label": "C", "text": "expansionary monetary policy."}, {"label": "D", "text": "increased government spending."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Classical economists believed that a recession could be self-correcting. They argued that a recession could lead to a rise in unemployment, which would cause wages to fall and prices to decrease. As wages and prices fell, production costs would decrease, making it more profitable for firms to increase their production. This increase in production would lead to an increase in employment and, in turn, to further increases in production. At some point, the increase in employment would lead to a decrease in the unemployment rate."}
{"question": "One strategy a corporation may use to gain market share in a foreign market is", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "raising the price of its product."}, {"label": "B", "text": "convincing its government to put an import tariff on the product."}, {"label": "C", "text": "convincing its government to place a quota on the product."}, {"label": "D", "text": "dumping."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: For a corporation to gain market share, it must sell more products. It can do this by lowering the price of its product to make it more attractive to customers. Or, it may be able to increase sales by convincing its government to place a quota or tariff on the product. A quota is a limit on the number of products that can be imported. A tariff is a tax on imported products. Both a quota and a tariff can make a corporation's product more competitive in a foreign market.\nDumping is a pricing strategy. Dumping occurs when a corporation sells a product in a foreign market for less than it sells the same product in its own market. Dumping can help a corporation gain market share. But, if dumping hurts competitors in the foreign market, those competitors may appeal to their government for help. The government may investigate whether the dumping is unfair. If the government finds that the dumping is unfair, it may take action to stop the dumping."}

The real GDP per capita is a measure of the average amount of goods and services produced per person in a country.\nAn increase in real GDP per capita over time indicates that the country's average level of living has increased. This increase might be due to growth in output, or it might be due to inflation.\nSOLUTION: The real GDP per capita increased from $20,000 in 1980 to $21,000 in 1990. This means that the average amount of goods and services produced per person increased by $1,000.\nTo determine if this increase indicates that the standard of living increased, you need to consider whether the increase in real GDP per capita was due to inflation or to growth in output.\nOne way to do this is to compare the increase in real GDP per capita to the increase in inflation. If the increase in real GDP per capita is greater than the increase in inflation, then the increase in real GDP per capita is due to growth in output. If the increase in real GDP per capita is less than the increase in inflation, then the increase in real GDP per capita is due to inflation.\nYou can use the following formula to calculate the inflation rate:\ninflation rate = (current year price level / previous year price level) ^ (1 / number of years) - 1\nAccording to this formula, the inflation rate from 1980 to 1990 was 0.5 percentage points.\nSo, the increase in real GDP per capita was due to growth in output. The standard of living increased."}

This increase in demand can lead to an increase in prices. This is called inflation.\nThe real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation. A decrease in the real interest rate will increase investment.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the money supply leads to an increase in demand for goods and services.

This can make it hard to save for the future.\nHousehold incomes generally do not rise with prices.\nOver the past few decades, household incomes have not risen as quickly as prices. This means that it has been easier to get a loan, but harder to afford the monthly payments once you have a loan.\nThe economy could run out of money.\nIf prices keep rising, the economy could start to run out of money. This is because people will start to spend all of their money, and then prices will start to rise faster than incomes.\nBorrowers have to repay loans with more dollars.\nWhen prices are rising, borrowers have to repay loans with more dollars.

It is a measure of the economy's response to a change in government spending.\nWhen the velocity of money decreases, people tend to hold onto their money instead of spending it. This means that the same amount of money is used to buy more goods and services, which increases the demand for those goods and services. As a result, national income increases, and the spending multiplier is greater than 1.\nAn increase in the marginal propensity to consume does increase the spending multiplier, but it does not do so as much as a decrease in the velocity of money.\nAn increase in the marginal propensity to save does decrease the spending multiplier. When people save more of their income, they spend less on goods and services, which decreases the demand for those goods and services. As a result, national income decreases, and the spending multiplier is less than 1.\nAn increase in the real interest rate does decrease the spending multiplier. When the interest rate is increased, it becomes more expensive for people to borrow money. This tends to decrease the demand for goods and services, which decreases national income and the spending multiplier."}

One way to do this is to reduce taxes on investment. This reduction in taxes on investment increases the after-tax cost of investment, which leads to an increase in investment.\nAnother way to increase private investment is to accompany an increase in government spending with an increase in government purchases of goods and services from the private sector. This leads to an increase in private sector output and employment, which in turn leads to an increase in private investment.\nAlternatively, expansionary fiscal policy can be accompanied by expansionary monetary policy. Expansionary monetary policy increases the money supply and lowers interest rates. This leads to an increase in investment.\nContractionary monetary policy can also crowd out private investment. Contractionary monetary policy increases the interest rate and decreases the money supply. This leads to a decrease in investment.\nSOLUTION: To reduce or eliminate crowding out, expansionary fiscal policy can be accompanied by an increase in private investment. An increase in government spending can accompany an increase in private investment. So, an increase in government spending can reduce or eliminate crowding out."}

To increase aggregate demand, the government can use expansionary fiscal policy, which involves running a deficit and increasing government spending.\nWhen the government runs a deficit, it spends more than it takes in through taxes. This additional spending goes into the pockets of households and businesses, increasing their demand for goods and services.\nIncreased taxes and government spending will also increase aggregate demand. When the government spends more on goods and services, that money goes into the pockets of households and businesses. And when the government collects more taxes, it has more money to spend on goods and services.\nDecreased government spending and taxes will decrease aggregate demand. When the government spends less on goods and services, that money is not circulating in the economy. And when the government collects less taxes, it has less money to spend on goods and services.\nA surplus occurs when the government takes in more money than it spends. This means that the government is not spending all of the money in the economy. So, a surplus calls for the federal government to run a deficit."}

III. the balanced budget amendment.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "I only"}, {"label": "B", "text": "II only"}, {"label": "C", "text": "II and III"}, {"label": "D", "text": "I and II"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Crowding out occurs when the government increases spending so much that it drives up interest rates. Higher interest rates reduce private investment, which can offset the intended stimulative effects of fiscal policy.\nRational expectations is the idea that people will adjust their expectations to take into account the government's policy actions. If people believe that a fiscal stimulus will be followed by higher taxes in the future to pay for the additional debt, they will not increase their spending as much as the government intends.\nThe balanced budget amendment would make it difficult for the government to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy during a recession. If the government could not run deficits, it would be unable to increase spending to stimulate the economy."}

In this case, the tariff is on steel.\nA protective tariff on imported steel will increase the price that domestic consumers pay for steel. This will decrease the quantity of steel that domestic consumers buy. So, net exports of steel will fall.\nA protective tariff on imported steel will increase the price that domestic producers of steel pay for raw steel. This will increase the price of domestic steel. So, the tariff will increase the price of steel to domestic consumers.\nA tariff can also decrease the quantity of steel that foreign producers sell to domestic consumers. So, the tariff will decrease the income of foreign steel producers.\nA tariff can increase the price that domestic steel producers charge for their steel. So, the tariff will increase the income of domestic steel producers.\nAn allocatively efficient outcome occurs when goods and services are produced and consumed in the amounts that optimize social welfare. A tariff can help to optimize social welfare by reducing trade in inefficiently produced goods. In this case, the tariff can shift resources to more efficient domestic steel production."}

They believe that policies that increase the cost of production will decrease the supply of goods and services and lead to lower economic growth.\nLower taxes on household income are more likely to be preferred by supply-side economists because they can increase the after-tax income of households, which can lead to an increase in the supply of labor. An increase in the supply of labor can increase the supply of goods and services and lead to economic growth.\nA tax credit on capital investment is a policy that directly affects the cost of production. It can decrease the cost of production and increase the supply of goods and services, which can lead to economic growth.\nHigher tariffs on imported goods are more likely to be preferred by demand-side economists because they can increase the price of goods and services, which can decrease the demand for them. This can lead to a decrease in the supply of goods and services and economic growth.\nIncreased government spending can increase the demand for goods and services.

It was named after French economist Jean-Baptiste Say, who argued that supply creates its own demand.\nAccording to Say's Law, products will sell if they are produced. In other words, demand will rise to meet supply. This means that there is no need to worry about a lack of demand leading to a economic downturn.\nHowever, some economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, have criticized Say's Law. They argue that during a recession, a lack of demand can lead to a downward spiral in which people lose their jobs and cannot buy goods and services. In this case, demand does not rise to meet supply. To break out of this spiral, some economic stimulus is needed, such as government spending or tax cuts.\nSOLUTION: The principle that states that demand creates its own supply is a basis of Classical economic analysis. According to this view, economic downturns are not caused by a lack of demand, but by a lack of supply. The answer is B."}

The curve is shaped by the nation's production function and the quantities of its inputs.\nA nation is producing at a point inside of its production possibility curve. This means that the nation is producing fewer goods than it could if it used its highest-level technology and all of its inputs. There are many possible explanations for this outcome, including the choices:\nA. A permanent decrease in a nation's production capacity would move its production possibility curve to a lower level. This would make it impossible for the nation to produce as many goods as it could before the decrease in capacity.\nB. Slower than usual technological progress would move the production possibility curve slower than usual. This would mean that the nation is producing fewer goods than it could have before, but the decrease is smaller than it would have been in the absence of progress.\nC. Free trade between nations allows each nation to specialize in the production of goods in which it has a comparative advantage. This specialization can increase the overall production of goods. But if a nation avoids free trade, it may produce fewer goods than it could have before.\nD. An economic recession is a decrease in a nation's output of goods and services.

The higher interest rates can make it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow, which reduces their spending. This decrease in spending may cause the economy to slow down.\nIf the Federal Reserve is concerned about the crowding-out effect, it could engage in an expansionary monetary policy, which can lower interest rates and stimulate spending. One way the Federal Reserve can do this is by lowering the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Federal Reserve. Lowering the discount rate can reduce the cost of borrowing for banks, which can encourage them to lend more money to businesses and consumers. This increase in lending can stimulate spending, and this may help prevent the crowding-out effect from occurring."}

The Keynesian analysis of the economy focuses on the relationships among the money supply, the price level, and output.\nWhen the money supply decreases, the price level and output also decrease. This is called the crowding-out effect.\nThe crowding-out effect occurs because the decrease in the money supply causes interest rates to increase. As a result, businesses are less likely to invest in new projects, and consumers are less likely to buy new goods and services. Both of these things lead to a decrease in output and a decrease in the price level.\nSOLUTION: A decrease in the money supply affects the price level and output in the economy. So, a decrease in the money supply would lower the price level and output in the economy."}

This means that 100 yen is equal to one dollar.\nThe price of a Big Mac is a function of the exchange rates and the country in which the Big Mac is sold. For example, the price of a Big Mac in America is 3 dollars. But if the exchange rate is 100 yen to the dollar, then 3 dollars is equal to 300 yen.\nSOLUTION: The price of a Big Mac is most expensive in China. To see why, compare the price of a Big Mac in China to the price in the other countries.\nThe exchange rate is 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar. So, 200 yuan is equal to 2 dollars.\nThe price of a Big Mac in China is 200 yuan. To convert 200 yuan to dollars, divide 200 yuan by 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar.\n200 yuan / 100 per dollar = 2 dollars.\nSo, a Big Mac is 2 dollars in China.\nThe price of a Big Mac in America is 3 dollars.\nSo, a Big Mac is more expensive in China than in America."}

This can lead to less investment by private firms, which can decrease employment.\nTo reduce the crowding-out effect, the central bank can buy government securities. This increases the demand for securities and drives up their price, which lowers their interest rate. This makes it cheaper for the government to borrow, which should increase public investment and reduce the crowding-out effect.\nBuying government securities risks a recessionary gap. A recessionary gap is an economic situation where aggregate demand is less than aggregate supply. Buying government securities can increase the demand for securities so much that it drives interest rates below the equilibrium interest rate. This can lead to a recessionary gap."}

For example, if a company moves a factory from the United States to Brazil, the GDP of the United States will decrease, and the GDP of Brazil will increase.\nWhether a country's GDP increases or decreases depends on whether its trade balance is positive or negative. A positive trade balance means that a country is earning more from its exports than it is spending on its imports. This will increase the country's GDP. A negative trade balance means that a country is spending more on its imports than it is earning from its exports. This will decrease the country's GDP.\nSOLUTION: When a firm moves a manufacturing plant from the United States to Brazil, the United States will earn less from its exports than before, which will decrease the U.S. GDP. Brazil, on the other hand, will earn more from its exports than before, which will increase the Brazilian GDP."}

However, there are several potential drawbacks to using fiscal policy:\nOne potential drawback is that the increased government spending or lower taxes could lead to an increase in the budget deficit. This could happen if the stimulus provided by the fiscal policy is not enough to offset the negative effects of the recession on tax revenue. In this case, the government may have to raise taxes or cut spending on other programs to finance the budget deficit.\nAnother potential drawback is that the increased government spending or lower taxes could lead to inflation. This could happen if the stimulus provided by the fiscal policy overheats the economy and causes demand to exceed supply. In this case, the equilibrium price level could rise, and inflation could occur.\nA third potential drawback is that the increased government spending or lower taxes could have an effect on the exchange rate. This could happen if the stimulus provided by the fiscal policy leads to an increase in imports. In this case, the increased demand for foreign goods could lead to a decrease in the value of the domestic currency.\nA fourth potential drawback is that the increased government spending or lower taxes could have an effect on the natural environment. This could happen if the stimulus provided by the fiscal policy leads to an increase in pollution. In this case, the increased demand for goods and services could lead to an increase in pollution."}

These factors include the size of the labor force, the amount of capital per worker, and the productivity of both.\nImmigration affects the size of the labor force, and therefore affects long-run aggregate supply. But immigration affects the long-run aggregate supply curve in the opposite way that it affects the short-run aggregate supply curve. In the short-run, an increase in the labor force shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right. In the long-run, the increase in the labor force shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.\nResearch that improves the productivity of labor and capital affects the productivity of both. This increase in productivity can increase the size of the long-run aggregate supply curve.\nA nation that devotes more resources to nondurable consumption goods rather than durable capital goods affects the size of the long-run aggregate supply curve. The size of the long-run aggregate supply curve increases if a nation devotes more resources to nondurable consumption goods, which are produced by a higher skilled part of the workforce.\nMore restrictive trade policies reduce the size of the long-run aggregate supply curve. This reduction in the size of the long-run aggregate supply curve occurs because more restrictive trade policies reduce the amount of capital per worker."}

When the value of money decreases, people tend to spend more on goods and services, which increases the demand for goods and services. This increase in demand for goods and services shifts the aggregate demand curve outward, reducing the price level.\nSOLUTION: The price level increases as a result of an increase in the value of cash. The value of cash increases when interest rates increase. When the value of cash increases, people are more likely to hold on to their cash, which decreases the demand for goods and services.

These inputs include both labor and capital.\nIncreasing the quantity and quality of capital is particularly important in promoting faster rates of economic growth. This can include both domestic investment and international investment.\nResearch on clean energy sources can increase the quantity and quality of capital by increasing the availability of new technologies. This can lead to higher productivity and lower clean energy costs.\nHigher taxes on households and firms can reduce the incentive to produce, which can reduce output and employment.\nNegative net investment means that investment is lower than saving, which means that the economy is not increasing its capital stock. This can reduce the economy's potential output and can also reduce employment.\nA more restrictive immigration policy can reduce the quantity of labor available, which can decrease output and employment."}

A higher budget deficit means that the government is spending more money than it is taking in through taxes.\nThe multiplier effect is the effect of a change in government spending or taxes on other parts of the economy. The multiplier is a measure of how much the initial change in government spending or taxes is \"multiplied\" by other parts of the economy.\nThe expansionary multiplier is the multiplier for an expansionary fiscal policy, which increases the budget deficit. The contractionary multiplier is the multiplier for a contractionary fiscal policy, which decreases the budget deficit.\nSOLUTION: The government is increasing its spending and taxes by the same amount. So, the expansionary multiplier is 1.\nThe tax multiplier is 3. For every $1 of taxes, the multiplier is 3, so a $4 increase in taxes will result in a $12 decrease in national income.\nThe spending multiplier is -3. For every $1 of spending, the multiplier is -3, so a $4 increase in spending will result in a $12 increase in national income.\nSince the tax multiplier is greater than the spending multiplier, a $4 increase in taxes will have a larger negative effect on national income than a $4 increase in spending.

This decrease in investment can lower real GDP.\nOn the other hand, the increase in spending can increase the demand for goods and services, which can increase real GDP. So, the effect of the government's decision on real GDP is uncertain.\nHowever, an increase in the budget deficit can lead to an increase in the price level.

It is designed to stimulate the economy and reduce the severity of a recession.\nFiscal policy can affect the economy in a number of ways, including interest rates and inflation. However, the primary way it affects the economy is by altering aggregate demand.\nWhen the government spends more money or cuts taxes, it increases the amount of money in the economy. This increase in the money supply stimulates demand, and, as a result, output and employment increase.\nThe main goal of expansionary fiscal policy is to eliminate a recessionary gap. A recessionary gap is a decrease in output below what the economy can produce in the long run. It occurs when aggregate demand falls below aggregate supply.\nOne of the ways a recessionary gap can occur is when inflation is low and unemployment is high. In this case, the government can increase its spending and/or decrease taxes to stimulate demand. This will increase output and employment and help close the recessionary gap."}

What causes that decline in economic activity? Each of the factors helps to explain the decline in the macroeconomy.\nUnemployment: When firms lay off workers, those workers have less income to spend. This decrease in spending can cause other firms to lay off workers, and the unemployment rate can increase.\nBankruptcy: When firms are unable to pay their debts, they may go bankrupt. Bankruptcy can cause workers to lose their jobs and can lead to a decrease in output and income.\nDeclining labor productivity: In a recession, the productivity of labor decreases. This means that it takes more labor to produce a given level of output.

So, a change in aggregate demand can create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips Curve.\nAn increase in output that corresponds with a decrease in the price level does not create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips Curve.\nA rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve would create a trade-off between inflation and unemployment.\nAn increase in input costs that corresponds with an increase in unemployment does not create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips Curve.\nInput costs that increase may cause companies to raise prices, which can lead to higher inflation. But the increase in input costs does not directly affect unemployment.\nA rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve can create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips Curve.\nA rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve means that the economy is producing more goods and services than it was before. This increase in output corresponds with a decrease in the price level. But the decrease in the price level does not ensure that unemployment will decrease."}

This increase in spending shifts the aggregate demand curve to a higher level, leading to an increase in the equilibrium price level and an increase in the equilibrium quantity of output.\nThe increase in consumer confidence may also increase businesses' optimism. This increase in optimism could lead businesses to increase their investment in capital and labor, which in turn increases the aggregate supply curve. The increase in the aggregate supply curve results in an increase in the equilibrium quantity of output and a decrease in the equilibrium price level.\nSOLUTION: When consumer confidence increases, households are likely to increase their spending. This increase in spending shifts the aggregate demand curve to a higher level, leading to an increase in the equilibrium price level and an increase in the equilibrium quantity of output.\nBecause the increase in consumer confidence leads to an increase in the equilibrium price level and an increase in the equilibrium quantity of output, the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output increase."}

This can come from an increase in the population (more people to work), an increase in the education level of the population (more skilled workers), or an increase in the nation's capital stock (more equipment).\nA decline in the birth rate, by itself, will eventually decrease the population. So, it is not a good choice to increase a nation's productive capacity.\nDeclining adult literacy rates, by themselves, will not affect a nation's productive capacity. So, it is not a good choice to increase a nation's productive capacity.\nWidespread relocation of manufacturing firms to low-wage nations can increase a nation's productive capacity. This is because the firms can take advantage of lower wages in the low-wage nations to increase their profits.

In other words, inflation reduces the value of each dollar, so that more dollars are needed to buy the same goods and services.\nWhen inflation occurs, people have to pay more for goods and services than they did before. This means that, in general, people have less purchasing power than they did before. For example, if inflation raises the price of food, consumers will have to spend more on food. So, they will have less money left to spend on other things.\nInflation can also affect the economy in other ways, such as by causing businesses to reduce production or investment. This can lead to a recession, which is a situation of decreasing economic activity.\nSOLUTION: Inflation can redistribute wealth by making some people better off and others worse off. But wealth redistribution is not a major cost of inflation.\nRedistribution of wealth can occur when inflation raises the prices of assets, such as stocks and real estate. When prices rise, the people who own those assets may see an increase in their wealth. But this redistribution is not a cost of inflation. It is a result of inflation.\nSavings will be discouraged if people expect to earn a return that is less than the rate of inflation. But savings are not directly affected by inflation. Instead, the value of savings can change as inflation affects interest rates and the prices of goods and services.\nReal incomes will fall when the price level rises. But real incomes can also fall due to a decrease in the number of jobs or an increase in taxes. So, falling real incomes are a result of inflation, not a major cost of it.\nThe misallocation of resources can occur when prices and wages do not reflect the true opportunity cost of producing goods and services. But this misallocation is not a major cost of inflation. It is a result of inflation."}

When unemployment is high, the supply of labor is low, and labor is an important input in the production of most goods and services. So, an increase in unemployment could cause a decrease in long-run aggregate supply.\nAn increase in the real interest rate may increase long-run aggregate supply. An increase in the real interest rate makes borrowing and investing more attractive, which could lead to increased investment in capital and higher long-run aggregate supply.\nIncreased investment in capital may increase long-run aggregate supply. When firms invest in capital, they increase their ability to produce goods and services. So, increased investment in capital could increase long-run aggregate supply.\nAn increase in aggregate demand is unlikely to increase long-run aggregate supply. In the long run, aggregate supply is determined by the available resources and the real interest rate. An increase in aggregate demand does not change the available resources or the real interest rate, so it is unlikely to increase long-run aggregate supply."}

The consumption function can be used to predict how much households will spend in any given period.\nThe marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a key parameter in the consumption function. It represents the proportion of an increase in income that is consumed rather than saved.\nThe MPC is important because it determines the slope of the consumption function. A higher MPC means that, for a given income increase, consumption will increase by a larger amount. This means that the consumption function has a higher slope.\nSOLUTION: An increase in optimism about the future would increase the MPC. This means that, for a given income increase, households would consume more. So, the slope of the consumption function would increase.\nThe entire consumption function would not shift upward or downward. The consumption function reflects intertemporal choices.

It shows that when unemployment is low, inflation is high, and when unemployment is high, inflation is low. The curve is named after A. W. Phillips, the economist who first observed this relationship in 1958.\nThe position of the Phillips curve is sensitive to changes in expectations. If people expect prices to rise more quickly in the future, the Phillips curve will shift to the left. This means that a given level of unemployment will be associated with a higher rate of inflation in the future than it was in the past.\nConversely, if people expect prices to rise more slowly in the future, the Phillips curve will shift to the right. This means that a given level of unemployment will be associated with a lower rate of inflation in the future than it was in the past.\nSOLUTION: Expectations of higher future inflation can move the Phillips curve to the right. This means that the same level of unemployment will be associated with a lower rate of inflation in the future.\nIf prices are expected to rise more slowly in the future, this expectation becomes reality if the actual rate of inflation does decrease.

And an increase in government spending will also increase the aggregate demand.\nSOLUTION: To determine which of the following would increase the aggregate demand function, you need to figure out which part of the equation is being increased.\nLower levels of consumer wealth would decrease the aggregate demand. So, lower levels of consumer wealth would decrease the aggregate demand function.\nA higher real interest rate would increase the aggregate demand for goods and services. So, a higher real interest rate would increase the aggregate demand function.\nLower taxes on personal income would increase the disposable income of consumers. This increase in disposable income would increase consumer spending, which would increase the aggregate demand. So, lower taxes on personal income would increase the aggregate demand function.\nHigher levels of imported goods would increase the aggregate demand for foreign goods. So, higher levels of imported goods would increase the aggregate demand function."}

This is because a lower demand for the country's goods and services means that fewer people are willing to hold the country's currency.\nThe speculation that the peso will increase in value will shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the right. This is because people are more willing to hold a currency that is expected to increase in value.\nAn increase in interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries will not shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the left. This is because interest rates affect the demand for a currency by influencing the interest rates that people can earn on deposits in that currency. An increase in interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries will actually increase the demand for the Mexican peso.\nA lower rate of inflation in Mexico relative to other countries will not shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the left. This is because the inflation rate affects the expected future value of a currency. A lower inflation rate in Mexico relative to other countries will actually increase the demand for the Mexican peso."}

When the government has a budget surplus, it means that it is collecting more money in taxes than it is spending on programs. One way the government can use this surplus is to pay down part of its national debt.\nSOLUTION: Paying down part of the national debt with a budget surplus has two potential effects on the economy.\nFirst, by decreasing the national debt, this policy may decrease the amount of interest the government pays. This could lower interest rates and stimulate borrowing and spending by businesses and individuals, which could lead to an increase in economic activity and potentially reduce unemployment.\nSecond, by decreasing the national debt, this policy may decrease the demand for bonds. This could decrease bond prices and increase interest rates. This could also decrease the value of the nation's currency.\nHowever, decreasing the national debt with a budget surplus could also have a negative effect on the economy. If the government pays down the debt too quickly, it may decrease spending too much and too quickly. This could lead to a decrease in economic activity and potentially increase unemployment."}

The Federal Reserve can affect the money supply by changing the reserve ratio, or the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve.\nWhen the reserve ratio is lower, banks have more money to lend. This increases the money supply and reduces interest rates.\nWhen the reserve ratio is higher, banks must hold more money in reserve. This decreases the money supply and increases interest rates.\nThe discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Federal Reserve. When the discount rate is lower, it is cheaper for banks to borrow money. This increases the money supply and reduces interest rates.\nWhen the discount rate is higher, it is more expensive for banks to borrow money. This decreases the money supply and increases interest rates.\nTaxes and government spending affect the government's role in the economy. When the government increases taxes on household income, it reduces the amount of money that households have to spend. This can decrease economic activity and lead to a decrease in the money supply.\nSOLUTION: An increase in taxes on household income, and a decrease in the money supply, are both examples of contractionary monetary policy. So, the effect of the Fed increasing taxes on household income is to decrease the money supply.\nThe sale of Treasury securities to commercial banks is an example of the Fed's open market policies. This action affects the money supply by changing the amount of money that banks have to lend. This action does not affect the reserve ratio or the discount rate. So, the effect of the Fed selling Treasury securities to commercial banks is not to decrease the money supply.\nA lower reserve ratio and a lower discount rate are examples of expansionary monetary policy. So, the effect of the Fed lowering the reserve ratio and the discount rate is to increase the money supply."}

The slope of the consumption function is called the marginal propensity to save (MPS).\nThe MPS tells you how much of a change in income is used to increase saving. For example, if the MPS is 0.2, then a $1,000 increase in income leads to a $200 increase in saving.\nThe marginal propensity to consume (MPC) tells you how much of a change in income is used to increase consumption. For example, if the MPC is 0.8, then a $1,000 increase in income leads to an $800 increase in consumption.\nThe slope of the consumption function is equal to the MPC + MPS.\nSo, the slope is equal to MPC + MPS."}

When people and businesses stop spending money, they stop investing as well. This causes the economy to spiral downward.\nWhen people receive income, a portion of it is used to consume goods and services. This is called the marginal propensity to consume. The marginal propensity to consume increases during a recession. So, a sharp rise in the marginal propensity to consume would occur during a recession.\nToo much investment can lead to an economic downturn. If companies invest too much, they may produce more goods than people are willing to buy. This can lead to a decrease in profits and layoffs.\nToo much foreign influence on the economy is not the cause of a decrease in spending."}

This type of policy tries to stimulate spending, investment, and output.\nOne effect of an expansionary monetary policy is to worsen the balance of trade. An improved balance of trade is a trade surplus, or a situation in which a country exports more than it imports. A worsened balance of trade is a trade deficit, or a situation in which a country imports more than it exports.\nSOLUTION: An expansionary monetary policy tends to worsen the balance of trade. First, the lower interest rates increase the demand for goods and services, which increases imports. So, imports go up.\nThen, the worsened trade deficit puts downward pressure on the value of the currency. When the value of the currency decreases, the prices of imports decrease, which increases the demand for imports. So, imports go up.\nAn expansionary monetary policy has no effect on exports. An expansionary monetary policy may increase output, which could lead to increased exports. But exports are a function of the volume of output and the prices at which the output is sold. An expansionary monetary policy increases output, but it also decreases the prices at which output is sold. So, exports may not increase.\nAn expansionary monetary policy has no effect on imports. An expansionary monetary policy may increase output, which could lead to increased imports. But imports are a function of the volume of output and the prices at which the output is sold. An expansionary monetary policy increases output, but it also decreases the prices at which output is sold.

A falling stock of capital goods reduces the country's ability to produce goods and services, which can lead to lower economic growth.\nMore rapid consumption of natural resources can also reduce a country's capital stock. This is because natural resources are used up in the production process.\nHigher adult illiteracy rates and investment tax credits are not likely to affect a country's economic growth.

The assumptions underlying monetarism include the following:\nthe money supply is continuous.\nthe velocity of money is stable.\nThe first two assumptions are prerequisites for the third assumption.\nAn important implication of the stability of the velocity of money is that the economy can move along a path of steady growth. This assumption is critical to the theory.\nIf the velocity of money were to change, the money supply could change independently of the level of national income. For example, if the velocity of money increased, the money supply would need to grow at a larger rate than national income to keep the money supply constant.\nIf the money supply were to grow at a larger rate than national income, the inflation rate would increase."}

One way to do this is by adding to the reserves of banks. When banks have more reserves, they can make more loans to customers. This increases the money supply and lowers interest rates.\nOne important factor that can limit the effectiveness of monetary policy is the behavior of people in the economy. If people respond to the increased money supply by changing their behavior, the impact of monetary policy on the economy may be reduced.\nOne potential way people may respond is by carrying very little cash and keeping most of their money in checking and saving deposits at banks. In this case, the increased money supply may not lead to an increase in demand for goods and services, as people are not holding more cash. This would reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nInvestment demand is not perfectly elastic. Although investors may be convinced to switch to alternative investments, the magnitude of the effect on the economy will be smaller than if money demand were perfectly elastic.\nMoney demand is nearly perfectly inelastic. This means that people are not likely to change their cash holdings in response to a change in the money supply. So, if money demand is nearly perfectly inelastic, the central bank's ability to conduct expansionary monetary policy will not be limited by the behavior of people in the economy.\nBanks make loans with all excess reserves. This means that an increase in reserves will always be followed by an increase in loans. This will increase the money supply and help lower interest rates. So, this will not limit the central bank's ability to conduct expansionary monetary policy."}

An expansionary monetary policy increases the money supply and lowers interest rates. When interest rates are low, businesses and consumers are more likely to borrow and spend, which increases aggregate demand.\nAn expansionary monetary policy can also increase the demand for money. As the demand for money increases, the interest rate will tend to increase. But if the demand for money is perfectly elastic, expansionary monetary policy might be quite effective. In this case, the central bank can increase the money supply to whatever level is needed to keep the interest rate at zero. At a zero interest rate, businesses and consumers will be more likely to borrow and spend, which increases aggregate demand.\nA contractionary monetary policy is the opposite of an expansionary policy. A contractionary policy decreases the money supply and raises interest rates. A contractionary policy can be effective in situations where the economy is overheating and inflation is a concern. But in a deep recession, a contractionary policy is not appropriate. A contractionary policy will tend to decrease aggregate demand, which can worsen the recession."}

These two actions can affect real GDP.\nAn increase in government spending on goods and services increases real GDP. So, if the government of country Z increases spending by $12 million dollars, real GDP will increase by more than $12 million dollars.\nA tax increase raises the amount of money the government collects from taxpayers. This increase in tax collections reduces real GDP. So, if the government of country Z raises tax collections by $12 million dollars, real GDP will decrease by $12 million dollars.\nSOLUTION: An increase in spending and a tax increase in the same country have opposite effects on real GDP. The increase in spending will increase real GDP, but the tax increase will decrease real GDP.

Real GDP can be increased by increasing the country's output of goods and services, which is called aggregate demand. One of the ways to increase aggregate demand is to increase government spending. Government spending increases the money supply by adding to the demand for goods and services. This increase in the money supply leads to an increase in aggregate demand and, in turn, to an increase in real GDP.\nAn increase in the real interest rate also increases aggregate demand and thereby increases real GDP. This happens because the higher interest rate increases the cost of borrowing money. So, businesses are less likely to borrow money to expand their operations. This reduces the demand for goods and services and leads to a decrease in real GDP.\nAn increase in taxes, however, decreases aggregate demand and thereby decreases real GDP. This happens because the increase in taxes takes money out of the hands of consumers and businesses. This decrease in spending decreases the demand for goods and services and leads to a decrease in real GDP.\nA decrease in net exports also decreases real GDP. Net exports are equal to exports minus imports. An increase in imports relative to exports decreases net exports and leads to a decrease in real GDP.\nSOLUTION: Increasing government spending increases aggregate demand and real GDP.\nAn increase in taxes decreases aggregate demand and real GDP.\nA decrease in net exports decreases real GDP."}

As a result, the quantity of output that sellers are willing to supply also increases, but the higher price reduces the quantity of output that buyers are willing to purchase. The result is that the equilibrium quantity of output increases, but the equilibrium price level also increases.\nA decrease in the equilibrium price level reduces the price of goods and services. As a result, the quantity of output that sellers are willing to supply decreases, but the lower price increases the quantity of output that buyers are willing to purchase. The result is that the equilibrium quantity of output decreases, but the equilibrium price level also decreases.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the equilibrium price level and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of output indicate that the decrease in aggregate supply outweighs the increase in aggregate demand. The major earthquake has destroyed much of the plant and equipment on the West Coast, which has increased the cost of production. This has shifted the aggregate supply curve to the left, decreasing the equilibrium quantity of output.

This means that firms are willing to supply less output at each price.\nWhen the price level falls, the aggregate supply curve will generally shift to the right. This means that firms are willing to supply more output at each price.\nThe amount of resources in the economy is one of the determinants of the aggregate supply curve. When there are more resources in the economy, the aggregate supply curve will generally shift to the right.

When inflation is too high, the federal government can run a budget deficit. This increases the demand for goods and services, which in turn increases the demand for labor. As a result, wages and prices will eventually decrease.\nWhen the federal government runs a deficit, it spends more money than it takes in as revenue. One way it can do this is by buying goods and services from private businesses. This increases the demand for those goods and services.\nAlternatively, the federal government can use increased taxes and government spending to decrease the inflation rate. This approach involves increasing taxes to decrease demand and government spending to decrease the amount of goods and services available.\nDecreased government spending and taxes will decrease the inflation rate. When the government spends less and taxes less, it decreases the demand for goods and services. This means that wages and prices will eventually decrease.\nA surplus is a budget deficit in which the government collects more money than it spends. Surpluses are not typically used to address inflation. A surplus could be used to pay off debt or to save for future spending.\nA deficit is a budget deficit in which the government spends more money than it takes in. Deficits can be used to remedy inflation. When the government spends more money than it takes in, it increases the demand for goods and services.

The money supply is then lent out by banks, leading to an increase in the velocity of money. This increase in the velocity of money leads to an increase in nominal GDP.\nHowever, if the public prefers to hold less cash, the money supply will not increase as much as it would have without this preference. So, the potential amount of money created by the Fed's increase in bank reserves will be diminished.\nIf depository institutions decide to hold more excess reserves, they will not lend out as much of the new reserves. This means that the increase in the money supply will be smaller than it would have been. So, the potential amount of money created by the Fed's increase in bank reserves will be diminished.\nThe marginal propensity to consume is a measure of how much one's consumption increases when one's income increases. If the marginal propensity to consume falls, then people are not spending as much of their income as they used to. This means that the increase in the money supply will be used to purchase fewer goods and services. So, the potential amount of money created by the Fed's increase in bank reserves will be diminished.\nThe velocity of money is a measure of the average number of times money is spent in a given period. A decrease in the velocity of money means that people are spending money less frequently. This means that the increase in the money supply will be used to purchase fewer goods and services. So, the potential amount of money created by the Fed's increase in bank reserves will be diminished."}

This increases the demand for funds and leads to an increase in interest rates.\nWhen interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing for private investment projects rises, which reduces the quantity of private investment. This reduction in private investment is crowding out.\nThere is relatively more crowding out when the investment demand curve is elastic. An elastic investment demand curve means that a change in interest rates has a larger effect on the quantity of investment. So, when interest rates rise due to expansionary fiscal policy, the quantity of private investment falls more.\nAn inelastic investment demand curve has the opposite effect. A change in interest rates has a smaller effect on the quantity of investment. So, when interest rates rise due to expansionary fiscal policy, the quantity of private investment falls less.\nGovernment spending improves profit expectations among businesses. This increase in profit expectations leads to an increase in private investment. So, crowding out is less of a concern when government spending improves profit expectations among businesses.\nExpansionary monetary policy accompanies the fiscal policy. This policy involves increasing the money supply. An increase in the money supply leads to an decrease in interest rates. So, the quantity of private investment is likely to increase, not decrease, when expansionary monetary policy accompanies expansionary fiscal policy."}

The production of goods and services is the primary source of a country's GDP. Some goods and services are produced for sale to customers, while others are produced for the use of the producing firm.\nCapital goods are goods that are used in the production of other goods and services. They are not produced for final consumption.\nSo, the purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm is an example of an investment in capital for a business. It is not a final purchase. The accounting firm will use the software to produce services that will be sold to customers. The software will not be consumed by the accounting firm.\nB. When a business spends money on capital goods, such as software, the business does not include the cost of the capital goods in its GDP. Only final goods and services are included in GDP.\nFinal goods and services are produced for consumption. They are not produced for investment.\nSo, the purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm is not included in the GDP.\nD. Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts is a final good. The baker will use the flour to make donuts that will be sold to customers. The baker will include the cost of the flour in his GDP.\nThe baker's GDP will increase by the cost of the flour, plus the value of the donuts that the baker produces with the flour.\nSOLUTION: The purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm is an investment in capital for the firm.

If either the supply curve or the demand curve shifts, the equilibrium price will change.\nSupply and demand can shift for a variety of reasons. One possible reason is a change in consumer tastes or preferences. This type of shift is shown in the figure below.\nNotice that the supply curve shifts to the right, and the demand curve shifts to the left. As a result, the equilibrium price increases, and the equilibrium quantity decreases.\nAnother reason for a shift in supply and demand is a change in production costs. A increase in production costs will shift the supply curve to the left, which will increase the equilibrium price. A decrease in production costs will shift the supply curve to the right, which will decrease the equilibrium price.\nThe figure below shows a supply shift and a demand shift due to a change in production costs. In this case, both supply and demand shift to the right. The equilibrium price increases, and the equilibrium quantity also increases.\nSOLUTION: Whether the equilibrium price increases or decreases depends on whether supply or demand is shifted.\nCorn is exchanged in a competitive market. So, either the supply curve or the demand curve will shift.\nIf both supply and demand shift, the equilibrium price will increase.\nIf both supply and demand shift to the right, the equilibrium price will increase.\nIf both supply and demand shift to the left, the equilibrium price will decrease.\nIf supply shifts to the right and demand shifts to the left, the equilibrium price will increase.\nIf supply shifts to the left and demand shifts to the right, the equilibrium price will decrease."}

{"question": "Which of the following is a tool used by the Fed to increase the money supply?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A lower discount rate."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A higher reserve ratio."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A lower personal income tax rate."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The Federal Reserve can use a variety of tools to increase the money supply. These tools include changing the discount rate, the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Fed; selling Treasury securities to commercial banks; and changing the reserve ratio, the ratio of reserves to deposits that banks are required to hold.\nAnother way the Federal Reserve can increase the money supply is by lowering personal income tax rates. This can leave people with more money to spend, which increases the demand for goods and services, and stimulates businesses to increase production. This increased production and economic activity can lead to an increase in the money supply.\nHowever, changing personal income tax rates is not an effective tool for controlling the money supply. Changes in tax rates do not have a predictable effect on the money supply. An increase in the tax rate, for example, would not necessarily lead to a decrease in the money supply.\nSOLUTION: A lower discount rate, a higher reserve ratio, and selling Treasury securities to commercial banks are tools used by the Fed to increase the money supply.\nA lower discount rate decreases the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Fed. This can encourage banks to borrow more money, which they can then use to make loans to other borrowers. This increase in the money supply can stimulate economic activity and increase employment.\nA higher reserve ratio increases the ratio of reserves to deposits that banks are required to hold. This decreases the amount of money that banks can lend. But by selling Treasury securities to commercial banks, the Fed can increase the reserves held by banks. This increases the money supply.\nSelling Treasury securities to commercial banks is one way the Fed can increase the money supply. This has the effect of increasing the reserves that banks hold."}

This means that the currency is more expensive.\nIf the exchange rate is lower, the prices of goods and services in international markets are lower than they would be if the exchange rate were higher. This means that the currency is less expensive.\nSOLUTION: The exchange rate tells you the value of the euro in terms of the U.S. dollar.\nThe exchange rate is $1.40/euro. This means that 1 euro is equal to $1.40.\nSo, the euro has appreciated. An appreciated currency is more expensive."}

A higher world price than the domestic price creates an incentive for U.S. producers to sell their copper on the world market rather than domestically.\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. Imposing a tariff on imported copper would make copper produced in other countries more expensive than copper produced domestically. This would reduce the incentive to export copper from the United States and would likely increase the demand for domestically produced copper.\nA tariff on imported copper would not necessarily decrease the demand for copper in the United States. The higher price of copper produced in the United States compared to copper produced in other countries would increase the demand for domestically produced copper.\nA growing trade deficit in the United States in goods and services would occur if the value of the goods and services the United States imports exceeds the value of the goods and services the United States exports. A tariff on imported copper would not necessarily reduce the trade deficit. The tariff would increase the price of copper produced in the United States, which could increase the demand for copper in the United States.

It tells you how inflation affects savings.\nInflation encourages households to save more. So, inflation increases savings in the economy."}
{"question": "Which of the following fiscal policy combinations would be most likely to slowly increase real GDP without putting tremendous upward pressure on the price level?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increase government spending with a matching decrease in taxes."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Decrease government spending with a matching increase in taxes."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increase government spending with no change in taxes."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increase taxes with a matching increase in government spending."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Fiscal policy involves the government's spending and tax policies. The government can change its spending and taxes to influence the economy.\nOne way fiscal policy can affect the economy is by changing aggregate demand. A increase in government spending will increase aggregate demand, while a decrease in government spending will decrease aggregate demand. At the same time, the government can change taxes to offset the effect of its spending on aggregate demand. For example, a decrease in government spending with a matching increase in taxes will have a smaller effect on aggregate demand than a decrease in government spending with no change in taxes.\nSOLUTION: To slowly increase real GDP without putting tremendous upward pressure on the price level, the government can increase its spending with a matching decrease in taxes. This combination will increase aggregate demand, which will lead to an increase in real GDP. The price level will not increase too much, as the decrease in taxes will help to offset the increase in demand."}

It is determined by the real interest rate and the expected investment spending.\nThe real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for expected changes in the price level. It affects the demand for loanable funds by influencing the costs of borrowing.\nInvestment spending affects the demand for loanable funds by influencing the demand for funds to finance capital projects.\nWhen the real interest rate is higher, the demand for loanable funds is higher. This happens because borrowers are willing to pay higher interest rates to get capital for their projects.\nWhen investment spending is higher, the demand for loanable funds is higher. This happens because firms need to borrow more funds to finance their capital projects.\nSo, an increase in the federal deficit may increase the demand for loanable funds, increase the real interest rate, and increase investment spending."}

If the reserve ratio is increased, the amount of excess reserves will increase.\nThe reserve ratio is the ratio of reserves to deposits. If the reserve ratio is increased, the amount of reserves that banks must hold relative to their deposits will increase. Banks will have to either increase their deposits or increase their reserves to meet the new reserve ratio. If they increase their deposits, this will increase the checking deposits. If they increase their reserves, this will increase the excess reserves.\nThe discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Fed. An increase in the discount rate will increase the cost of borrowing from the Fed, which will reduce the amount of excess reserves.\nThe Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks to reduce the amount of reserves in the banking system.

These curves are based on the principle of absolute advantage, which states that a nation has a absolute advantage in producing some goods over others.\nWhen nations specialize in producing goods in which they have an absolute advantage and trade with other nations, they can consume more goods and services than they produce. This is called a trade surplus.\nWhen a nation has a trade surplus, it is saving more than it is spending. This saving can be used to invest in new factories, equipment, and other capital. This investment can increase the nation's productivity and, in turn, its long-term ability to consume.\nFree trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve. This is possible because free trade allows nations to specialize in producing goods in which they have an absolute advantage and to trade with other nations.\nProtecting domestic industries from free trade can increase the cost of production for some goods. This can decrease the quantity of goods that a nation can produce and cause the nation to fall below its production possibility curve. This means that the nation cannot consume as many goods and services as it would like."}

So, the aggregate quantity of products demanded will decrease.\nWhen the price level is low, buyers are willing and able to purchase more goods. So, the aggregate quantity of products demanded will increase.\nIn an economy with a constant money supply, changes in the price level have the same effect as changes in interest rates. A higher price level means a lower interest rate, and a lower price level means a higher interest rate.\nSOLUTION: When the price level is such that the aggregate quantity of products demanded exceeds the aggregate quantity of products supplied, the economy is in disequilibrium. To restore equilibrium, the price level will be driven upward. This will increase the cost of production for firms, which will increase the quantity of products supplied. The increase in the quantity of products supplied will decrease the difference between the aggregate quantity of products demanded and the aggregate quantity of products supplied."}

So, an increase in the unemployment rate will not result in economic growth.\nThe labor force is the number of people in the population who are able to work. An increase in the size of the labor force can indicate that more people are able to work. This can be a sign of economic growth. So, an increase in the size of the labor force can result in economic growth.\nThe population is the number of people in a given area. A decrease in the population does not affect the labor force or the unemployment rate. So, a decrease in the population will not result in economic growth.\nAn increase in the unemployment rate can be a sign of economic contraction. But it is not a direct cause of economic contraction.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the size of the labor force can result in economic growth. This is because more people in the labor force means that there is a larger pool of workers, which can lead to increased productivity and higher economic growth."}

This means that the inflation rate shows how quickly the general price level of goods and services is increasing.\nWhen the inflation rate is higher, it indicates that prices are increasing at a faster rate. In other words, goods and services are more expensive than they were in the recent past.\nAn inflationary gap is a situation in which the inflation rate is higher than the target inflation rate. In other words, prices are increasing at a faster rate than the government wants.\nTo close an inflationary gap, the government can use a variety of policies. One type of policy is an increase in the money supply. This type of policy can help to decrease the inflation rate by making more money available for people to spend.\nAnother type of policy is a federal budget deficit. A budget deficit occurs when the government spends more money than it takes in through taxes. This can inject more money into the economy and decrease the inflation rate.\nA third type of policy is a decrease in the money supply. This can help to decrease the inflation rate by making less money available for people to spend.\nA fourth type of policy is to increase taxes. This can decrease the money available for people to spend, which can decrease the inflation rate.\nA fifth type of policy is to reduce government spending. When the government spends less money, this can decrease the inflation rate.\nSOLUTION: To close an inflationary gap, the government can use a combination of policies.

According to this theory, the FED should actively conduct monetary policy to achieve specific economic goals.\nIf the FED should allow the money supply to grow at a constant rate, it is following a policy of monetary expansion. This could shift the aggregate demand curve and have other effects on the economy.\nHowever, this policy could also lead to inflation if it outpaces the increase in real output."}
{"question": "Which function of money best defines $1.25 as the price of a 20-ounce bottle of pop?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Medium of exchange"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Unit of account"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Store of value"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Transfer of ownership"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The function of money is a way to describe how money is used. The four functions of money are:\n1. Medium of exchange: A medium of exchange is a way to trade things. Money is a medium of exchange.\n2. Unit of account: A unit of account is a way to describe the size of a transaction. The price of a hamburger is given in units of cents.\n3. Store of value: A store of value is a way to save money. Money can be saved in a bank or spent today.\n4. Transfer of ownership: A transfer of ownership is a way to move money from one person to another.\nSOLUTION: To define $1.25 as the price of a 20-ounce bottle of pop, we need to use the function of money as a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange is a way to trade things. So, $1.25 can be used to trade a 20-ounce bottle of pop."}

So, a policy that is supported by supply-side economists would be one that reduces taxes or increases incentives to invest.\nHigher taxes on corporate profits would decrease the after-tax profit of companies, which would decrease the incentive to invest. This policy would not increase the supply of goods and services and would not lead to an increase in employment or output.\nLower tax rates on interest earned from savings would increase the after-tax return on saving, which would increase the incentive to save and invest. This policy would increase the supply of capital, which would increase the supply of goods and services and lead to an increase in employment and output.\nRemoval of investment tax credits would decrease the after-tax return on investment, which would decrease the incentive to invest. This policy would decrease the supply of goods and services and would not lead to an increase in employment or output.\nA longer duration of unemployment benefits would increase the amount of time that people have to look for a job, which would increase the number of people looking for a job.

Recessions can be caused by many factors, but they often result from a decrease in aggregate demand.\nAggregate demand is the sum of the demands of all households and businesses in the economy. It shows the total amount of goods and services that firms in the economy expect to sell.\nWhen aggregate demand decreases, firms in the economy produce and sell fewer goods and services. This can lead to layoffs, which in turn can decrease aggregate demand further.\nTo close a recessionary gap, the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the right. This tells firms that they can expect to sell more goods and services in the future, which will increase their current production.\nSOLUTION: A recessionary gap is a gap between actual output and potential output. Potential output is the level of output that can be produced when the economy is operating at full capacity.\nTo close a recessionary gap, the economy needs to increase its actual output to match its potential output. This means that the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the right."}

When a country raises a tariff on goods from another country, the higher price of the imported goods lowers the quantity of the goods that are imported. This can raise the price of the imported goods in the domestic market.\nA quota is a limit on the quantity of imported goods. When a country sets a quota on goods from another country, the limit on the quantity of imported goods can raise the price of the imported goods in the domestic market.\nSOLUTION: Tariffs and quotas do not necessarily affect domestic prices. The main effect of a tariff or quota is to raise the price of the imported goods in the domestic market. However, the price of goods in an open economy is determined by the intersection of domestic supply and domestic demand. So, if the price of imported goods rises, the price of domestic goods may also rise to keep the overall price level the same."}
