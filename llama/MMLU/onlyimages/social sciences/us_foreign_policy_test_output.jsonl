The Cold War had both domestic and international implications for American exceptionalism.\nOn the one hand, the Cold War helped to enhance American exceptionalism. Many Americans saw the United States as the \"leader of the free world\" and as a beacon of democracy and freedom. The Cold War also led to an expansion of American power and influence globally.\nOn the other hand, the extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism. Some Americans began to question whether it was appropriate for the United States to act as the world's policeman.

Isolationism was a popular view in the 1930s, and many Americans, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, favored an isolationist stance for the United States.\nThere were several reasons why Roosevelt initially favored an isolationist stance. One reason was that he believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration in the United States. Roosevelt believed that the United States could solve its own problems at home and that it did not need to get involved in international affairs to do so.\nAnother reason was that Roosevelt believed that German domination of Europe would be in US interests. At this time, many people in the United States believed that Germany was the leading economic power in Europe, and that it would be in the United States' best interest for Germany to dominate the continent.\nA third reason was that Roosevelt always favored isolationism. While Roosevelt did not always support isolationism, he did believe that the United States should avoid involvement in international affairs whenever possible.\nA fourth reason was that Roosevelt believed that the United States should stay out of the war because it would be a distraction from the task of domestic reform. Roosevelt believed that the United States should focus on solving its own problems at home rather than getting involved in a foreign war."}

This lens shaped US perceptions of the Third World, as local developments were viewed in terms of their potential impact on the global balance of power.\nDecolonization, or the process of gaining independence from colonial empires, was seen as an important geopolitical development. The US generally supported decolonization, as it was viewed as an opportunity to spread democracy and capitalism.\nHowever, the US did not unreservedly support decolonization. For example, during the Cold War, the US supported the French in their attempt to hold on to their colonies in Indochina. The US also supported authoritarian regimes in countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, in order to block communist influence.\nThe US did not ignore the Third World, as it had important economic, military, and political ties with many countries in the Third World."}

{"question": "International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Irrationality on the part of the leadership"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Regime type"}, {"label": "D", "text": "International conflict prevents trade"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: International trade can benefit both countries involved, but some countries still try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market. This can occur through measures such as tariffs and import quotas.\nOne reason countries do this is because the costs of free trade are concentrated, but the benefits are dispersed. This means that the costs of a trade restriction, such as a tariff, are paid by a relatively small group of people, such as import-competing firms. The benefits of free trade, such as lower prices for consumers, are dispersed among a larger group of people. So, the people who pay the costs of a trade restriction may be different from, and outnumber, the people who receive the benefits.\nAnother reason is that regime type can affect a government's willingness to engage in international trade. Autocratic governments may be more likely to protect their country's firms from competition than democratic governments.\nIrrationality on the part of the leadership and international conflict preventing trade are not the main reasons why countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market."}

However, in general, the trade of oil and other natural resources has tended to benefit the governments and small groups of people in developing states at the expense of the broader population.\nSome developing states have used their natural resources to fund military efforts or to support policies that benefit the ruling regime. In these cases, the trade of oil and other natural resources has not democratized countries.\nThe trade of oil and other natural resources has also encouraged stability of the regime. When a country has a lot of oil, it has an incentive to maintain a stable regime because oil is a valuable resource that is difficult to protect and exploit if the regime is unstable. So, authoritarian regimes are more likely to maintain stability when they have oil.\nThe trade of oil and other natural resources has also changed the nature of the investor. In many developing states, the primary investors in oil and other natural resources are foreign companies. These companies are primarily interested in extracting and selling natural resources, rather than in promoting the long-term economic development of the country.\nFinally, the trade of oil and other natural resources has no real effect on the relationship between the government and the people. In many cases, the people in developing states are not able to participate in the trade of natural resources. As a result, the trade has not had a significant impact on the everyday lives of most people in these states."}

This quote suggests that war is like a game with rules.\nLike a game, war has a set of rules that govern how it is fought. The rules of war include the use of force to achieve military objectives, but they also include the idea that war should be a last resort.\nSOLUTION: The idea that war is the continuation of politics by other means helps to explain why wars start. Wars start when governments decide that the benefits of fighting a war are greater than the costs.\nOne of the reasons that governments may decide that the benefits of fighting a war are greater than the costs is that they see a chance to achieve a policy goal through war. For example, a government may decide that it is worth going to war to overthrow a dictator or to gain control of a particular resource."}

After 1865, the US government was expanding its markets, which included the establishment of trading relationships with other countries and the construction of infrastructure to support trade.\nThe key difference between US expansion pre- and post-1865 was that expansion was based on markets rather than territory after 1865."}

It has the power to propose laws, but it does not have the power to approve treaties or other international agreements. So, real power is not located in the Chamber of Deputies.\nThe Secretariat is the main administrative body of the United Nations. It carries out the day-to-day work of the United Nations, including organizing conferences and publishing reports.

{"question": "According to realists, what is the fundamental difference between the international system and the domestic system?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Armed conflict"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Anarchy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Institutions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No common language"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Realists argue that the fundamental difference between the international system and the domestic system is the absence of a central government in the international system. In the domestic system, a central government is in charge of regulating activities and enforcing laws. In the international system, there is no central government, and different states must find ways to cooperate and regulate themselves.\nInstitutions are one way that states can cooperate and regulate themselves in the international system. Institutions can include both formal organizations, such as the United Nations, and informal rules and practices.\nAnarchy is the absence of a central government. In the international system, anarchy means that there is no world government to enforce laws. Instead, states must cooperate and regulate themselves.\nArmed conflict is one potential outcome of anarchy. If states are unable to cooperate and resolve their differences through peaceful means, they may turn to armed conflict.\nA common language is not essential for international cooperation and regulation. States can communicate and cooperate with each other without a common language."}

However, identifying those states who already support human rights and constraining abusive leaders are not reasons why intergovernmental organizations are ineffective. These organizations have the ability to identify those states that already support human rights and can constrain abusive leaders. They can do this through the use of sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and other means."}

The \"Philadelphian System\" was designed as the antithesis of European politics. It proposed that America should avoid the political and religious conflicts that had torn Europe apart. This plan was put forth at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, which is where the system's name comes from.\nThe idea of American exceptionalism refers to the notion that the United States is qualitatively different from other countries. This idea has been associated with the belief that the United States has a unique role to play in world affairs."}

The war was fought between the communist North Vietnam and the anti-communist South Vietnam. The United States played a significant role in the war, sending troops to South Vietnam to prevent the spread of communism.\nThe war had many causes and effects, many of which are still debated today. One of the main causes of the war was the Cold War, a global conflict fought between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies. The United States and the Soviet Union were alarmed when their client states in South Vietnam and North Vietnam, respectively, formed governments that were hostile to them. The United States and South Vietnam saw the communist North Vietnamese as a threat to their security, and the Soviets saw the United States and South Vietnam as a threat to their security.\nThe United States involvement in the Vietnam War was part of its containment policy, a strategy to stop the spread of communism. But the war also revealed the limits of U.S. power and the global impact of the Cold War."}

The purpose of nuclear deterrence is to keep other states from attacking the United States or its allies. Deterrence can work by making it clear to other states that the United States is prepared to respond to an attack with overwhelming force.\nHaving the capability to deter smaller states is important to the United States because smaller states are more likely to attack the United States or its allies. Because smaller states are more likely to attack, they are more likely to be deterred by a U.S. nuclear capability.\nHaving the capability to deter the most powerful rival is important to the United States because powerful rivals are more likely to attack the United States or its allies. Because powerful rivals are more likely to attack, they are more likely to be deterred by a U.S. nuclear capability.\nHow nuclear attacks are identified and responded to; who controls the weapons is not specific to deterring smaller states or the most powerful rival. This answer does not provide information about how to deter smaller states or the most powerful rival.\nBureaucratic politics provides no information about nuclear proliferation and use. Bureaucratic politics is a type of politics that involves competition among groups within the government. This type of politics does not provide information about how to deter smaller states or the most powerful rival."}

This specialization and trade between countries can be helped by international agreements.\nInternational trade agreements are formal contracts between countries. These contracts can help trade by removing obstacles to trade, such as high tariffs.\nThere are many types of international trade agreements. Some agreements are between two countries. Others involve groups of countries. Some international trade agreements are limited to reducing tariffs. Others cover a wide range of trade-related issues.\nSOLUTION: Reciprocity is a mechanism used in international trade agreements. This means that countries agree to treat each other fairly.\nReputational concerns refer to the importance of being viewed as a good partner by other actors. This mechanism can be used in international trade agreements to encourage countries to follow through on their commitments.\nSide payments are payments that countries provide to other countries for following through on their commitments in international trade agreements. These payments are an example of a mechanism that involves paying countries to adjust to the organization."}

This idea has influenced American foreign policy and its approach to global economics.\nTariffs are taxes on imported goods. They can be used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. American exceptionalism might encourage the use of tariffs in order to protect domestic industries and promote economic growth.\nNationalization is the process of taking private property, such as a company, and transferring ownership to the government. American exceptionalism does not encourage nationalization. In fact, many people who support American exceptionalism believe that private property rights are essential to promoting economic growth and individual freedom.\nLiberalization of global trade refers to the elimination of barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas. Liberalization of global trade can promote economic growth by allowing countries to specialize in producing goods and services where they have a comparative advantage. American exceptionalism encourages liberalization of global trade.\nRedistribution of wealth refers to policies that transfer wealth from some individuals to others. American exceptionalism does not encourage the redistribution of wealth. In fact, many people who support American exceptionalism believe that the redistribution of wealth hinders economic growth and individual freedom."}

Isolationist strategies and internationalist strategies are two ways in which exceptionalism can influence American grand strategy.\nIsolationist strategies focus on the decline of the American power. They can be motivated by a belief that the United States is fundamentally different from other countries and that it needs to be protected from the harmful influence of other nations.\nInternationalist strategies focus on the role of the United States in the world. They can be motivated by a belief that the United States has a special responsibility to promote peace and prosperity throughout the world, in line with its exceptional role.\nBoth can be viewed as different means of achieving the same liberal ends. Liberalism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual freedom and equality. It has a tradition of advocating for internationalism, or a focus on the role of the United States in the world.

He used the example of the rise and fall of the British Empire to illustrate how a great power can decline. Kennedy did not argue that all of the world's leading economies were declining due to low growth and inflation. He did not argue that the soft power of the United States would allow it to avoid decline. Kennedy did not argue that the rise of Japan had been exaggerated. Instead, he argued that the United States could no longer remain a superpower and was in decline."}

To do this, the United States must avoid entering into alliances that could draw it into conflicts that are not in its interest. The United States should also invest in its own defense and not rely on other countries to defend it.\nMulti-polarity means that there are several powerful states in the world. To embrace multi-polarity for the purpose of offshore balancing, the United States would need to show greater restraint in its actions on the world stage. This would include requiring other states to meet their own security burdens.\nIsolationism is the opposite of offshore balancing. Isolationism seeks to remove the United States entirely from the international system. This would make it impossible for the United States to maintain a balance of power with other countries."}

The Marshall Plan was named after U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall and was enacted in 1948. It provided more than $12 billion in economic assistance to countries in Europe and is often cited as the first major step in the development of the European Union.\nThe Marshall Plan was not an attempt to diminish the potential attraction of the Soviet system to Europeans. It was not an aid program that embedded US influence in Europe. And, it was not designed to stimulate revolutions in other countries."}
{"question": "What accounted for the US avoidance of catastrophe at the hands of the British in 1814?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Naval victories"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Diplomacy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "British preoccupation with Europe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Britain had many reasons to undertake an invasion of the United States in 1814. Britain's victory in the Napoleonic Wars had left it as the world's dominant power, and its leaders felt that an invasion of the United States would be a good way to further cement their country's global power.\nMoreover, the war between the United States and Britain was going badly for the United States. The U.S. Navy had been defeated by the British Navy, and the British had fired Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital, in August 1814.\nHowever, the invasion was not to be. In September 1814, British troops captured and burned the city of Baltimore, Maryland. The British had hoped to exploit the success by launching an invasion of the United States, but they were unable to do so.\nThe reasons for the British failure to invade are complex and include diplomatic efforts to end the war, the need to prepare for a new war with France, and logistical challenges."}

This belief can lead to opposition to world government for several reasons:\nIt views world government as impractical: Some Americans believe that a world government is impractical or even impossible. They might argue that global cooperation is important, but that a world government would be too difficult to create or maintain.\nIt views the UN as a sufficient form of global governance: Some Americans might believe that the United Nations is the best and most appropriate form of global governance. They might argue that creating a world government would not be necessary or useful.\nIt general anti-statism opposes centralized government: Some Americans might oppose world government because they are generally opposed to centralized government. They might argue that a world government would be too centralized and would take away power from individual nations."}

They argue that material factors were not the only motivations for US involvement in the Cold War.\nIn contrast, Realist accounts of the same period place greater emphasis on material factors, such as economic interests and military power."}
{"question": "How did the relationship between President and Congress develop under George H.W.

The presidency grew stronger during the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\nThe chief reason for the growth of presidential power was the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore. The court's decision effectively gave the presidency greater control over the electoral process, which strengthened the office.\nThe second reason for the growth of presidential power was the September 11, 2001, attacks. In the aftermath of the attacks, the presidency was able to assume new powers and responsibilities, particularly in national security matters.\nThe third reason for the growth of presidential power was the development of a more professional and sophisticated array of tools to help the president raise funds, organize his staff, and manage the bureaucracy.\nCongress also gained power during the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. In particular, Congress asserted its primacy in foreign policy."}

{"question": "Historically, what has been the general pattern of defense spending in the United States?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Steady increases over time."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increased spending during wars, with demobilization bringing spending down but not back to prewar levels"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unpredictable fluctuations."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increased spending during wars, with further increases after the war to prepare for future engagements."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Steady increases over time. is the correct answer.\nThe United States has the world's largest defense budget. A trend in American history has been the steady increase of military spending over time. Since World War II, the United States has been involved in many wars and military conflicts, and during these times, defense spending has tended to increase. However, even in the periods between wars, defense spending has generally risen rather than fallen."}
{"question": "International development may be tied to the security of the state, why?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Threats to the state centralize political and economic power, threatening state development"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Too many casualties drain the productive power of the state"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Threats to the state encourage socialism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The two are correlated, but there is no causal effect"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: International development is tied to the security of the state because threats to the state centralize political and economic power, threatening state development.\nThreats to the state can include both external threats, such as invasion, and internal threats, such as civil war. In response to these threats, the state may centralize political and economic power in order to effectively respond to the threat. This centralization can include increased government regulation and control of the economy, as well as concentration of power in the hands of a few key leaders or institutions.\nWhile centralization of power may temporarily strengthen the state, it can also lead to reduced international development. Centralization can stifle innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as limit the flow of information and ideas. This can create a negative feedback loop, in which centralization slows growth, which in turn makes the state more vulnerable to future threats."}
{"question": "What was the 'Domino Theory'?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The idea that the Cold War operated according to the principles of game theory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The idea that certain states were of higher value than others to the US during the Cold War"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The idea that the fall of one state to communism would inexorably lead to the fall of its neighbors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The idea that the growth of democracy in one state would inexorably lead to its growth in others"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The Domino Theory was the idea that the fall of one state to communism would inexorably lead to the fall of its neighbors.\nThe Domino Theory was a central justification for the United States' extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The theory was first mentioned by President Eisenhower in 1954 and was a dominant theme of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations' explanations of the Vietnam War.\nThe Domino Theory is an application of the principle of contagion, or the notion that a state's internal characteristics will spread to its neighbors. This idea goes back to the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, who argued that the Peloponnesian War would spread throughout the ancient Greek world.\nThe Domino Theory has its limitations. It is questionable whether the fall of one state to communism would inevitably lead to the fall of its neighbors. In many cases, the reverse happened: the communist states were the ones that fell."}
{"question": "What has been an effective way of disbursing US foreign aid to encourage change in target states?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Conditional programs, such as the Millennium Challenge, that require change before receipt of aid"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the use of intergovernmental organizations to monitor aid disbursement"}, {"label": "C", "text": "withdrawal of aid for bad policies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above, international aid never works"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The United States has a long history of providing foreign aid to other countries. The effectiveness of foreign aid is a topic of much debate.\nOne effective way to disburse foreign aid is through conditional programs. These programs require the recipient country to demonstrate a certain level of good governance, such as fighting corruption, before receiving aid. The Millennium Challenge is an example of such a program.\nAnother effective way to disburse foreign aid is to use intergovernmental organizations to monitor aid disbursement. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are two examples of such organizations.\nWithdrawing aid for bad policies can also be effective. This policy is called conditionality. It can be effective in encouraging change, but it can also create resentment and reduce the incentive of the recipient country to make further reforms.\nFinally, it is important to recognize that foreign aid is just one tool for encouraging change in other countries. Its effectiveness is limited by the specific circumstances of each case."}
{"question": "What was established at Bretton Woods in 1994 to stabilize the global economy?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The US Dollar as the world's reserve currency"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The IMF was established at Bretton Woods in 1944, not 1994.\nThe US Dollar as the world's reserve currency was not established at Bretton Woods. It became the world's reserve currency after World War II.\nGATT was established in 1947, not at Bretton Woods.\nThe United Nations was established at Bretton Woods in 1994, not the IMF."}
{"question": "Which of the following is NOT a good predictor of which states will get nuclear weapons?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Wealth/GDP"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rivalry with a nuclear state"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Regime type"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Nuclear weapons are not used to attack states that are not nuclear powers. So, the prospect of receiving sensitive nuclear assistance, rivalry with a nuclear state, and regime type are all good predictors of which states will get nuclear weapons.\nWealth/GDP is not a good predictor. Nuclear weapons are expensive to develop and maintain. So, states with lower wealth/GDP are less likely to acquire nuclear weapons."}
{"question": "What was 'democratic enlargement'?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A proposal for reform of the US system of government"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A proposal for the extension of democratic rule globally"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A proposal for the extension of free markets"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both b and c"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Democracy is a form of government in which power is held by the people. This can include a wide range of institutions and practices, but certain features are central to any democratic system. These include free and fair elections, the rights of individuals to organize and participate in politics, and the rule of law.\nDemocratic enlargement refers to the extension of democratic rule globally. This includes efforts to promote democracy both within countries (for example, by supporting democratic transitions) and globally (for example, by advocating for democratic values and institutions).\nFree markets is an economic system in which prices and wages are set by the forces of supply and demand. This is in contrast to a planned economy, in which the government sets prices and wages."}
{"question": "What is meant by the phrase 'empire by invitation'?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Voluntary reliance on an external power for security"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Willful openness to colonization"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cultural imperialism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Open advocacy of imperialism for economic gain"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The phrase \"empire by invitation\" originated in the concept of the \"gentleman's agreement\" in the late 1800s. This was a voluntary reliance on an external power for security, and it was called a \"gentleman's agreement\" because it was agreed to by the elites, or gentlemen, of the country involved. This type of arrangement was often made in response to a threat to the country's sovereignty.\nThese agreements were often made with major powers such as the United States, Britain, or Japan. They were not always made publicly, and sometimes the country's people were not consulted."}
{"question": "In what way did the George W Bush administration change the direction of US foreign policy?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It criticized international organizations, rather than trying to strengthen them"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It expanded NATO to include former Soviet states"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It focused on a more personal style of leadership"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It increased international support for the United States"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The Bush administration changed the direction of US foreign policy in several ways. One of the key changes was a shift from multilateralism to unilateralism, which means moving away from working through international organizations and toward acting alone. This change is reflected in the criticism of international organizations rather than trying to strengthen them.\nThe expansion of NATO to include former Soviet states was another change in US foreign policy. This change represented a move toward strengthening international organizations.\nA more personal style of leadership refers to the Bush administration's emphasis on the \"war on terror\" and the use of a powerful, decisive leader as a symbol of American strength. This change in direction reflected a shift in focus from abstract concepts, such as spreading democracy, to a more personal, hands-on approach to foreign policy.\nIncreasing international support for the United States was a goal of the Bush administration. This change in direction reflects a focus on improving America's image abroad and gaining international support for its actions."}
