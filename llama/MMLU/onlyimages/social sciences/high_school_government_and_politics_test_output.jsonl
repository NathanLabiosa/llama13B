The president's chief of staff is the person who is in charge of the president's schedule and who has control over which messages and pieces of information the president sees.\nAnother key factor is the person who is in charge of making national security decisions. In the United States, the national security advisor is in charge of making national security decisions.\nThe Federal Reserve Board chair is in charge of the country's central bank. While the chair of the Federal Reserve Board is an important executive branch official, the chair's role in controlling access to the president is less significant than the roles played by the president's chief of staff and the national security advisor.\nThe vice president's office is separate from the executive office of the president. The vice president does not have a formal role in the executive branch.\nSOLUTION: The president's chief of staff controls the flow of information and messages to the president. The chair of the Federal Reserve Board does not control the flow of information and messages to the president. So, the chair of the Federal Reserve Board does not have the ability to control the amount of access cabinet secretaries have to the president.\nThe national security advisor is in charge of making national security decisions and is in charge of controlling the flow of information related to national security. So, the national security advisor has the ability to control the amount of access cabinet secretaries have to the president.\nThe vice president's office is separate from the executive office of the president.

The authors of The Federalist Papers believed that a government that allows for a degree of political decentralization is better able to manage the dangers of factionalism.\nFactions can form among individuals, groups, or political parties. When factions form within a state government, they can have a degree of influence on government policy. But if the same factions form within the national government, they can dominate the government and have a powerful influence on national policy.\nBy establishing a federal government, the framers of the Constitution intended to create a central government that would be strong enough to manage international and economic policy, but not so strong that it could dominate the governments of the states. This would allow state governments to manage many local policies and to serve as a laboratory for policy innovations.\nAt the same time, the framers of the Constitution established a system of checks and balances that would limit the power of each branch of the federal government. This would make it more difficult for any one faction to dominate the government."}

Labor unions have a long history of organizing workers to fight for better wages, working conditions, and benefits, and many unions actively encourage their members to vote. In fact, unions often use their resources to get out the vote among their members.\nVoters aged 18-29 are likely to vote. This is the age group that is most likely to vote in any election, including midterm elections.\nVoters who are active in their political parties are likely to vote. Political parties often have enthusiastic supporters who are willing to volunteer, campaign, and vote for their party's candidates.\nProfessionals are unlikely to vote. Professional associations, which are made up of people who work in a particular profession, are typically not as active in politics as labor unions or political parties. Many professionals are focused on their careers and may be less interested in politics."}

The question asks about the primary point of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists.\nThe phrase \"inalienable rights\" refers to the rights that people have that cannot be taken away. This debate was not the primary point of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists.\nThe choice of words for this debate is important. The Federalists and the Anti-Federalists did not agree on whether people had inalienable rights. The Anti-Federalists thought that people's rights should be protected by the Constitution. The Federalists did not think that the Constitution needed to say anything about people's rights.\nThe slave trade was another important issue. The Constitution did not have a specific provision banning the slave trade. This issue was important to both Federalists and Anti-Federalists. However, the primary point of disagreement between the two sides was over the strength of the federal government relative to the states.\nThe Federalists wanted a strong national, or federal, government. They believed that a strong central government was necessary to keep order and to make decisions for the good of the whole country.\nThe Anti-Federalists wanted a weaker central government. They were worried that a strong central government would be too powerful and would take away the rights of the states and the people.\nThe choice of whether representation in Congress should be equal among states or proportional to population was important to both sides. However, this was not the primary point of disagreement.\nThe primary point of disagreement between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists was over the strength of the federal government relative to the states."}

Typically, the chairperson and most of the members of a committee are from the political party that controls the majority of committees. In the United States, the party that has the most representatives in the House is usually the party that controls the majority of committees.\nThe membership of committees often overrepresents constituencies with the greatest stake in the committee's business. This means that committees have members who come from districts that have a strong interest in the committee's work. So, the opinions of these committees may not mirror the opinions of the general public.\nMost committees are too small to include representatives of all popular opinions. This means that committees may not include members who represent the opinions of the general public.\nThe minority party controls nearly half of all committees. This means that even though the majority party has more representatives, the minority party has a significant number of committees to influence. So, the opinions of these committees may not mirror the opinions of the general public.\nCommittee members often lose track of their constituents' priorities because of their frequent contact with special-interest lobbyists. This means that committee members may be influenced by special-interest groups, which may not have the same opinions as the general public. So, the opinions of these committees may not mirror the opinions of the general public."}

This clause has come to be known as the \"elastic clause.\"\nThe clause has been the subject of much debate and has been interpreted in different ways. One way to interpret the elastic clause is that it gives Congress broad discretion to exercise its powers in a flexible manner. This means that Congress may choose to regulate a particular issue by using its taxing, spending, or commerce powers, among others.\nAnother way to interpret the elastic clause is that it requires Congress to use the least restrictive means possible to exercise its powers. This means that Congress may only use its powers in a way that is necessary to achieve a legitimate government purpose.\nSOLUTION: The elastic clause does not specify what types of laws are \"necessary and proper.\" Instead, it leaves it to Congress to determine how to use its powers in a way that will achieve the Constitution's objectives.\nSo, Congress can use the elastic clause to authorize the Treasury to print money in order to pay the country's debts. This would be a necessary and proper use of Congress's power to borrow money.\nCongress can also use the elastic clause to impose workplace safety standards. This would be a necessary and proper use of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.\nChanging citizenship requirements would not be a necessary and proper use of Congress's power. The Constitution grants the power to set citizenship requirements to Congress, but it does not say that this power is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out any other power.\nIncreasing tax rates would not be a necessary and proper use of Congress's power to collect taxes. The Constitution grants the power to collect taxes to Congress, but it does not say that this power is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out any other power."}

This trend has led to a greater number of candidates participating in primary elections.\nSome candidates have complained that primary elections are being held too early. They argue that this trend is confusing to voters and dilutes the importance of the general election.\nSOLUTION: Look at the answer choice.\nIn the past decade, many states have moved their presidential primary elections up to increase the significance of their election results.\nRestricting the number of entrants in the presidential race is not the purpose of moving up primary election dates.\nConvincing the national government to move forward the date of the general election is not a reason states move forward their primary elections.\nMinimizing the cost of running the election is not the purpose of moving up primary election dates.\nIncreasing the significance of their election results is the purpose of moving up primary election dates."}

Vetoes can occur at different points in the legislative process. A president may veto a bill that has not yet become law. In this case, the bill is returning to its chamber of origin.\nA pocket veto is a veto that occurs when Congress is adjourned. If a president vetoes a bill when Congress is adjourned, the bill does not become a law.\nThere are some important things to know about pocket vetoes:\nA pocket veto can happen only if Congress is adjourned. If Congress is in session, the president can neither veto nor pocket-veto a bill.\nThe president has 10 days to veto a bill when Congress is in session. If the president does not sign the bill within 10 days, it becomes a law without the president's signature.

Executive orders can include instructions on a wide range of subjects: things like organizing executive branch agencies, assigning specific duties to them, or directing that particular actions be taken.\nExecutive orders are not laws. As a matter of fact, executive orders are not even signed by the President. They are not sent to Congress. Instead, executive orders are published in the Federal Register, the official newspaper of the federal government.\nPresidents have used executive orders for a long time. But in the past, Presidents often used executive orders primarily to direct members of the President's own administration. Today, executive orders often try to reach outside of the administration and directly affect the general public.\nOne thing executive orders are not is a way for the President to get around Congress. If a President tries to use an executive order to do something that is clearly the province of Congress, that executive order may be nullified by a court.\nSOLUTION: Executive orders bypass congressional approval. An executive order is not a law, so it does not need to be approved by Congress.\nPresidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s.

But, in some cases, the governments work together on a project.\nWhen the federal government provides most of the funding for a project in which multiple levels of government work together, the principle of fiscal federalism is realized. Fiscal federalism is the way that the governments raise and spend their own funds.\nIn a project, the federal government may provide funding to other levels of government to pay for part of the project. This is called grant-based funding. When the federal government provides most of the funding for a project, the project is often done in partnership with the federal government. So, grant-based funding and fiscal federalism are similar in some ways. But, they are not the same thing.\nConfederation is a type of government. In a confederation, the governments of the states or provinces work together. In a federation, the governments of different levels within a country work together.\nDual federalism is a type of system.

The federal government is a system of separated powers, or branches, with each branch having a different role in the government. This system makes it difficult for any one faction to control all branches of the government."}
{"question": "All of the following can be considered true about the impact of a higher level of education on voting habits EXCEPT", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "voters are more likely to support government-enforced affirmative action programs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "voters are more likely to support environmental protection efforts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "voters are more likely to support public prayer in schools"}, {"label": "D", "text": "voters are less likely to support restrictions on abortion rights"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: One of the functions of education is to help people make informed decisions. As a result, a higher level of education is generally associated with specific voting habits.\nHere are three ways in which a higher level of education may affect voting habits:\nMany highly educated people are liberal. Liberal people are more likely to support government-enforced affirmative action programs, international aid, and the legalization of marijuana.\nMany highly educated people are concerned about the environment. Environmental protection is a critical issue for many liberal people.\nMany highly educated people are against prayer in schools. Public prayer in schools is an issue that affects many people's views on the role of religion in society.\nSome conservative people are against abortion rights. Restrictions on abortion rights is a critical issue for many conservative people.\nHowever, it is important to note that education is not destiny. People's voting habits are influenced by a variety of factors, including their political beliefs, social values, and life experiences."}

In this case, the bill goes back to the House of Representatives, and the House of Representatives will consider the version that the Senate passed.\nIf the House of Representatives passes the version of the bill that the Senate passed, the bill is sent to the president to be signed.\nIf the House of Representatives does not pass the version of the bill that the Senate passed, or if the House of Representatives passes a different version of the bill, the bill goes back to the Senate. The Senate can either accept the changes made by the House of Representatives or insist on the original version of the bill. If the Senate and House of Representatives do not agree on the same version of the bill, it is likely that a conference committee will be formed to resolve the differences.\nAll amendments to the bill are invalidated, and the original version of the bill is sent to the president to sign. This answer is incorrect.\nThe two legislative bodies form a conference committee. This answer is incorrect."}
{"question": "Which of the following accounts for the fact that the power and prestige of the presidency have grown since 1932? I.

As a result, legislators may be more willing to listen to these groups than to other special interest groups.\nMany of the reasons that business and investment groups are successful in lobbying involve financial resources and access to legislators. But having the most voters in a district is not directly related to a group's success in lobbying. And while contributions to campaigns can help groups gain access to legislators, they do not necessarily lead to successful lobbying outcomes."}

The following excerpt from a case called United States v. Warren, 107 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 1997), demonstrates how different courts have approached the issue:\n\"The Supreme Court has not held that the right to privacy is implicit in the Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court has, however, held that the Fourth Amendment protects a right to privacy. See, e.g., United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 713 (1984). The Court has also held that the First Amendment protects a right to privacy in certain contexts. See, e.g., Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600 (1977). In general, however, the right to privacy has been based on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 152-153 (1973).\"\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the right to privacy is implied by the Bill of Rights. The right to privacy is protected by the Fourth Amendment and by the First Amendment in some contexts. The right to privacy is also protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."}

This means that the president's political party must be able to persuade at least 10 moderate members of Congress to join them in supporting the president's veto.\nThe chief justice of the Supreme Court was appointed by the president. This factor does not affect the likelihood that a presidential veto will be overturned.\nThe president's successful reelection campaign advocated bipartisanship. This factor does not affect the likelihood that a presidential veto will be overturned.\nThe majority of American citizens support the proposed legislation. This factor does not affect the likelihood that a presidential veto will be overturned.\nApproximately 30% of the senators and representatives are members of the presidential political party. This means that the president's party has a significant presence in Congress but does not necessarily have control over it.

A pocket veto is a veto that occurs when Congress is adjourned and the president is not required to take any action on a bill.\nIf Congress is not adjourned, the president can veto the bill. But if the president does not sign the bill within 10 days, and Congress is not adjourned, the bill becomes law without the president's signature.\nA line-item veto is a type of legislative veto. A line-item veto is a veto that allows the president to reject certain items in an appropriations bill.\nAn adjournment is a formal suspension of Congress. An adjournment can occur when Congress is dissolved.\nA writ of certiorari is a type of legal action. A writ of certiorari can be issued by the Supreme Court.

This means that the Constitution grants the power to Congress to make any laws that are necessary and proper to carry out its specified powers.\nSOLUTION: The elastic clause is implicated when Congress exercises its powers to make laws that are necessary and proper. This is illustrated in each of the examples above."}

Because they are already in office, incumbents can use their government office to raise funds for their campaigns. They can also use their position to get media attention for their campaigns.\nMore than 80 percent of incumbents in Congress are reelected to office. This high rate of reelection shows that incumbents have a significant advantage over challengers."}

This constitutional fragmentation of power helps to maintain a balance of power and prevents the government from becoming too powerful.\nJudicial activism involves courts making policy decisions. This can destabilize public policy because it allows unelected judges to make decisions that are normally made by elected officials.\nCooperation between the two major political parties can help maintain stability by allowing different branches to work together to achieve common goals.\nAffirmative action programs are designed to help people who have been traditionally excluded from opportunities. These programs can be controversial and may not consistently contribute to stability."}

To be elected, a candidate must receive a majority of the votes in that district.\nThis system tends to favor two major parties. With two major parties, each party can focus its campaign on a different part of the country. This makes it more likely that one of the two major parties will win each district.\nThird parties can also participate in this system. But third parties find it difficult to win elections. This is because, in most districts, the major parties' candidates win most of the votes.\nA single-member district system can result in campaigns that focus on a single issue. But this is not a direct result of the system. Instead, it is a result of the fact that candidates need to win a majority of the votes to be elected.\nNational campaigns can be conducted without incurring great expense. This is a direct result of a single-member district system. Because candidates need to win a majority of the votes in their district, they can use less money to campaign. They can focus on the issues that are most important to voters in their district."}

For example, they may believe that the court's decision could affect them directly or indirectly. They may have expertise about a subject that is relevant to the case. They may want to influence the court's decision in a way that will benefit their political, social, or economic agenda.\nSOLUTION: Each of the choices gives a reason why someone may want to file an amicus curiae brief.\nFormer presidents who wish to send instructions to the justices they appointed are not able to file an amicus curiae brief. This is not a good reason to file an amicus curiae brief.\nA senator who wants to impeach a Supreme Court justice may want to file an amicus curiae brief to provide information that could help justify the impeachment. This is a reason why someone may want to file an amicus curiae brief.\nCompanies that are not involved in a court case but wish to affect the outcome may have a strong interest in the case's outcome. For example, the companies may be competitors to the companies involved in the case, and they may believe that the court's decision could affect them.

If a voter is a member of a political party, they are likely to vote for that party's candidate.\nGender, religion, and age are less likely to predict how someone will vote.\nSOLUTION: Socioeconomic status is a strong predictor of voting behavior. Voters with higher incomes are more likely to vote for candidates who support lower taxes and less government spending.

The first Congress met in 1789, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791.\nThe Framers' unqualified commitment to individual rights is a conclusion that goes beyond the evidence given. The evidence does not show that the Framers had an unqualified commitment to individual rights.\nThe small states' determination to receive equal representation in the legislature is a conclusion that goes beyond the evidence given. The evidence does not show that the small states had a determination to receive equal representation in the legislature.\nThe Northern states' support for abolitionism is a conclusion that goes beyond the evidence given.

This approach to judging is based on the idea that the Constitution is a flexible document that can be used to promote social justice.\nJudicial restraint is a doctrine of constitutional interpretation that requires courts to apply the Constitution as it is written, without adding or interpreting its provisions in ways that go beyond their language and original intent. This approach to judging is based on the idea that the Constitution is a fixed document that does not need to be changed in order to promote justice.\nDue process is a principle of constitutional law that requires courts to protect the rights of individuals by following fair procedures.\nEx post facto lawmaking is a type of legislative action that is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. Ex post facto laws are laws that are applied to events that occurred before the laws were passed. Such laws are prohibited because they can punish people for actions that were not illegal at the time they were taken.\nSOLUTION: To engage in judicial activism, a Supreme Court must be willing to change public policy and alter judicial precedent. This means that the Court must be willing to disregard long-standing legal rules and instead apply the Constitution in ways that promote justice.\nThe other three types of Supreme Court behavior \u2013 due process, judicial restraint, and ex post facto lawmaking \u2013 do not involve changing public policy or legal precedent."}

In the United States, realignment has occurred in both major political parties. For example, the realignment of the Democratic Party from the 1930s to the 1960s brought in voters who had supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and emphasized the role of government in helping people. The realignment of the Republican Party from the 1960s to the 1980s brought in voters who had supported Barry Goldwater and emphasized the importance of individual freedom.\nCoalition building involves forming temporary alliances to work on specific issues. In the United States, coalition building has occurred among groups with diverse interests. For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, the environmental movement worked with urban groups to pass laws to clean up polluted areas.\nAn impeachment is a formal charge that a government official has committed an offense. Impeachment can result in the official's removal from office. In the United States, impeachment can be initiated by the House of Representatives. The Senate tries the impeachment case.\nA recall election is an election in which voters can remove an elected official from office. Recall elections can be initiated by members of the public who collect enough signatures on a petition."}

The national government is divided into three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution is an example of how federalism is implemented. The Tenth Amendment states that any powers not given to the United States by the Constitution are given to the states.\nThe process by which international treaties are completed is an example of how the national government shares power with other levels of government.\nThe special constitutional status of Washington, D.C., is an example of how the national government has a different relationship with one level of government (the district) than with the states.\nThe system of checks and balances among the three branches of the national government is an example of how federalism works. The three branches of the national government are separate and equal. This separation of powers helps prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful."}

It was created by the Founding Fathers, who wanted to create a stronger central government than the one provided by the Articles of Confederation.\nThe Founding Fathers knew that a strong central government would need to have the power to hear disputes between citizens of different states. So, they created the Supreme Court. But the Constitution also addressed other issues. For example, the Constitution included a bill of rights that would protect citizens from the government. And the Constitution gave the central government the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states."}

These \"safe\" states can be counted on to vote for a candidate from one party, so that candidate can focus their campaigns on more closely contested states.\nCampaigning extensively in states that heavily favor one party over the other can help a candidate secure their party's nomination. However, this strategy does not necessarily help a candidate win the general election.\nSpending more television advertising money in the Plains States would not help a candidate win the general election. The Plains States are not a battleground region in presidential elections.\nCampaigning more heavily in states with large populations would help a candidate win the general election. Large populations can translate into more electoral votes.\nAvoiding battleground states and focusing their campaigns on \"safe\" states would not help a candidate win the general election. Campaigning in safe states does not help a candidate secure the support of swing voters."}

The House has a set of rules that govern how members can speak and be recognized to speak. These rules make it difficult to hold the floor for an extended period. In the Senate, there are no such rules, and so a senator can speak for as long as he or she wants without being cut off."}

The executive branch is headed by the president. The legislative branch is made up of the Senate and House of Representatives. The judicial branch is made up of federal courts.\nThe powers of the executive branch are balanced by the legislative branch. This means that the legislative branch has the power to limit the actions of the executive branch. One way the legislative branch can balance the powers of the executive branch is by declaring war. This is a power that is explicitly given to the legislative branch by the Constitution.\nAnother way the legislative branch can balance the powers of the executive branch is by impeaching and convicting a president for high crimes and misdemeanors. Impeachment is a formal accusation of wrongdoing. If the president is impeached, he or she is put on trial in the Senate. If the president is convicted, he or she can be removed from office.\nA third way the legislative branch can balance the powers of the executive branch is by ratifying treaties. The president can make a treaty, but it is the Senate that must ratify, or approve, the treaty. This gives the legislative branch a way to balance the power to make a treaty between the executive and legislative branches.\nA fourth way the legislative branch can balance the powers of the executive branch is by confirming a president's nominee to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the highest federal court. A president can nominate a person to be a Supreme Court justice. But the Senate must confirm, or approve, the nominee. This gives the legislative branch a way to balance the power to pick a Supreme Court justice between the executive and legislative branches."}

The Presentment Clause requires that bills be presented to the president before becoming law. It also requires that the president take action on the bill. The line-item veto allowed the president to remove individual items from appropriations bills, but it did not require the president to submit the amended bill to the legislature. This violated the Presentment Clause.\nThe line-item veto also violated the principle of separated powers. The Constitution divides power among three branches of government: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The line-item veto gave the president legislative powers that belonged to the Congress. This violated the principle of separated powers."}

In 1932, Roosevelt's New Deal programs were a major change in the dominant political issues. In 1968, Nixon's election marked a major change in the party configuration with the defeat of the Democratic Party, which had controlled the presidency since 1932.\nThe midterm election of 1994 was also a critical election. This election saw a major shift in party alignment that would last for decades. The election resulted in a Republican takeover of Congress for the first time in forty years.\nThe election of 1940 and the election of 2008 were also critical elections. In 1940, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to an unprecedented third term, which marked a change in the nature of the electorate. In 2008, Barack Obama was elected as the first African American president, which was a major change in the dominant political issues.\nThe election of 1948 and the election of 2012 were not critical elections. In 1948, Harry Truman was elected to a full term after succeeding Franklin Roosevelt, and in 2012, Barack Obama was reelected."}

The effect of being closely contested, the age of the voter, and the educational level of the voter are all factors that have influenced turnout in past elections.\nBut these trends do not necessarily hold true in all elections. For example, in a presidential election, many more people turn out to vote than in a midterm election. And in some elections, issues or candidates may inspire a higher-than-usual turnout from particular age or education groups.\nThe statement about affluent individuals is not necessarily true.

This is because, by this point, the president's agenda has largely been set, and he or she may not have the same influence over Congress.\nInternational crises can also reduce a president's power. When crises occur, the president's attention is often diverted from his or her domestic agenda to international issues.\nA strong economy and high approval ratings can also reduce a president's power. With a strong economy, the president may not need to propose new legislation to stay in power. And, with high approval ratings, the president may not need to compromise with Congress to remain popular.\nThe circumstances described in II and III can both lead to a reduction in a president's power.

These regulations can make it more difficult for some people to vote, and the preclearance provision can create additional obstacles to changing election laws.\nPolitical efficacy is the belief that one's vote can make a difference.

Many constitutions, including the United States Constitution, have principles, or basic ideas, that help guide the interpretation and application of the constitution. Some of the important constitutional principles include:\nSeparation of powers: This principle holds that the three main branches of government\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial\u2014should be separate and independent. This principle helps to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.\nChecks and balances: Related to the principle of separation of powers, checks and balances is the idea that each branch of government has the power to stop or limit the actions of the other branches.\nVertical federalism: This principle holds that the national government and the state governments should be separate and independent. This principle helps to prevent the national government from becoming too powerful.\nHorizontal federalism: This principle holds that the national government and the state governments should work together. This principle helps to prevent the country from being divided into rival groups.\nDue process of law: This principle requires that the government follow a fair and lawful process when it enforces laws.\nComity: This principle encourages the branches of government and the states to show respect and courtesy to each other.\nThe concept of separation of powers is the most important idea in the system of checks and balances. The separation of powers is a fundamental principle of the United States Constitution. The Constitution does not explicitly mention the principle of separation of powers. But the Constitution does make each branch of government responsible for a different type of work.\nFor example, the legislative branch is responsible for writing laws. The executive branch is responsible for enforcing laws. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting laws.\nEach branch of government is also allowed to certain powers. For example, the legislative branch is allowed to make laws. The executive branch is allowed to enforce laws. The judicial branch is allowed to interpret laws.\nThese ideas of separation of powers are not just about how the branches of government interact with each other. They are also about how the branches interact with the other parts of government. For example, when the legislative branch passes a law, the executive branch must enforce it. But if the executive branch thinks the law is unconstitutional, it may not enforce it. In this case, the executive branch is using its power to interpret the Constitution to decide whether the law is constitutional."}

A writ of certiorari is an order that says, \"Show us your papers.\" When the Court issues a writ of certiorari, it reviews the papers from the lower court.\nIf the Court does not want to hear the case, but wants to provide guidance to the lower courts, it issues a writ of habeas corpus. A writ of habeas corpus is an order that says, \"Produce the prisoner.\"\nThe Supreme Court can also issue amicus curiae briefs.
