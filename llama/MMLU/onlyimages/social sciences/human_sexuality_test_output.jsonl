{"question": "Which of the following is/are true of gonorrhea?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "can be treated with antibiotics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "has a high risk of infection with a single exposure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected"}, {"label": "D", "text": "infections are limited to genital areas"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacterium. Like other STDs, gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics. Since it can be treated, it is not true that it is always asymptomatic (without symptoms). Also, since it can be treated, infections are not limited to the genital areas. A high risk of infection with a single exposure means that a person is likely to become infected with gonorrhea after having sexual contact with an infected person. So, B. is true. Infections are limited to the genital areas means that gonorrhea does not infect other areas of the body. So, D. is false. A small percentage of those infected with gonorrhea are asymptomatic, so C. is false."}
{"question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk.

This theory explains how people can learn to imitate the behavior of others, including behavior that is sexual in nature.\nScript theory is a type of social learning theory. It focuses on the ways in which people learn by repeating patterns of behavior. These patterns are stored in a person's memory as \"scripts.\" When a person is faced with a situation that matches a script in their memory, they are more likely to follow the script, using the same words and actions that were used in the original situation.\nSociobiology is a theory that applies the principles of evolution to the study of behavior. It is concerned with the ways in which behavior is influenced by both genes and environment. Sociobiology uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to the behavior of others on a person's behavior.\nPsychoanalytic theory is a theory that is concerned with the ways in which unconscious thoughts and feelings can influence behavior. This theory uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior. According to psychoanalytic theory, exposure to erotica can cause a person to develop unconscious desires and to imitate the sexual behavior of others."}

{"question": "The egg can be fertilized until about _______ after ovulation.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "6 hours"}, {"label": "B", "text": "24 hours"}, {"label": "C", "text": "72 hours"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1 week"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Fertilization is the process by which a male gamete, or sperm, and a female gamete, or egg, fuse to form a fertilized egg. Fertilization usually occurs in the fallopian tube, and the fertilized egg then moves to the uterus.\nOvulation is the release of an egg from the ovary. The egg can be fertilized until about 24 hours after ovulation.\nLecture: Many factors can affect fertilization. One factor is the timing of ovulation.\nOvulation is the release of an egg from the ovary. The egg can be fertilized until about 24 hours after ovulation. This is a small window of opportunity.\nSOLUTION: The fertile window is the time when an egg is most likely to be released from the ovary and be available for fertilization. This window is usually 6 days long, but it can vary.\nYou can use an ovulation predictor kit to determine your fertile window. These kits measure the surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) that occurs just before ovulation.\nAlternatively, you can calculate your fertile window based on your menstrual cycle. Most women have a 28-day cycle, but cycles can range from 21 to 35 days.\nTo calculate your fertile window, subtract 18 from the length of your cycle. The shortest fertile window is 6 days, and the longest is 12 days.\nFor example, if your cycle is 30 days, you would subtract 18 from 30.\n30 - 18 = 12.\nSo, your fertile window is 12 days.\nIf your cycle is 28 days, you would subtract 18 from 28.\n28 - 18 = 10.\nSo, your fertile window is 10 days."}

The corpus luteum produces the hormones progesterone and estrogen.\nProgesterone helps prepare the uterus for pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum breaks down and hormone levels decrease. This causes shedding of the uterine lining.\nSOLUTION: The corpus luteum is the glandular mass that forms after the follicle releases an egg. It is a temporary gland.\nThe corpus cavernosum is a sponge-like tissue in the penis that fills with blood to cause erections.\nThe corpus callosum is a large bundle of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain.\nThe corpus glandula is not a real term."}

It involves the following stages:\nproliferation: The number of cells in the seminiferous tubules increases.\ngerminal stage: Sperm cells begin to develop.\nspermatid stage: Sperm cells finish developing.\nStep 3: During sperm activation, hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) triggers the acrosome reaction. This reaction causes the sperm to release enzymes that can help it break through the jelly-like layer surrounding the egg.\nStep 4: The journey through the female reproductive tract includes the following stages:\nmixing: Sperm and egg mix.\nacrosome reaction: Sperm react to chemicals in the egg by reacting with their enzymes.\npenetration: A sperm penetrates the egg.\n Step 5: The fertilized egg begins to divide and grow. This is the beginning of a new human life.\nSOLUTION: Ovulation occurs at the end of the ovarian cycle. This is when an egg is released from the ovary.\nThe journey through the female reproductive tract begins at ovulation. So, the environment for sperm passage is most hospitable just at ovulation."}

The level of the spinal cord at which the injury occurred, the man's age, and whether the spinal cord was partially or completely severed are factors that can affect the man's ability to have erections.\nErections require a combination of nerve sensation, mental arousal, and muscle relaxation. If the spinal cord is injured at the level of the 4th ventricle or lower, the part of the spinal cord that controls the nerves that bring sensation to the penis is likely to be affected. This can interfere with the sensation of pleasure that leads to an erection.\nA partial spinal cord injury at high levels may spare some sensation in the pelvis and genitalia. In contrast, a complete spinal cord injury usually results in a complete loss of sensation below the level of the injury.\nA older man may have more difficulty having an erection than a younger man. This may be because of age-related changes in the body, such as decreased testosterone levels."}

This is based on the church's teachings against premarital sex and extramarital sex.\nThe church also considers homosexual acts to be a sin. But it is important to note that the church distinguishes between homosexual inclination and homosexual acts. It considers homosexual inclination to be not sinful in itself, but it teaches that acting on it is.\nThe pill is not a sin. It is a medication that is sometimes prescribed to regulate women's reproductive systems.\nThe church allows Catholics to use the pill for this purpose. But it also teaches that Catholics should be open to life. So, Catholics may not use the pill as a form of birth control."}

In ZIFT, mature eggs are collected from an ovary, fertilized in a laboratory, and then transferred to the fallopian tube.\nEmbryo transfer is a procedure in which an embryo is transferred from a fertilized egg culture to the uterus.\nArtificial insemination is a fertility treatment in which sperm are placed in a woman's uterus or cervix to facilitate fertilization.\nSOLUTION: Xena has been able to conceive but has repeatedly miscarried early in her pregnancies. To determine the best option for her to have a child, you need to figure out why she has had miscarriages.\nMiscarriages are caused by chromosomal abnormalities. As a woman gets older, the eggs in her ovaries become older too. This increases the chance that the eggs will have chromosomal abnormalities.\nIVF and ZIFT can help Xena get pregnant, but they do not reduce the risk of chromosomal abnormalities. So, these procedures may not help Xena avoid miscarriages.\nEmbryo transfer can reduce the risk of miscarriage. By transferring one or more embryos, Xena can increase her chances of having a viable pregnancy."}

Some couples engage in swinging, and they have their own norms and values. It is important to understand that swinging is not mainstream. So, statements about swinging need to be evaluated based on how they apply to swinging, a specific lifestyle.\nThe norms of swinging include expectations about how swinging couples will behave. These norms may include expectations about how many partners a couple will have, whether partners are equal in status, and how partners will interact.\nMale and female homosexual acts are not common and widely accepted among swinging couples. Most swinging couples are heterosexual.\nIt is expected that couples will engage in sex with the same partners on several occasions. This is a norm of swinging.\nThe combination of two men with one woman is a common introduction to swinging. This is a norm of swinging.\nMost swingers also tend to have tolerant attitudes towards various forms of \"exotic\" sexuality. This means that swinging couples may be open to exploring different sexual activities. This is a norm of swinging."}

These researchers assume that sex is a trait that is controlled by genes.\nMany traits, including behaviors, are controlled by multiple genes. The effect of each gene is called an allele. Alternative alleles are called types.\nSome types have types. For example, the type called A and the type called B can have the type called C as a component of their types. In this case, C is a subtype of both A and B.\nAn organism's type is a combination of its alleles. An organism's behavior is a combination of its types.\nSince sex is a behavior, sex is a combination of an organism's types.\nSo, the central function of sex is to reproduce.\nBy having sex, an organism ensures that its types will be represented in the next generation. This increases the chances that the organism's alleles will be passed on to its offspring."}

He focuses on two things that are part of many cultures: religion and sex. Unwin's thesis is that the rise and fall of civilizations can be traced to their religion and sex practices.\nUnwin uses data to show that civilizations have risen and fallen based on their sexual behavior. Civilizations that have encouraged sexual restraint have endured. Those that have not have collapsed. Unwin looks at data from the ancient world.

So, the first thing to do is to put aside any preconceived notions you might have about sexual orientation and development.\nThen, look at each answer choice.\nC. This choice is based on research that shows that having at least one supportive and accepting caregiver is important for healthy development. This is true for children with parents of all types of sexual orientations. So, as long as Timmy has at least one supportive and accepting caregiver, he will have a healthy development.\nPopularity and social skills are not the same thing. So, a child who is popular is not necessarily social. And a child who has good social skills is not necessarily popular.\nTimmy's sexual orientation may affect his social skills. But it is not the only thing that can affect them. So, it is not possible to say that he will lag behind his peers based on his sexual orientation.\nIt is not possible to predict if a child will be gay based on any information provided."}

During the follicular phase, a group of eggs and their surrounding follicles start to grow in the ovaries.\nThe luteal phase begins after ovulation and ends with menstruation. During the luteal phase, the lecture: An embryo is a fertilized egg. The embryo needs the uterus to grow and develop. The lining, or uterine lining, is thick and rich in blood during the luteal phase. This makes it easier for an embryo to implant in the uterus.\nIf an embryo does not implant, the uterine lining is shed. This is called menstruation.\nOvulation is the release of an egg from the ovary. Ovulation usually occurs around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle.

{"question": "Menstruation is triggered by...", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "...a sharp increase in estrogen levels"}, {"label": "B", "text": "...a sharp increase in progesterone levels"}, {"label": "C", "text": "...a sharp decrease in estrogen and progesterone levels"}, {"label": "D", "text": "...a sharp increase in estrogen and progesterone levels"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Estrogen and progesterone levels are part of a feedback loop that regulates menstruation.\nWhen estrogen levels rise, they signal the ovaries to stop releasing eggs. At the same time, estrogen levels trigger a surge in progesterone. As progesterone levels rise, they prepare the uterus for pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels drop, and estrogen levels follow suit. This drop in estrogen levels triggers the uterus to shed its lining, causing a menstrual period."}
{"question": "Which of the following concerning self-disclosure in relationships is supported by research?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "when one partner in a relationship self-discloses, the other is unlikely to do so"}, {"label": "B", "text": "self-disclosure on the part of one partner often leads to self-disclosure on the part of the other"}, {"label": "C", "text": "there is a negative correlation between amount of self-disclosure and relationship satisfaction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "there is no relationship between amount of self-disclosure and relationship satisfaction"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Self-disclosure is a process that involves one person voluntarily revealing information about themselves to another. This process is a key part of building and maintaining close relationships.\nResearch has shown that self-disclosure can help partners in a relationship feel closer to each other, increase their sense of intimacy, and enhance their relationship satisfaction.\nOne of the ways self-disclosure can affect relationships is by creating a sense of mutuality. When one partner self-discloses, the other is likely to self-disclose in return. This can help both partners feel more comfortable sharing information with each other.\nHowever, the amount of self-disclosure in a relationship is not always correlated with relationship satisfaction. So, the fact that one partner self-discloses does not mean that the other will.\nAdditionally, too much self-disclosure may be associated with a decrease in relationship satisfaction. When one partner self-discloses too much too quickly, it may create a sense of overload or even repulsion in the other partner."}

Some of the following criticisms are plausible, while others are not.\nChoice \"Sample size was relatively small\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Gay and straight groups were not equivalent in terms of the number of deaths due to AIDS.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Lesbians were omitted from the study.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"All of the above.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Omitting lesbians from the study does not seem to be a valid criticism of the study's design. The study was focused on men and women, not on lesbians. The study found that male and female brains were different, but the study did not examine the brains of non-heterosexual people.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"The study was conducted during the height of the AIDS epidemic. Many of the gay men in the study had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The exclusion of these individuals from the study may have affected the results. However, the study found that the brains of gay men and heterosexual men were different, so it is unclear how much the exclusion of individuals who had died of AIDS-related illnesses affected the results.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"The study may have failed to prove that differences in brain function are the cause of differences in sexual behavior. It may be that sexual behavior affects brain function. For example, it is known that sexual behavior can affect mood. So, it is possible that differences in sexual behavior affect brain function. Therefore, differences in brain function may be the result of differences in sexual behavior, not the cause.\" is a valid point."}
