This is a stable equilibrium because, in this case, both parties are getting the best deal they can get.\nIf the demand curve shifted, the equilibrium price and quantity would change, but none of the changes would make either party better off. So, neither party has an incentive to deviate from their current strategies.\nHowever, if the supply curve shifted, the equilibrium price and quantity would change. If the change in the price made either party better off, that party would have an incentive to deviate from their current strategy.\nThere is only one way the marginal revenue curve and the marginal cost curve can intersect: when they are the same curve. So, the marginal revenue curve intersects the marginal cost curve at a single point. This is a stable equilibrium because, in this case, the revenue and the cost are equal.\nIf the demand curve shifted, the equilibrium price and quantity would change. But the change in the price would not affect whether the marginal revenue curve intersects the marginal cost curve. So, neither party has an incentive to deviate from their current strategies.\nAn unstable equilibrium is an equilibrium where one party has an incentive to deviate from their strategy. So, the equilibrium is unstable and each party would like to switch strategies."}

These higher prices can result in a lower consumer surplus and a higher joint profit for the firms.\nOne reason why the government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry is that it can result in higher prices for consumers. When firms collude, they may choose to charge higher prices than they would charge if they were competing. This can result in a lower consumer surplus, as consumers must pay the higher prices."}

So, in their decision-making, oligopolists must consider how their competitors will respond to their choices.\nOne situation that may arise in an oligopoly is a price decrease. If one oligopolist firms lowers its price, the other oligopolists may follow suit. However, if one oligopolist raises its price, the other oligopolists may not follow.\nThis means that the demand curve for an oligopolist may be downward-sloping, but not as steep as the demand curve for a monopolist. This is because in an oligopoly, firms have to compete with each other, which means that they cannot charge as high prices as they could in a monopoly.\nSOLUTION: When rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase, the demand curve facing the oligopolist is not as steep as it would be in a monopoly. This is because the price decrease has a smaller effect on the demand curve than it would in a monopoly.\nSo, the demand curve is downward-sloping but less steep than a monopolist's demand curve. It is highly inelastic, but not perfectly horizontal."}

Each of these barriers can help protect a firm from new competitors.\nSome of these barriers may also help a firm earn short-run profits. But short-run profits are not the primary purpose of these barriers.\nPrice discrimination is a strategy that can help a firm earn higher profits. But price discrimination requires that a firm have some control over supply and demand. So, patents, control of resources, and economies of scale are not requirements for price discrimination.\nSOLUTION: Look at the five strategies for earning higher profits. Figure out which strategies are included in each potential source of profits.\nEconomies of scale may help a firm earn higher profits by reducing the cost of production. But economies of scale do not directly help a firm earn higher profits through price discrimination, exclusive licenses, or patents.\nControl of resources may help a firm earn higher profits by giving it more control over the supply of certain resources. But control of resources does not directly help a firm earn higher profits through price discrimination, exclusive licenses, or patents.\nExclusive licenses may help a firm earn higher profits by allowing it to sell its products or services in a particular geographic area. But exclusive licenses do not directly help a firm earn higher profits through economies of scale or control of resources.\nPatents may help a firm earn higher profits by allowing it to prevent other firms from selling similar products or services. But patents do not directly help a firm earn higher profits through control of resources or exclusive licenses.\nPrice discrimination may help a firm earn higher profits by allowing it to charge different prices to different customers. But price discrimination requires that a firm have some control over supply and demand, which may be obtained through economies of scale or control of resources.\nSOLUTION: Choice \"B.\":\nA short-run profit is a profit that a firm earns for a particular period of time. To earn a short-run profit, a firm must earn more money than it costs to produce its products or services.\nA barrier to entry is a requirement for a firm to earn a short-run profit. So, each of the listed items is a requirement for a firm to earn a short-run profit."}

These costs include things like the opportunity cost of not doing something else with the business's resources.\nWhen a business produces a product or provides a service, it incurs both explicit and implicit costs. The economic costs of a product or service are the total amount of these costs.\nEconomic profits is a measure of the difference between the economic costs of producing a product or providing a service and the economic value of the product or service. This measure reflects the extent to which the business is earning more than it is spending.\nOpportunity costs are the costs of not doing something. In the context of a business, the opportunity cost of not producing a product or providing a service is the economic profit that the business could have earned if it had done so.\nSOLUTION: Economic Profits = Accounting Profits.\nWhen a business has economic profits, it is earning more than it is spending. But these profits may not represent the business's total profits.\nTo calculate the business's total profits, you need to include all of the income that the business received from its operations. This includes both its accounting profits and its economic profits.\nSo, Economic Profits = Accounting Profits.\nEconomic Costs = Explicit Costs plus Implicit Costs.\nThe economic costs of a product or service include both the explicit costs and the implicit costs.\nExplicit costs are costs that can be easily identified and measured in monetary terms. These costs include things like the cost of raw materials and the wages of employees.\nImplicit costs are costs that are not easily identified or measured in monetary terms. These costs include things like the opportunity cost of not doing something else with the business's resources.\nSo, Economic Costs = Explicit Costs plus Implicit Costs.\nEconomic Costs = Explicit Costs minus Implicit Costs.\nThis calculation is incorrect.\nWhen a business incurs implicit costs, those costs are included in the economic costs of the product or service. So, the economic costs are not equal to the explicit costs minus the implicit costs.\nFor example, consider a business that produces bicycles. The business needs to pay its employees to build the bicycles. This is an explicit cost. The business also incurs implicit costs by using resources that could be used for other purposes. For example, the business could use the resources to produce a different product.\nThe economic costs of producing bicycles include both the explicit costs and the implicit costs. So, the economic costs are not equal to the explicit costs minus the implicit costs."}

When negative externalities exist, the socially optimal quantity of output is not equal to the market quantity.\nThe socially optimal quantity of output is the quantity that balances the benefits and costs to society as a whole. This quantity is achieved when the benefits of producing the good exceed the costs, and this happens when the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost.\nOne way to achieve the socially optimal quantity of output is by placing limits on the quantity that can be produced. This can be done through government regulations that set emission limits, for example.\nAnother way is by imposing a tax on the good. This tax can be designed to reflect the negative externality. For example, if the negative externality is air pollution, a tax can be imposed on the good based on the amount of pollution that is produced in the process of producing the good. This tax can help to equalize the cost of the good to consumers with the social cost of the negative externality.\nGovernment purchases of the good and setting a minimum on the quantity that can be produced are not ways to achieve the socially optimal quantity of output.\nGovernment purchases of the good can increase the demand for the good, which can increase the market price. This increased price can lead to more output being produced, but it may not be the socially optimal quantity.\nSetting a minimum on the quantity that can be produced can lead to higher prices. This is because the increased price will equal the minimum price. But, as with government purchases, this may not lead to the socially optimal quantity of output."}

The demand for each firm's product is sensitive to that firm's price.\nIf firms are entering an industry that is monopolistically competitive, we would expect the demand for existing firms to become more inelastic. Becoming more inelastic means that the demand for existing firms is less sensitive to their price.\nIf the demand for existing firms is less sensitive to their price, it is also less sensitive to an increase in the market price of the product. So, in an industry that is monopolistically competitive, we would expect the market price of the product to increase as firms enter the industry.\nThe increased market price of the product will increase the demand for existing firms.

This means that each additional unit of output will have a smaller and smaller effect on increasing the firm's total revenue. As a result, the marginal return (or additional revenue) from each unit of output will eventually decrease.\nBecause the marginal return from each unit of output is decreasing, the firm's average cost will eventually increase. The average cost is the total cost divided by the total output. So, as the marginal return from each unit of output decreases, the average cost of each unit of output will eventually increase.\nSOLUTION: Look at the diagram again. It shows how the AVC and AFC can change over time. The AVC first rises, but eventually falls, as output increases. This means that the AVC will have a positive slope until it reaches its peak, and a negative slope thereafter. The AFC also rises, but eventually falls, as output increases. This means that the AFC will have a positive slope until it reaches its peak, and a negative slope thereafter.\nThe Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns is responsible for the fact that the AVC will have a negative slope. As output increases, each additional unit of output has a smaller and smaller effect on the total output. So, the marginal return from each unit of output decreases.

For example, if you increase the number of workers from 2 to 3, you can increase the number of factories from 2 to 3. This increase in the number of factories can increase the production of the output.\nHowever, the addition of more workers also increases the amount of capital per worker. This increase in the amount of capital per worker can decrease the marginal productivity of capital. For example, if the number of workers increases from 2 to 3, the amount of capital per worker increases from 1 to 1.5.

In a competitive labor market, the wages offered by employers will equal the least that workers are willing to accept. This wage is called the market wage.\nAn increase in the market wage makes it more profitable for workers to enter the labor market. So, an increase in the market wage most likely increases the number of students who graduate with the skills needed to work in this labor market.\nAn increase in the demand for the good produced by this labor market increases the market wage. This is because the increase in demand for the good drives up the price of the good. The market wage is equal to the price of the good divided by the number of workers. So, when the price of the good increases, the market wage increases.\nAn increase in the price of a complementary resource increases the market wage. A complementary resource is a resource that is needed to produce the good. For example, the price of oil affects the price of gas. An increase in the price of oil increases the price of gas. As the price of gas increases, the market wage for workers who produce gas increases.\nThe Department of Labor removes the need for workers to pass an exam before they can work in this field. This policy change makes it easier for workers to enter the labor market. So, the policy change most likely increases the number of students who graduate with the skills needed to work in this labor market. However, the policy change does not directly increase the market wage. The market wage is determined by the balance of supply and demand in the labor market."}

When a monopoly forms, it can be tempting for the monopoly firm to charge higher prices and reduce output to increase profits. However, these decisions can result in losses to society as a whole.\nHigher prices can lead to consumer surplus being lost. Consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve. As prices increase, buyers will purchase less of a good. So, consumer surplus will be lost, and buyers will be worse off.\nLower levels of output can lead to producer surplus being lost. Producer surplus is the area under the supply curve. As prices increase, firms will produce less of a good. So, producer surplus will be lost, and firms will be worse off.\nMonopoly prices ensure productive efficiency but cost society allocative efficiency. Monopolies can use their market power to produce goods and services at the most efficient levels. This means that society can benefit from productive efficiency. However, monopolies can charge higher prices than in competitive markets. So, society may pay more for goods and services than it would in a competitive market.\nMonopoly firms do not engage in significant research and development. Whether a monopoly firm engages in research and development depends on the firm's goals. If a monopoly firm believes that research and development will help it maintain or expand its market power, it may engage in research and development."}

In this case, each firm's demand is horizontal, and each firm's price is equal to demand. So, for each firm, Price (P) equals Marginal Revenue (MR).\nUnder monopoly or imperfect competition, each firm has some control over the price and quantity it charges. In this case, Price (P) is greater than Marginal Revenue (MR) for each firm. This is because each firm can charge a price above its marginal cost, which is greater than its marginal revenue.\nSince Price (P) is greater than Marginal Revenue (MR) under monopoly or imperfect competition, and Price (P) equals Marginal Revenue (MR) under perfect competition, we can conclude that Price (P) is greater than Marginal Revenue (MR) under monopoly or imperfect competition."}

The industry has no barriers to entry, and each firm is a price taker. Because of this, each firm faces a demand curve that is perfectly elastic. This means that if the price of the product changes, the quantity demanded will change by the full amount.\nThe equation for the demand curve is:\nquantity demanded = -100 + 100(price)\nIf each firm faces a demand curve like this, then the average revenue for a firm in a perfectly competitive industry is equal to the marginal revenue:\naverage revenue = marginal revenue\nThe average revenue is initially negative because the price is greater than the quantity demanded.

Characteristics can affect how firms in the market compete.\nMonopolistic competition is a market in which a large number of firms sell products that are similar but not identical. Monopolistic competition is a type of imperfect competition.\nOne characteristic of monopolistic competition is that firms compete on price. This means that firms try to lower their prices to attract more customers.\nAnother characteristic of monopolistic competition is that firms have some degree of market power. This means that each firm has some ability to influence the price in the market.\nA third characteristic of monopolistic competition is that there are many firms in the market. This means that no single firm has complete control over the market.\nSOLUTION: Price competition is a form of competition in which firms lower their prices to attract more customers.\nMostly price competition is a characteristic of monopolistic competition.

The utility of a good is a measure of its value to a consumer.\nTotal utility is a measure of the overall value of a good. It is determined by the consumer's highest level of satisfaction, or greatest total amount of satisfaction.\nMarginal utility is a measure of the additional value of an extra unit of a good. It shows how much the consumer's satisfaction increases with each additional unit of the good.\nThe choice of a good that provides the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility is determined by the shapes of the utility and marginal utility curves.\nThe largest total utility is provided by the good with the highest level of marginal utility. The lowest levels of marginal utility are located at the highest levels of total utility. So, the good with the flattest curve (the one with the smallest marginal utility for each unit of total utility) provides the largest total utility.\nThe smallest marginal utility is provided by the good with the lowest level of utility. The good with the lowest levels of utility is air. Breathing air provides a certain level of satisfaction, but each additional unit of air does not increase satisfaction by much.\nPlastic, automobiles, and computers all have increasing marginal utility. This means that the more of these goods you have, the more each additional unit increases your satisfaction. So, these goods will provide a larger marginal utility than air, but they will also provide a smaller total utility."}

Excise taxes can affect the price that consumers pay for a good.\nThe effect of an excise tax on the price to consumers depends on whether the demand curve for the good is price elastic or price inelastic.\nA price elastic demand curve is a demand curve on which the quantity demanded is sensitive to changes in price. So, if the demand curve is price elastic, consumers are highly responsive to changes in price. This means that an excise tax will have a larger effect on the price that consumers pay.\nA price inelastic demand curve is a demand curve on which the quantity demanded is not very sensitive to changes in price. So, if the demand curve is price inelastic, consumers are not very responsive to changes in price. This means that an excise tax will have a smaller effect on the price that consumers pay.\nA price elastic supply curve is a supply curve on which the quantity supplied is sensitive to changes in price. So, if the supply curve is price elastic, producers are highly responsive to changes in price. This means that an excise tax will have a larger effect on the price that consumers pay.\nA perfectly elastic supply curve is a supply curve on which the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. So, if the supply curve is perfectly elastic, producers are able to produce a large quantity of the good, but the tax will not affect the price that consumers pay.\nA price inelastic supply curve is a supply curve on which the quantity supplied is not very sensitive to changes in price. So, if the supply curve is price inelastic, producers are not very responsive to changes in price. This means that an excise tax will have a smaller effect on the price that consumers pay.\nSOLUTION: An excise tax placed on a producer will increase the cost of production. This increase in cost will be passed on to consumers in the form of a higher price.\nIf the demand curve is price elastic and the supply curve is price inelastic, the larger of the two prices will be the one that results in consumers paying for the largest burden of the excise tax.\nThe larger price will be the one that is more sensitive to changes in the cost of production. Since the demand curve is price elastic, a change in price will have a larger effect on the quantity demanded than a change in price will have on the quantity supplied. So, the demand curve is more sensitive to changes in the cost of production."}

{"question": "In order for a firm to successfully carry out price discrimination, which of the following conditions must hold? I. The firm cannot face a downward sloping demand curve. II.

The firm must be able to prevent the re-sale of its products.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "I, III, and V only"}, {"label": "B", "text": "III and IV only"}, {"label": "C", "text": "I and IV only"}, {"label": "D", "text": "II, III, and V only"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Price discrimination involves charging different prices to different buyers for the same product. To do this successfully, the firm must be able to separate buyers by their willingness to pay. This is condition III.\nBuyers with different levels of price sensitivity may have different willingness to pay. This means that they are separable. This is condition III.\nPreventing buyers from re-selling the product, as in condition V, can help keep the market from slipping away from the firm. This can help the firm maintain its power to charge different prices. But, as with increasing production, it is not a necessary condition for price discrimination to work.\nHaving a downward sloping demand curve, as in condition I, tells you that higher quantity sellers face a lower price. This means that the demand is elastic. To successfully price discriminate, the firm must be able to capture the difference between the higher price that elastic buyers are willing to pay and the lower price that inelastic buyers are willing to pay. This requires that the firm be able to identify buyers and distinguish their level of price sensitivity. So, condition I is not a sufficient condition.\nHaving market power, as in condition II, means that the firm can charge a higher price than in a competitive market. This helps make price discrimination possible. But, having market power does not require that the firm engage in price discrimination. So, having market power is not a sufficient condition.\nHaving motives beyond profit maximization, as in condition IV, does not help ensure that the firm will successfully price discriminate. Whether the firm successfully price discriminates does not depend on its motives. It depends on whether the firm can capture the difference in price sensitivity between different buyers."}

One example of a monopoly is a utility company.\nA utility company has a straight, downward-sloping demand curve. This means that as the price of utilities increases, the quantity demanded decreases. But because the utility company is a monopoly, it has the power to set the price. So, the monopoly can charge a price that clears the market: it covers the marginal cost of the last unit sold.\nThe marginal revenue curve shows how the monopoly's revenue changes as the price changes. Since the monopoly has power in the market, it can keep raising the price until it reaches the maximum price that customers are willing to pay. At that price, the marginal revenue curve is equal to the demand curve.\nThe marginal revenue curve is upward sloping. This means that the monopoly's revenue is higher when it raises the price.\nThe monopoly's marginal revenue curve is parallel to the demand curve. So, the marginal revenue curve is upward sloping."}

When the government sets a price floor, it tries to dictate a price that buyers are willing to pay.\nA price floor can result in a persistent shortage of the good. When the price of a good is below the price floor, people will buy more of the good than they would have at the equilibrium price. This leads to a shortage of the good.\nA price floor can also result in a persistent surplus of the good. When the price of a good is above the equilibrium price, people will buy less of the good than they would have at the equilibrium price. This leads to a surplus of the good.\nEliminating deadweight loss is one of the reasons governments may choose to set price floors. When there is a price floor, some buyers and sellers are unable to trade. This is called a distortion. Eliminating this distortion, or deadweight loss, is one of the reasons price floors may be created.\nA price floor may increase total welfare. This happens when the price floor is set below the equilibrium price. The price floor leads to a shortage of the good, which increases the price of the good.

As a result, the quantity of the product demanded is equal to the quantity of the product supplied.\nIf the government places a price ceiling above the equilibrium price, it is impossible for the market to reach this price. This creates a shortage of the product. The quantity of the product demanded is higher than the quantity of the product supplied.\nIf the government places a price floor below the equilibrium price, it is impossible for the market to reach this price.

It is a measure of the value that consumers place on a good.\nTo increase consumer surplus, the Reds must increase the value of the tickets without increasing the price. The value of the tickets is determined by the production costs of the game plus the additional value that the consumers place on the experience of watching the Reds play.\nThe cost of producing a ticket is the cost of the players, the cost of the stadium, and the cost of the hot dogs. The Reds must increase the value of the game experience by adding more value-added features, such as discounted parking, more entertaining concessions, or better player performance.\nIncreasing the value of the game experience is the key to increasing consumer surplus. Traffic jams and highway construction projects do not affect the value of the game experience. Charging more for hot dogs does not increase the value of the game experience."}

For some firms, the price is set by the market. For other firms, the price is set by negotiations. In either case, the firm will want to choose an output level that maximizes its revenue.\nOne of the key concepts in economics is the relationship between revenue and cost. For a firm, the total cost of production includes the cost of all inputs, including labor. The total revenue of the firm is the price it receives for its output minus the cost of the inputs.\nSo, for a firm to maximum its profits, it will choose to produce an output level where total revenue equals total cost. In other words, the firm will choose to produce an output level where:\nMR = AVC\nWhere:\nMR is the market rent, or the price a firm would charge if it could set its own price. MR is a measure of the maximum revenue a firm can earn.\nAVC is the average variable cost, or the cost of each additional unit of output. AVC is a measure of the cost to the firm of producing one more unit of output.\nSOLUTION: To maximize its profits, a firm will choose an output level where MC = AFC. This means that the marginal cost is equal to the average fixed cost.\nThe marginal cost is the cost of the additional inputs needed to produce one more unit of output.\nThe average fixed cost is the total cost of production divided by the output level.\nSo, MC = AFC means that the cost of each additional unit is equal to the average cost of producing each unit."}

Then, identify the output level where the total cost is equal to the average revenue. This output level will give the monopolist the highest average total cost.\nThe monopolist's profit-maximizing strategy may involve setting the price of the good above marginal cost. This creates allocative inefficiency, which occurs when the price of a good does not reflect its true social cost.\nSOLUTION: When a monopolist has maximized profit, it is setting the price of the good equal to marginal cost, creating zero economic profit.

This means that the price is equal to the minimum average total cost.\nIf the perfectly competitive price is currently below minimum average total cost, this means that the price needs to rise for the industry to produce at the minimum average total cost. If the price rises, each firm's output will fall as it exits the industry.\nSo, in the long run, a price rise will lead to each firm's exit from the industry. This will cause the industry to move to a new long-run equilibrium at a higher price and a lower quantity.\nThere is one case in which a price rise will not lead to firms exiting the industry:\nIf the price rises to the breakeven point, then each firm will stay in the industry. But in this case, the price will not fall back below the breakeven point in the future, so the industry will stay in its long-run equilibrium.\nIf the price is currently above the breakeven point, then firms will exit the industry. This will cause the price to fall to the breakeven point.\nIf the price is currently at the breakeven point, then nothing happens in the long run. The industry is already in its long-run equilibrium.\nIf the price is currently below the breakeven point, then firms will exit the industry. This will cause the price to rise to the breakeven point.\nSOLUTION: If the perfectly competitive price is currently below minimum average total cost, then the price needs to rise for the industry to produce at the minimum average total cost.

Price discrimination can increase a firm's profits by allowing the firm to charge each consumer the amount that the consumer is willing to pay.\nOne way that price discrimination can increase profits is by charging market segments with relatively elastic demand higher prices. Since these market segments have elastic demand, they are more sensitive to prices. Thus, by charging them higher prices, the firm can increase its profit per unit without decreasing the total quantity demanded.\nOn the other hand, market segments with relatively inelastic demand pay lower prices. Since these market segments are less sensitive to prices, a price decrease may not result in an increase in the quantity demanded. Therefore, charging them lower prices could actually decrease the firm's profit per unit.\nSOLUTION: When the opportunity for price discrimination arises, market segments with relatively elastic demand pay higher prices. This increases the firm's profit per unit, since these consumers are willing to pay more."}

If price elasticity of demand is highly elastic, it means that a small change in price will cause a large change in the quantity demanded.\nSo, if the price elasticity of demand is highly elastic, consumers are highly sensitive to changes in price. This means that if the supplier passes on the tax to the consumer in the form of a higher price, the consumer is likely to buy much less of the good or service than before. This leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded and a decrease in the producer's revenue.\nOn the other hand, if the price elasticity of demand is highly inelastic, it means that a small change in price will cause a small change in the quantity demanded. So, if the supplier passes on the tax to the consumer in the form of a higher price, the consumer is likely to continue buying much of the good or service, as the change in price is not very significant. This leads to a decrease in the producer's revenue.\nThe wage elasticity of demand is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good or service responds to a change in the wages of the consumers. It is different from the price elasticity of demand, which measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in the price of the good or service.\nUnit elasticity of demand is a special case of elasticity, where the quantity demanded is unchanged at the new price. This means that consumers are highly sensitive to changes in price, but the consumer's ability to purchase the good or service at the higher price is limited."}

A price floor is a limit on the price that can be charged for a product.\nWhat happens if prices rise above the price ceiling?\nIf prices rise above the price ceiling, the quantity of goods or services sold will decrease. This decrease in the quantity of goods sold is a decrease in the supply of goods.\nWhat happens if prices fall below the price floor?\nIf prices fall below the price floor, the quantity of goods or services sold will increase. This increase in the quantity of goods sold is an increase in the supply of goods.\nGovernments sometimes use price ceilings to try to control the price of goods and services. For example, the government might set a price ceiling on the price of gasoline.\nIf the price of gasoline rises above the price ceiling, the quantity of gasoline sold will decrease. This decrease in the quantity of gasoline sold is a decrease in the supply of gasoline. Since the supply of gasoline decreased, the price of gasoline will eventually rise back up to the price ceiling.\nIf the price of gasoline falls below the price floor, the quantity of gasoline sold will increase. This increase in the quantity of gasoline sold is an increase in the supply of gasoline. Since the supply of gasoline increased, the price of gasoline will eventually fall back down to the price floor.\nSOLUTION: A price ceiling is used to control the price of a product. It is not used to correct government policy.\nA price ceiling will be located below the equilibrium price.\nEquilibrium prices are the prices at which the quantity of goods or services sold equals the quantity desired. These prices can be determined by looking at the interaction of supply and demand.\nIf a price ceiling is located below the equilibrium price, the quantity of goods or services sold will exceed the quantity desired. This excess demand will cause the price to rise above the price ceiling."}

This means that the price is not elastic. If the price were elastic, the quantity demanded would have fallen more than the price had risen.\nSince the price is not elastic, the demand for beef is price inelastic.\nHowever, we do know that the quantity demanded of a good is inversely proportional to its price. So, if the price rises, the quantity demanded will generally fall.\nThus, we can conclude that consumer spending on beef is falling."}

For example, the pollution from a factory is an externality, because the pollution harms others who do not make the decision to pollute.\nWhen externalities occur, there is a risk of under- or over-production. For example, if the owners of factories are not responsible for the pollution that their factories produce, they may choose to pollute more than they would if they were responsible for the pollution. This could lead to over-production of pollution, which could harm others. On the other hand, if the owners of factories are responsible for the pollution that their factories produce, they may choose to pollute less than they would if they were not responsible for the pollution. This could lead to under-production of pollution, which could harm the owners of the factories.\nSubsidies and taxes can be used to deal with externalities. Subsidies can be used to increase the production of good things, such as education. Taxes can be used to decrease the production of bad things, such as pollution.\nSOLUTION: Education provides benefits to others, not just to the person who receives the education. This is called a positive externality.\nTo estimate the social value of the externality, consider how much more Chris is willing to pay for the good thing that results from the education. This is called the private marginal benefit. The social value is the private marginal benefit plus the value of the externality to other people.\nThe social value of the externality is greater than the private marginal benefit. So, education provides a positive externality, and it would be worth subsidizing to increase its production."}

In the case of a positive externality, the social marginal benefit of the good is higher than the private marginal benefit.\nWhen there is a positive externality associated with the production of a private good, the market will produce less of the good than is socially optimal. This is because the firm will not receive payment for the external benefit.\nThere are a variety of ways that a government can move a market from an inefficient outcome to an efficient one. One of the most effective ways is to use a tax or a subsidy.\nA tax on the firm will reduce the firm's profits. This tax will equal the value of the externality. By reducing the firm's profits, the tax will equal the social marginal cost of the externality. This will increase the firm's incentive to produce the good, which will also increase the amount of the good that is produced.\nA subsidy to the firm or its customers will increase the firm's profits. This subsidy will equal the value of the externality. By increasing the firm's profits, the subsidy will equal the social marginal benefit of the externality. This will increase the firm's incentive to produce the good, which will also increase the amount of the good that is produced.\nAppointing a commission is not a good way to move a market to an efficient outcome.

So, luxuries, necessities, substitutes, and complements are all affected by changes in the price of another good.\nSOLUTION: A positive sign on cross price elasticity of demand indicates that the two products are complements.\nWhen the price of one complement increases, people buy more of the other complement to use with it. For example, when the price of pizza increases, people might buy more soda to go with their pizza.\nThe other categories are as follows:\nA luxury is a good for which demand decreases when income decreases. So, luxuries are not complements.\nA necessity is a good for which demand does not decrease when income decreases.

It can be used to predict how much a change in price will affect the quantity demanded.\nThe price elasticity of demand is greater if the proportion of the good of the consumer's budget is high. This means that if a good is a larger part of a consumer's budget, a change in the price of that good will affect the quantity demanded more than if the good is a smaller part of the consumer's budget.\nThe period of time that a consumer has to respond to a price change is an important factor in determining the price elasticity of demand. The shorter the period of time, the more responsive the quantity demanded is to a price change. This is because the consumer has less time to adjust their buying behavior.\nThe number of substitute products is an important factor in determining the price elasticity of demand. A product with more substitute products is considered more elastic, because a change in the price of a product with many substitutes will affect the quantity demanded more than a change in the price of a product with few substitutes.\nA product is a necessity if it is considered an essential purchase. The price elasticity of demand is greater for necessities than for luxuries. This is because the purchase of a necessity is more sensitive to changes in price than the purchase of a luxury.\nSOLUTION: The text states that the price elasticity of demand is greater if the proportion of the good of the consumer's budget is high. So, if a product is a necessity, the price elasticity of demand is greater than if the product is a luxury."}

The law of increasing costs tells you about how the cost of producing a good changes as the quantity produced increases. But the marginal benefit curve shows how the benefit of an additional unit of a good changes as the price of the good changes. So, the marginal benefit curve and the law of increasing costs do not describe the same thing.\nA linear production possibility frontier is a set of outputs that a country can produce with its available resources. The frontier shows the maximum output that can be produced with a certain amount of resources. The shape of a production possibility frontier is determined by the opportunities for trade that are available to a country. So, the shape of a production possibility frontier does not depend on the costs of producing a good.\nA concave production possibility frontier is a set of outputs that a country can produce with its available resources. The frontier is concave, which means that it is bowed inward. This shape shows that countries can produce more goods by specializing and trading. The shape of a production possibility frontier is determined by the opportunities for trade that are available to a country.

In either case, the firm can charge a higher price than in a competitive market.\nOne reason monopolies can charge a higher price is that they are the only game in town. This means that buyers have no other choice but to buy from the monopoly. Since buyers have no other choice, they are willing to pay a higher price to buy the product or service from the monopoly.\nAnother reason monopolies can charge a higher price is that, in some cases, they have access to economies of scale. Economies of scale are costs that are lower when a firm produces more.\nMonopolies can also make a profit by charging a lower price and using economies of scale to reduce their average total cost.\nSOLUTION: When a monopoly produces at the allocatively efficient quantity, it is producing the quantity that balances the monopoly's marginal cost and marginal revenue.\nThe monopoly sets its price equal to its marginal cost. So, at the allocatively efficient quantity, the monopoly breaks even \u2013 it does not make a profit or a loss."}

But it also faces significant competition from other firms. So, it can charge slightly higher prices than it would in a perfectly competitive market, but it still has to be careful not to charge too much or it will lose customers to its competitors.\nOne of the characteristics of monopolistic competition is that firms in the industry have excess capacity. This means that they can produce more goods than they are expected to sell in a given period. This excess capacity gives firms some bargaining power when it comes time to set prices.\nSOLUTION: Look at the definition of excess capacity. It means that firms in the industry can produce more than they are expected to sell. This means that they have some ability to increase production in the future.\nA monopolistically competitive firm pricing at minimum ATC in the long run is an example of how excess capacity can affect pricing. Minimum ATC is the minimum amount a firm must charge to cover its average total cost. By pricing at minimum ATC, a firm is ensuring that it is not charging too much. But it is also setting a price that is slightly below what it could charge if it did not have excess capacity. So, excess capacity puts downward pressure on prices in a monopolistically competitive industry.\nEconomically efficient in the long run and very few competitors are not characteristics of monopolistic competition. An economically efficient industry is one in which firms are able to produce at the lowest average cost. This can happen in a monopolistically competitive industry, but it is not a characteristic of the industry.\nA characteristic of a monopolistically competitive industry is that there are very few competitors in the industry. But the exact number of competitors is not specified."}

When the government sets a price ceiling below the market equilibrium price, the supply exceeds the demand. When the government sets a price ceiling above the market equilibrium price, the demand exceeds the supply.\nWhen a price ceiling is set below the market equilibrium price, the quantity of the good that the buyers are willing to purchase at the ceiling price is greater than the quantity that the sellers are willing to sell. This creates a shortage of the good.\nWhen a price ceiling is set above the market equilibrium price, the quantity of the good that the sellers are willing to sell at the ceiling price is greater than the quantity that the buyers are willing to purchase. This creates a surplus of the good.\nA shift of the demand curve represents a change in the willingness of buyers to purchase a good at different prices. This change can occur because of a change in the buyers' tastes, incomes, or prices of related goods. A shift of the demand curve can occur without a change in the market equilibrium price.\nA shift of the supply curve represents a change in the willingness of sellers to sell a good at different prices. This change can occur because of a change in the sellers' tastes, incomes, or prices of related goods. A shift of the supply curve can occur without a change in the market equilibrium price.\nSOLUTION: A price ceiling is characterized by a price set below the current (or equilibrium) market price of the good."}
{"question": "Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, and tutors David for two hours.

This process of negotiating a price is called pricing in competitive markets.\nPricing in competitive markets leads to a competitive price, or a price that is fair to both buyers and sellers. This competitive price is the price where consumer surplus is maximized and producer surplus is maximized.\nTo find the competitive price, buyers and sellers negotiate back and forth. Buyers argue that they are willing to pay a high price. Sellers argue that they are willing to accept a high price. The competitive price is the price that results in consumer surplus being equal to producer surplus.\nAt the competitive price, consumer surplus is maximized and producer surplus is maximized. This means that the value of the goods to the buyers is equal to the cost of the goods to the sellers.\nConsumer surplus is the difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay and the competitive price. Producer surplus is the difference between the competitive price and the lowest price a producer is willing to accept.\nSOLUTION: David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but they negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours. This means that the competitive price is $125.\nConsumer surplus is the difference between the highest price David is willing to pay and the competitive price. The highest price David is willing to pay is $175. So, consumer surplus is $175 - $125 = $50.\nProducer surplus is the difference between the competitive price and the lowest price Elsa is willing to accept. The lowest price Elsa is willing to accept is between $50 and $75 per hour. So, producer surplus is $125 - $50 = $75."}

{"question": "For a competitive firm, what is the most important thing to consider in deciding whether to shut down in the short run?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Compare AVC to MR."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Compare TR to TC."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Do not produce if the TFC is not covered by revenue."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Produce the highest quantity demanded regardless of price."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: A competitive firm should shut down if producing the next unit would cause the average total cost (ATC) to exceed the average revenue per unit (AR). The ATC includes the TC and AF.\nTC = TFC + TVC\nATC = TC + AF\nTo decide whether to shut down, compare ATC to AR.\nProduce the highest quantity demanded regardless of price is incorrect.\nProducing the highest quantity demanded may not cover the ATC.\nCompare TR to TC. To compare TR to TC, look at the TR and TC graphs. The TR starts from the ATC. The TC is the maximum amount the firm can spend to produce an additional unit. So, the TR slopes downward from the TC.\nProduce the highest quantity demanded regardless of price is incorrect.\nProducing the highest quantity demanded may not cover the ATC.\nCompare AVC to MR. To compare AVC to MR, look at the AVC and MR graphs. The AVC is the minimum ATC for a given level of output. The MR is the maximum price the market will bear. So, the AVC and MR determine the maximum quantity that the firm should produce to cover its costs.\nDo not produce if the TFC is not covered by revenue is incorrect.\nThis decision rule does not consider the firm's costs."}

This indicates that in the long run, the market is not allocatively efficient.\nA monopolistically competitive firm can earn economic profits in the long run by spending money to differentiate and advertise its products. This can make the firm's products more attractive to buyers.\nIf a monopolistically competitive firm spends money to differentiate and advertise its products, the firm will increase its sales.

{"question": "The supply curve for lawn-mowing services is likely to slope upward because of", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "decreasing marginal costs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "increasing opportunity cost of time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "diminishing marginal utility"}, {"label": "D", "text": "increasing returns to scale"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A supply curve shows how the price of a good or service affects the quantity that sellers are willing to supply. The supply curve slopes upward, which means that an increase in the price of the good or service leads to an increase in the quantity that sellers are willing to supply.\nThere are several reasons why the supply curve for a good or service might slope upward. One of the reasons is increasing returns to scale. Increasing returns to scale occur when the quantity of inputs is increased. As the quantity of inputs is increased, the output of the good or service also increases. This means that, for each additional unit of the good or service produced, more than one additional unit is produced. As a result, the supply curve slopes upward.\nAnother reason why the supply curve might slope upward is increasing opportunity cost of time. The opportunity cost of time is the value of the time that a seller could have earned by doing something else instead of supplying the good or service. If the price of the good or service increases, the seller may be willing to spend more time supplying the good or service, which increases the quantity supplied. This means that, for each additional unit of the good or service produced, more time is spent producing it. As a result, the supply curve slopes upward.\nDecreasing marginal costs and diminishing marginal utility are reasons why the supply curve might slope downward.\nDimaining marginal utility is a concept that can be difficult to understand. It refers to the fact that people tend to want more of a good or service as long as the marginal utility of that good or service is greater than the price of the good or service. As the price of the good or service increases, the marginal utility of each additional unit decreases. This means that the quantity demanded decreases. So, the supply curve must slope downward to keep the quantity supplied equal to the quantity demanded.\nDecreasing marginal costs mean that each additional unit of the good or service has a lower and lower per-unit cost. This means that the supply curve must slope downward to keep the quantity supplied equal to the quantity demanded.\nSOLUTION: Increasing returns to scale occur when the quantity of inputs is increased. As the quantity of inputs is increased, the output of the good or service also increases. This means that, for each additional unit of the good or service produced, more than one additional unit is produced. As a result, the supply curve slopes upward."}

Resources include not only the factors of production (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship), but also the products that are produced.\nMarket economies use prices to ration allocation of resources. Prices can influence the quantity of a good that is produced. For example, a higher price for a good will encourage more of that good to be produced.\nSOLUTION: Inputs to the production process are factors of production. Factors of production are used to produce goods and services. For example, labor is a factor of production. Land, capital, and entrepreneurship are other examples of factors of production.\nOutputs are the products that are produced. Prices influence the quantity of a good that is produced. For example, a higher price for a good will increase the quantity of that good that is produced.\nPublic goods are goods that are provided by the government. Consumers do not have to pay for public goods. For example, national defense is a public good.\nInferior goods are goods for which demand decreases when income increases. For example, when income increases, people might decide to buy fewer bags of potato chips."}

{"question": "The downward-sloping demand curve is partially explained by which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Substitution effects and income effects"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The law of increasing marginal costs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The principle of comparative advantage"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The law of diminishing marginal returns to production"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A change in the quantity demanded is determined by both the change in the price of a good and the change in consumers' income.\nThese changes in the quantity demanded are called the income effect and the substitution effect, respectively.\nThe income effect is a result of the change in consumers' income. When the price of a good changes, the quantity demanded of the good will change, which in turn affects consumers' income. The income effect is a change in the quantity demanded due to a change in consumers' income.\nThe substitution effect is a result of the change in the price of a good. When the price of a good changes, the quantity demanded of the good will change, which in turn affects the quantity demanded of other goods. The substitution effect is a change in the quantity demanded due to a change in the price of a good.\nSOLUTION: The downward-sloping demand curve is partially explained by the income effect and the substitution effect.\nThe income effect tells you that, when the price of a good changes, the quantity demanded of the good will change, and this change in the quantity demanded will affect consumers' income. The substitution effect tells you that, when the price of a good changes, the quantity demanded of the good will change, and this change in the quantity demanded will affect the quantity demanded of other goods.\nBoth the income effect and the substitution effect can cause the quantity demanded to change. When these two effects are balanced, they cancel each other out, and the demand curve is flat. When the income effect is larger than the substitution effect, the demand curve is downward-sloping.\nThe law of increasing marginal costs is a result of the fact that, as a firm produces more goods, each additional good requires more resources. This means that the cost of producing each good is higher for a firm with higher production volume than for a firm with lower production volume.\nThe principle of comparative advantage is a principle that applies to trade between countries. It states that a country should produce and export goods for which it has a comparative advantage, and import and consume goods for which it does not have a comparative advantage.\nThe law of diminishing marginal returns to production is a result of the fact that, as a firm produces more goods, each additional good requires more resources. This means that, at some point, the additional benefit from producing one more good will be outweighed by the additional cost."}

When a market is organized by a cartel, the cartel firms can use their control over the market to maximize their collective profits.\nOne of the potential consequences of a cartel is that it may attract firms that are willing to cheat on the cartel agreement. This can happen because each firm in the cartel can earn more money by producing and selling more units than the cartel agreement specifies. If some firms cheat, then the cartel's ability to affect the market will be reduced.\nAnother potential consequence of a cartel is that it may lead to inefficiencies in the allocation of resources. This can happen when the cartel sets prices or limits on production.\nIf a cartel is successful in reducing competition, it may lead to higher prices and lower quantities sold than would be optimal for consumers. This means that the cartel may not lead to allocative efficiency.\nHowever, a cartel can also lead to profit maximization by individual firms in the cartel. This happens when each firm in the cartel is able to earn more money by participating in the cartel than it could by trying to maximize its profits outside of the cartel.\nFinally, a cartel can lead to normal profits for all cartel firms. This happens when each firm in the cartel is able to earn a profit that is above its opportunity cost but below the level that would be earned in a perfectly competitive market."}

If the annual price of capital increases, the firm's short-run cost curves will shift upward.\nThe marginal cost curve will shift upward. The marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit of a good or service. An increase in the annual price of capital will increase the marginal cost of production.\nThe average fixed cost curve will shift upward. The average fixed cost is the fixed cost per unit of production.

{"question": "Which of the following is true about a price floor?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is used to correct government policy."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is used when the equilibrium price is too high."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It will be located above the equilibrium price."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It will be located below the equilibrium price."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A price floor is a government-set minimum price. A price floor can be set for goods, services, or anything else.\nA price floor can become a shortage. If the price of a good is set too high, people will not buy as much of the good as they would if the price were lower. So, a price floor can cause a shortage.\nAn excess demand of 100 units is a shortage of 100 units. If the price floor is set too high, people will buy only 80 units instead of the 100 units they would buy if the price were lower. This means that 20 units are in excess of the price floor.\nA shortage can happen even if the price is above the price floor. This is because the price floor is setting a maximum price that buyers are willing to pay. If the price is higher than the price floor, buyers will not purchase as much as they would if the price were equal to the price floor.\nA price floor can be used to help producers. A price floor can increase the price that producers receive for their products. This can help producers cover their higher costs or earn a higher profit.\nSOLUTION: A price floor is used to correct government policy. A price floor can be set to correct a situation in which the market is not working well. For example, a price floor might be set to keep prices from rising too quickly.\nA price floor will be located below the equilibrium price. An equilibrium price is a price at which the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. So, a price floor will be set below the equilibrium price.\nA price floor will not cause a shortage if it is set below the equilibrium price. This is because the price floor is below the equilibrium price. So, the price in the market will be equal to the price floor. The quantity demanded will equal the quantity supplied, and there will not be a shortage.\nA price floor will cause a shortage if it is set above the equilibrium price. This is because the price floor is above the equilibrium price. So, the price in the market will be equal to the price floor. The quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied, and a shortage will occur."}

In a monopoly, the seller has the power to set the price and determine the quantity of the product that is sold.\nMonopolistic competition is a type of market in which a large number of firms sell products that are similar but not identical. In a monopolistically competitive market, each firm has some control over price, but the market is not a monopoly.\nAn oligopoly is a market in which a few firms dominate the market. In an oligopoly, each firm has some control over the price and the quantity of the product that is sold.\nSOLUTION: In a monopoly market, the seller has the power to set the price and determine the quantity of the product that is sold. In this case, the seller will set the price at the level where the additional revenue equals the additional cost. This is the point on the curve where the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue.\nAt a monopoly's profit-maximizing level of production, P = MC. So, in a monopoly market, P > MC.\nDeadweight loss occurs in a monopoly market. When a monopoly charges a price higher than the social optimum, consumers buy less than the social optimum quantity. Producers also produce less than the social optimum quantity. So, the deadweight loss occurs from the difference between the social optimum quantity and the quantity bought and sold by the monopoly.\nAn oligopoly is a market in which a few firms dominate the market. In an oligopoly, each firm has some control over the price and the quantity of the product that is sold.\nIn an oligopoly, each firm wants to consider the reaction of other firms to its own pricing and output decisions. If firms set prices and outputs independently, they may compete away from each other. So, oligopoly firms may choose to coordinate their pricing and output decisions.\nThis coordination can take the form of a formal agreement or an informal understanding among the firms. For example, the firms may agree to charge the same price, or they may agree to produce a specific quantity.\nSOLUTION: Oligopoly firms may choose to set prices and outputs that result in a deadweight loss. The magnitude of this deadweight loss is determined by the degree of price and output coordination among the firms.\nIf firms in an oligopoly are able to coordinate their pricing and output decisions, they may be able to generate a higher price and greater quantity than they could as monopolies. In this case, the deadweight loss from oligopoly competition is less than the deadweight loss from monopoly.\nIf firms in an oligopoly are not able to coordinate their pricing and output decisions, the competition between them may result in a lower price and a smaller quantity than the firms could achieve as monopolies. In this case, the deadweight loss from oligopoly competition is greater than the deadweight loss from monopoly."}

Free riders are a challenge for public goods. A free rider is someone who receives a benefit from a good or service without paying for it. In the case of public goods, the benefit is obtained by all members of society, so in this case, the free rider is simply someone who enjoys the benefit without paying for it.\nII. Adding demand curves vertically to find the demand curve for society is a method for calculating the optimal provision of a public good. It is not associated with public goods.\nIII. Nonrivalry in consumption is a property of public goods. This property ensures that the good is used by many people without reducing its availability to others.\nIV.

Non-excludable means that it is impossible to exclude consumers from the benefits of the good. Non-rivalrous means that one consumer's use of the good does not diminish the availability of the good for other consumers.\nPure public goods are both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that one more unit of a public good for some consumers means one less unit for no one. In other words, the consumption of a pure public good by one consumer does not reduce the consumption of the good by other consumers.\nSOLUTION: A pure public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. One more unit of a public good for some consumers means one less unit for no one. So, the marginal cost of providing an additional unit of the good to additional consumers is zero."}

At this point, the average product of labor is equal to the marginal product of labor times the average wage.\nSo, the maximum output of the firm is the output that yields the highest average profits.\nAP rises when MP is above it and falls when MP is below it.\nWhen the marginal product of labor is above the average product of labor, the additional output from hiring another worker increases the average product of labor. So, the average product of labor rises.\nWhen the marginal product of labor is below the average product of labor, hiring another worker would decrease the average product of labor. So, the average product of labor falls.\nAP and MP are always parallel to each other.\nIf AP rises, MP also rises. And if AP falls, MP also falls.\nAP and MP are either both rising or both falling at all levels of labor.\nAt any level of labor, the maximum output is the output that yields the highest average profits.

Other factors reflect the preferences of workers, such as a desire to work in a certain location.\nSOLUTION: Immobility of workers refers to the fact that some workers are unwilling or unable to move to a new location to take a job. This lack of mobility can lead to wage differentials, as employers may be willing to pay higher wages to attract workers who are willing to move. But immobility is not a source of wage differentials in the sense that it does not explain why some workers are paid higher wages than others.\nThe decrease in the birth rate refers to a decrease in the number of babies being born. This birth rate decrease is not a source of wage differentials, as it does not explain why some workers are paid higher wages than others.\nRacial or gender discrimination refers to the practice of paying lower wages to workers based on their race or gender.

An effective price ceiling in the market for a good likely results in one of the following outcomes:\nA persistent surplus is a situation in which the quantity of a good that is offered for sale exceeds the quantity that buyers are willing to purchase at the ceiling price. In this case, the price cannot rise above the ceiling, and the good may go to waste.\nA persistent shortage is a situation in which the quantity of a good that is offered for sale is less than the quantity that buyers are willing to purchase at the ceiling price. In this case, the price cannot fall below the ceiling, and buyers may be unable to purchase the good at any price.\nAn increase in the demand for a substitute good is a situation in which buyers switch to a different good when the price of the primary good is below the ceiling. This can occur even if the price of the substitute good is higher than the price of the primary good.\nA decrease in the demand for a complement good is a situation in which buyers reduce their use of a good when the price of the primary good is below the ceiling. This can occur even if the price of the complement good is lower than the price of the primary good.\nSOLUTION: A price ceiling below the market equilibrium price leads to a shortage of good X. The shortage causes the price of good Y, a substitute for good X, to increase. The increase in the price of good Y does not affect the quantity of good Y that buyers are willing to purchase. But the increase in the price of good Y does affect the quantity of good X that buyers are willing to purchase.

So, a decrease in price causes a decrease in quantity demanded and an upward-sloping demand curve.\nThe income effect tells you how much the consumer's change in income affects the quantity demanded of a good. The substitution effect tells you how much the change in the price of a good affects the quantity demanded of a good.\nIf the good is normal, the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect. So, a price decrease causes a decrease in quantity demanded, but the demand curve is still upward-sloping.\nIf the good is inferior, the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect. So, a price decrease causes a decrease in quantity demanded, but the demand curve is still upward-sloping.\nIf the good is normal and the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect, the demand curve is downward-sloping.

This decrease in marginal utility is a result of diminishing marginal utility.\nThe Fisher effect deals with the relationship between interest rates and the exchange rate of a currency. It states that a decrease in interest rates in one country will be accompanied by an increase in the demand for that country's currency, which will cause the exchange rate to appreciate. This appreciation of the exchange rate will decrease the price of imports, which will increase the demand for exports. As a result, the demand for goods and services in the country will increase, leading to an outward shift of the demand curve.\nDimishing returns to scale occur when the output of a firm increases, but the firm's marginal output decreases.

A kinked demand curve is a demand curve that is flat in a particular price range.\nIn a kinked demand curve, the quantity demanded does not change within the range of prices that is flatter than the rest of the curve. This means that the demand curve is of one continuous function within this range of prices.\nSOLUTION: A price leader is a firm that sets its price first, and other firms follow its price. In the context of a kinked demand curve, a price leader can cause a change in the price and quantity demanded within the range of prices that is flatter than the rest of the curve.\nThere are relatively equal shares of the market within the range of prices that is flatter than the rest of the curve. This means that the quantity demanded does not change within this range of prices.\nPrice is greater than marginal costs within the range of prices that is flatter than the rest of the curve. This means that the kinked demand curve does not represent a demand curve for a market in which all firms have marginal costs equal to the market price."}

A long-run price that exceeds average total cost. In the long run, a monopolistically competitive firm can drive its competitors out of business by setting a price that exceeds their average total cost. This leaves the firm with a monopoly, and it can then raise its price and decrease its output to maximize its profits.\nB. A price that exceeds average variable cost, causing excess capacity. In the short run, a monopolistically competitive firm may not be able to drive its competitors out of business by setting a price that exceeds their average total cost. Instead, the firm may have to settle for a price that exceeds its average variable cost, which will leave it with some excess capacity. This excess capacity can indicate that the market is not being completely utilized.\nC. Many resources devoted to advertising. In the short run, a firm in a monopolistically competitive market may increase its sales by devoting more resources to advertising. This can help the firm differentiate its product from those of its competitors. But in the long run, advertising can be a expensive and may not be sustainable.\nD. Strong barriers to entry. Strong barriers to entry are not characteristic of monopolistic competition. They are characteristic of a monopoly. In a monopoly, a firm is the only one in the market. Strong barriers to entry can include patents, trademarks, or regulatory restrictions that prevent other firms from entering the market."}

The marginal cost of an activity is the change in overall cost that results from an increase in the quantity of that activity.\nBecause the student is considering spending an additional hour studying, the marginal benefit of that hour is the change in the student's overall benefit from studying that is associated with that additional hour. The marginal cost of that hour is the change in the student's overall cost from studying that is associated with that additional hour.\nTo determine which number is greater, consider which factor is larger: the marginal benefit or the marginal cost.

An excise tax can be passed on to consumers in the form of a higher price.\nThe demand curve shows how much of a good people are willing to buy at different prices. The elasticity of the demand curve is a measure of how much the quantity demanded responds to changes in price.\nSOLUTION: An excise tax is imposed on the production of good X. This tax increases the cost of producing good X. As a result, the price of good X rises by the amount of the tax.\nThe demand curve is less elastic if it shows a more negative response to changes in price. So, if the demand curve is less elastic, the consumer's burden of the tax rises. This means that the consumer pays more of the tax.\nIf the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price rises by the amount of the tax. In this case, the consumer's burden of the tax is zero.\nConsumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the market price. As the price rises due to the tax, consumer surplus rises."}

This problem can arise when people are asked to pay for public goods or to help solve commons problems.\nOne solution to the free rider problem is to provide more complete information about the relevant goods. This can help potential free riders understand how their actions affect the group. For example, if people understand how air pollution affects breathing, they are more likely to support policies that reduce pollution.\nAnother solution is to tax those creating negative externalities. A negative externality is a cost that is created by one person but is paid by another person. For example, the pollution that is created by a company can make people sick, which can lead to higher medical costs for the community. A tax can be used to cover the costs of the negative externality.\nSupplying public goods using tax dollars is another way to address the free rider problem. A public good is a good that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that people cannot be excluded from using the good, and using the good by one person does not reduce its availability to others. National defense is an example of a public good.\nEnacting stricter antitrust legislation is not directly related to addressing the free rider problem. Antitrust legislation is designed to promote competition by preventing monopolies and market domination."}

A price floor is a legal limit on the price that can be charged for a good or service.\nPrice ceilings are designed to help consumers. By setting a maximum price, a price ceiling prevents sellers from charging excessively high prices. This can be especially helpful for goods and services that are essential to people's well-being, such as medical care or housing.\nHowever, price ceilings can have unintended consequences. A price ceiling below the equilibrium price will result in a shortage of the good. This happens because the price ceiling is set below the level that balances the willingness of buyers to purchase the good with the willingness of sellers to supply the good.\nSOLUTION: An effective price ceiling must be at a price below the equilibrium price. This is because a price ceiling above the equilibrium price will not result in a shortage. Instead, the market will trade at the price ceiling.\nA price ceiling below the equilibrium price will cause a shortage of the good. The quantity of the good supplied is less than the quantity that would be supplied at the equilibrium price.\nA price ceiling will increase the quantity of the good supplied. This is because the price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, which means that sellers will supply more of the good to buyers.\nA price ceiling will cause a shift in the demand curve for the good. This is because a price ceiling below the equilibrium price indicates to buyers that the good is in high demand. This can cause some buyers to enter the market, which leads to an increase in the quantity of the good demanded.\nA price ceiling will have no effect on the quantity of the good supplied if the quantity of the good supplied is already at the equilibrium level.
