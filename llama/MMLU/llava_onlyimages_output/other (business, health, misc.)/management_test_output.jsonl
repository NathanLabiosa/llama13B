They may be spread out across different buildings, cities, countries, or even continents.\nSo, for a virtual team, location can be different than it is for a traditional, or face-to-face, team.\nSOLUTION: When considering the location of a virtual team, there are several factors to keep in mind.\nFirst, it is important to note that virtual teams can be spread out across a distance. So, the location of each team member is different than it would be for a traditional team.\nSecond, it is important to consider the type of work the team does. Some tasks are better suited to a face-to-face team, while others can be done remotely. For example, a software development team may be able to work remotely, while a customer service team may need to be in the same location to provide the best support.\nFinally, it is important to consider the technology that the team will use to communicate and collaborate. This technology can affect the location of the team. For example, a team that uses video conferencing to communicate may need to be in the same country to avoid high phone bills."}

This can include deciding who will do what tasks, and how resources will be distributed.\nTo organise lines of communication: An organisational structure can help to define who reports to whom, which can help to organise lines of communication.\nTo formalise authority: An organisational structure can help to define who has authority over different parts of the organisation. This can include deciding which parts of the organisation report to which managers.\nTo limit workers' rights: An organisational structure can help to define the rights that workers have within the organisation.

{"question": "To what time-frame do strategic plans relate?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Long-term"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Medium-term"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Short-term"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Unspecified time it takes to achieve an aim"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A strategic plan is a document that outlines an organization's goals and the actions it will take to achieve them. The time-frame for a strategic plan is important because it shows the scope of the plan.\nA long-term strategic plan typically covers a period of three to five years or more. Long-term plans are usually concerned with issues such as overall corporate direction, major projects, and investments in capital equipment.\nA medium-term strategic plan typically covers a period of one to three years. Medium-term plans may be updated more frequently than long-term plans. They are often concerned with issues such as market position, new products, and marketing strategy.\nA short-term strategic plan typically covers a period of less than one year. Short-term plans may be updated more frequently than medium-term plans. They are often concerned with issues such as annual budgets, sales targets, and production schedules.\nAn unspecified time it takes to achieve an aim is a poor choice for a strategic plan. It is important to have a specific time frame for a plan. If you do not know how long it will take to achieve a goal, it is difficult to plan how to achieve it.\nSOLUTION: A short-term strategic plan relates to the time it takes to achieve an aim. Short-term plans usually cover a period of less than one year. So, a short-term strategic plan relates to a time frame of less than one year."}

Some theories focus on the tasks and activities that make up a job. Other theories focus on the social and technical systems in which work is done.\nThree key characteristics of a job are:\n1. Interests: The tasks and activities that the job involves.\n2. Skills: The knowledge and abilities that are needed to do the job.\n3. Duties: The responsibilities of the job.\nThe Job Characteristics Model focuses on how these three characteristics of a job affect job satisfaction and job performance.\nAccording to the Job Characteristics Model, jobs that are interesting, have a good fit with employees' skills, and provide opportunities for growth and development are more likely to be satisfying and to improve performance. Jobs that are uninteresting, have a poor fit with employees' skills, and do not provide opportunities for growth and development are less likely to be satisfying and to improve performance.\nThe Socio-technical systems approach views organizations as systems of social and technical systems. This approach focuses on the ways in which social and technical systems interact to affect work.\nThe techno-structural change model views change in an organization's technology as leading to changes in an organization's structure. This model suggests that changes in an organization's technology can change the ways in which work is designed.\nThe process improvement approach focuses on identifying and eliminating inefficiencies in business processes. This approach does not necessarily consider the impact of process changes on job design."}

To do this, organizations must determine their objectives, identify the tasks necessary to achieve those objectives, and then assign tasks to the people within the organization who are best able to perform them.\nOrganizations are designed as systems to achieve their goals. A key component of any system is feedback, which allows organizations to learn from experience and make adjustments as needed.\nThe characteristic that is most commonly associated with the rational goal model of management is productivity. According to the rational goal model, organizations exist to achieve their objectives. So, the most important measure of an organization's effectiveness is its productivity: the degree to which it achieves its objectives.\nWorker welfare, interpersonal relationships, and health and safety are important goals for many organizations. However, according to the rational goal model, these are not the most important goals. The rational goal model holds that organizations exist to achieve their objectives, and that productivity is the most important measure of organizational effectiveness."}

For example, employees might be able to choose which tasks to work on or when to take breaks.\nAnother example of worker autonomy is greater worker negotiation. This means that employees have more input into decisions that affect their work. For example, employees might be able to negotiate with managers about their workload or their schedule.\nWorker empowerment is an example of worker autonomy. This means that employees are given the tools and resources they need to make decisions about their work.

{"question": "Vertical integration forwards is when a firm mergers or acquires another", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Towards the source of supply"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Towards the consumer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "At the same stage of the supply chain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In another industry"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Vertical integration is a strategy that firms can use to gain greater control over their supply chain. There are several types of vertical integration.\nForward integration occurs when a firm merges or acquires a firm that is farther along in the supply chain. This type of vertical integration helps the firm secure supplies of inputs. For example, a food processing company may acquire a farm to ensure a steady supply of fresh produce.\nReverse integration occurs when a firm merges or acquires a firm that is closer to the consumer. This type of vertical integration helps the firm gain greater control over its brand and capture more value from its products. For example, a car company may open its own dealerships to capture more profit from the sale of its cars.\nIntegration at the same stage of the supply chain occurs when a firm merges or acquires a firm that is at the same stage of the supply chain. This type of vertical integration helps the firm reduce costs and improve efficiency. For example, two chemical companies may merge to achieve cost savings by eliminating redundancies in their manufacturing processes.\n horizontal integration occurs when a firm merges or acquires a firm in the same industry but at the same stage of the supply chain. This type of vertical integration helps the firm reduce costs and improve efficiency. For example, two car companies may merge to achieve cost savings by eliminating redundancies in their administrative offices.\nVertical integration forwards is when a firm merges or acquires another firm that is farther along in the supply chain.
