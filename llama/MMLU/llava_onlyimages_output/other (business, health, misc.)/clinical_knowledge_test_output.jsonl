{"question": "The activity of creatine kinase is:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "increased when intracellular ADP rises."}, {"label": "B", "text": "increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9."}, {"label": "C", "text": "always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres."}, {"label": "D", "text": "increased after a period of endurance training."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Creatine kinase is an enzyme that helps supply energy to muscles.\nCreatine kinase is increased when intracellular ADP rises. This means that when the levels of ADP inside the cell increase, the activity of creatine kinase also increases. This is because ADP is a substance that indicates how much ATP is available. When ADP rises, it indicates that ATP is being used at a higher-than-normal rate. So, the activity of creatine kinase increases.\nCreatine kinase is increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9. This means that when the acidity of muscle decreases, the activity of creatine kinase also increases. This is because muscle acidity is a measure of the level of fatigue in the muscle. When muscle pH falls, it means that the muscle is more fatigued. So, the activity of creatine kinase increases.\nCreatine kinase is always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres. This means that creatine kinase is an enzyme that is found in lower quantities in Type II fibres than Type I fibres.\nCreatine kinase is increased after a period of endurance training. This means that after a period of training that involves long, slow periods of activity, the activity of creatine kinase increases."}

Stroke volume is determined by three factors: preload, contractility, and afterload.\nPreload is the pressure of blood in the ventricles before contraction. The higher the preload, the more strongly the ventricles contract.\nContractility is the ability of the heart muscle to stretch and contract. The more strongly the heart muscle contracts, the more blood is pumped out of the heart with each beat.\nAfterload is the pressure of blood against the heart muscle as it contracts. The higher the afterload, the more strongly the heart muscle must contract to pump blood out of the heart.\nSOLUTION: Blood volume is not a factor in stroke volume. The amount of blood in the ventricles does not affect the volume of blood pumped in a stroke.\nCardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Cardiac output is a measure of the heart's efficiency.\nContractility, preload, and afterload are the factors that regulate stroke volume."}

{"question": "The creatine kinase reaction is:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "irreversible."}, {"label": "B", "text": "slow compared with glycolysis."}, {"label": "C", "text": "not activated until all the ATP has been used up."}, {"label": "D", "text": "inhibited by low pH in the muscle."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Creatine kinase is involved in the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to proteins. This makes creatine kinase an essential player in many cellular processes, such as muscle contraction and protein synthesis.\nCreatine kinase is not permanently bound to its substrates. Instead, it can move freely within the cell. When creatine kinase is not associated with a substrate, it is in an inactive form. But when it binds to a substrate, it becomes active.\nCreatine kinase is activated when it binds to ATP. Once activated, creatine kinase can transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a protein. But this reaction is irreversible. So, after a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to a protein, the creatine kinase molecule is used up.\nCreatine kinase is inhibited by low pH. This means that the lower the pH, the less active creatine kinase is. This is because the pH affects the speed of the reaction.\nCreatine kinase is not activated until all the ATP has been used up. This means that creatine kinase cannot help with the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi. But it can help with the formation of other cellular components from these substances."}

A stoma site on the outside of the body is called a stoma. A stoma site on the inside of the body is called a pouching system.\nA stoma is usually site in the lower abdomen, but it can be site in other locations, such as the upper abdomen or hips.\nWhen a stoma is site in the rectus sheath abdominis, it is site in the outermost layer of the abdominal muscles. This type of stoma may move around more than a stoma site in the deeper layers of the abdomen.\nA stoma site next to the umbilicus, or belly button, may make it easier to conceal the stoma with clothing.\nWithin an abdominal crease is a good location for a stoma. It may be less noticeable, and the stoma output may be less likely to come into contact with clothing.\nIn close proximity to the incision site may not be the best location for a stoma. The stoma may drain into the incision, which could be socially embarrassing.\nSOLUTION: A stoma should not be site in close proximity to the incision site.

DNA is made up of two long strands of molecules called nucleotides.\nNucleotides are made of three parts: a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base can be one of four types: adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine.\nDNA has four nitrogenous bases. The sequence of these nitrogenous bases is called a gene. Each gene encodes, or contains the information for, a specific protein.\nProteins are made by reading the sequence of nitrogenous bases in a gene. This process is called transcription. The sequence of nitrogenous bases in an RNA molecule is called a ribosome.\nRNA plays a role in the process called translation. Translation is the process of making proteins. During translation, a ribosome reads the sequence of nitrogenous bases in an RNA molecule. This process tells the ribosome which protein to produce. The ribosome then uses the information to assemble a chain of amino acids, called a polypeptide. The polypeptide is the protein specified by the RNA molecule."}

ATP (Adenosine TriPhosphate) is the molecule that provides the energy for a muscle to contract.\nWhen a muscle contracts, it uses ATP. After the muscle uses ATP, it must get more ATP to continue contracting. This can be done through aerobic or anaerobic respiration.\nAerobic respiration uses oxygen to create more ATP. Anaerobic respiration uses another molecule, called pyruvate, to create ATP.\nBoth anaerobic and aerobic respiration can create ATP, but anaerobic respiration creates only a few ATP molecules per molecule of pyruvate. Aerobic respiration creates many more ATP molecules per molecule of oxygen.\nSo, for a muscle to continue contracting, it needs to get more ATP. Getting more ATP can happen through aerobic or anaerobic respiration. The decision to use aerobic or anaerobic respiration is based on the duration of the exercise.\nIf a muscle needs to create a lot of ATP very quickly, anaerobic respiration is used. This happens during short, maximal effort exercises.\nIf a muscle needs to create ATP over a longer period of time, aerobic respiration is used. This happens during long, low-intensity exercises.\nSOLUTION: During a maximal dynamic exercise, which is a short, high-intensity exercise, the muscle needs to create a lot of ATP very quickly. So, the muscle uses anaerobic respiration.\nThe exercise becomes predominantly aerobic when the muscle needs to create ATP over a longer period of time. At that point, the muscle uses aerobic respiration to create ATP.\nA 10-second exercise is not long enough for the muscle to run out of ATP and switch to using aerobic respiration. So, the muscle uses anaerobic respiration throughout the exercise.\nA 30-second exercise is somewhat longer. It is long enough for the muscle to run out of ATP and switch to using aerobic respiration. So, the muscle uses aerobic respiration during the last 30 seconds of the exercise.\nA 1-minute exercise is even longer. It is long enough for the muscle to run out of ATP and switch to using aerobic respiration. So, the muscle uses aerobic respiration during the last 60 seconds of the exercise.\nA 4-minute exercise is much longer. It is long enough for the muscle to run out of ATP and switch to using aerobic respiration. So, the muscle uses aerobic respiration during the last 3 minutes and 50 seconds of the exercise."}

These changes may include changes in proteins, which can affect how an organism looks or acts.\nSome mutations can be harmful, but others have no effect or may even be helpful. Harmful mutations can include both point mutations and chromosomal mutations.\nA point mutation involves a change in a single nucleotide. These types of mutations can include both missense and nonsense mutations.\nA missense mutation occurs when a single nucleotide is changed to a different nucleotide. These changes can change a protein's amino acid sequence, which can change the protein's function.\nA nonsense mutation occurs when a single nucleotide is changed to a stop codon. This type of mutation can change a protein's amino acid sequence, but the altered protein is then terminated and disposed of.\nA chromosomal mutation involves a change in a chromosome. These types of mutations can include both structural and numerical changes.\nA structural chromosomal mutation involves a change in the arrangement of genes on a chromosome. These changes can include inversions, deletions, and translocations.\nA numerical chromosomal mutation involves a change in the number of chromosomes. Polyploidy is a type of numerical chromosomal mutation.\nThe rate of spontaneous mutations is low, but they can accumulate over time. Over long periods of time, the accumulation of harmful mutations may increase the risk of cancer.\nCarcinogens are substances that increase the risk of cancer. Some carcinogens work by damaging DNA.

The yellow color is caused by a buildup of bilirubin, a substance that is produced when the body breaks down old red blood cells.\nBilirubin is used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells. This is not true. The liver produces bilirubin, but it is not used in the synthesis of red blood cells.\nItching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice is a type of jaundice in which the flow of bile is blocked. This can cause itching.\nPale stools and dark urine are characteristic of the jaundice of haemolytic anaemia. Haemolytic anaemia is a type of anaemia in which the body destroys red blood cells. One sign of this type of anaemia is pale stools and dark urine.\nPutting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is optional. Jaundice itself is not a sign of infection. But if a person has jaundice and is also an intravenous drug user, there is an increased risk of infection. So, a danger of infection sticker should be put on the person's blood samples."}

It sets the limit for how quickly the pathway can proceed.\nThere are many ways in which an organism's metabolic pathways can be affected by its genes. One way is by controlling the amount of enzymes that are produced. The amount of an enzyme produced is called its level of expression.\nThe level of expression of an enzyme is determined by its gene. The rate of production of an enzyme is called its rate of expression.\nSome enzymes are produced at a high level of expression, and others are produced at a low level of expression. Enzymes that are produced at a low level of expression are often called rate-limiting enzymes.\nSOLUTION: Phosphofructokinase is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. It sets the limit for how quickly glycolysis can proceed.\nThis means that if phosphofructokinase is present in low amounts, glycolysis will proceed slowly. But if phosphofructokinase is present in high amounts, glycolysis will proceed quickly.\nHexokinase is not the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis.\nWays in which hexokinase could be affected by gene expression include changes in its level of expression and changes in its activity.\nHowever, hexokinase is not the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis.

These nerves carry information between the central nervous system and the rest of the body.\nThe symptoms of peripheral neuropathy include sensory loss, muscle weakness, and changes in the sensation of warmth or cold.\nThe distribution of the symptoms depends on which nerves are damaged. Damage to nerves that supply the hands and feet (peripheral nerves) can result in a stocking distribution of sensory loss. This means that the loss of sensation starts at the toes and moves up the legs.\nThe tone of the muscles is kept by the nervous system. In peripheral neuropathy, the tone is increased bilaterally in the legs. This means that the muscles in both legs are more tense than normal.\nReflexes are quick responses to stimulation. In peripheral neuropathy, reflexes are very brisk with reinforcement. This means that the reflexes are stronger than normal when the doctor taps on a nerve.\nThe distribution of weakness in peripheral neuropathy is different from the distribution of the symptoms of polyneuropathy. Weakness is more marked proximally than distally. This means that the muscles in the upper parts of the legs are weaker than the muscles in the lower parts."}

When you exercise, the demand for ATP increases. So, the breakdown of glucose for glycolysis increases. This provides more ATP for the demand of the exercising muscles.\nDuring glycolysis, two molecules of glucose are used to make two molecules of pyruvate. The pyruvate can be used in the mitochondria to make ATP through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation.\nThe tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are part of the process of cellular respiration, which uses oxygen to break down food (glucose) to make ATP.\nPhosphocreatine breakdown is not the most rapid way to resynthesize ATP during exercise. Although breakdown of phosphocreatine can provide some immediate ATP, it is not a major source of ATP during exercise.\nTricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) is not the most rapid way to resynthesize ATP during exercise. The tricarboxylic acid cycle provides precursor molecules for the synthesis of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. It does not directly provide ATP.\nGlycogenolysis is not the most rapid way to resynthesize ATP during exercise. Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen to glucose.

{"question": "Measuring the blood pressure in an arm that is above the level of the heart will:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "accurately estimate the blood pressure."}, {"label": "B", "text": "overestimate the blood pressure."}, {"label": "C", "text": "cause an auscultatory gap."}, {"label": "D", "text": "underestimate the blood pressure."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Blood pressure is a measure of the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. This force is what drives blood out of your heart and through the rest of your body.\nBlood pressure can be measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). One of the methods for measuring blood pressure is the auscultatory method. In this method, a healthcare provider uses a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope to listen to your arteries.\nThe correct position for taking a blood pressure reading is sitting on a chair with your feet on the floor. Your arm should be supported over the back of the chair. The blood pressure cuff should be placed on your upper arm. The level of your arm should be at the same height as your heart.\nSOLUTION: Blood pressure is a measure of the pressure in your arteries. The pressure in your arteries depends on the height of the arm being measured and the level of the heart.\nWhen the arm is above the level of the heart, the pressure in the arteries is higher than it would be if the arm were at the same height as the heart. This means that the blood pressure measurement will be higher than it would be if the arm were at the same height as the heart.\nSo, measuring the blood pressure in an arm that is above the level of the heart will overestimate the blood pressure."}
