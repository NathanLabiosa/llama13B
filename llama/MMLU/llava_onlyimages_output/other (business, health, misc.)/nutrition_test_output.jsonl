The incidence rate of a disease is a measure of the change in the incidence of the disease over time.\nAn increase in the incidence rate of a disease indicates that the prevalence of the disease in the population is increasing. So, in order to determine why the prevalence of a disease in the population might be increasing, you need to find the choice that describes a situation in which the incidence rate of the disease is increasing.\nSOLUTION: The incidence rate of a disease is affected by the balance between new cases of the disease and recoveries from the disease. A decrease in the incidence rate of the disease indicates that there are fewer new cases of the disease than there were in the previous time period. This means that the number of recoveries is greater than the number of new cases. So, in order to increase the prevalence of the disease, the incidence rate of the disease must fall."}

IGF-1 has been shown to mediate the effect of obesity on cancer risk.\nObesity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and high levels of IGF-1 are produced by the body in response to diabetes. High levels of IGF-1 have been shown to increase the risk of several types of cancer, including cancer of the endometrium.\nTestosterone and estrogen are hormones that can affect the growth of the endometrium. The relationship between these hormones and the risk of endometrial cancer is not as simple as the passage describes.\nTestosterone is an androgen, or male hormone. In women, androgens are produced in small amounts by the ovaries. High levels of androgens have been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\nEstrogen is a hormone that can affect the growth of the endometrium. Because obesity increases the level of estrogen in the body, some scientists have questioned whether the increased risk of endometrial cancer in obese women is due to the high levels of estrogen.\nThyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Thyroxine does not mediate the effect of obesity on the risk of endometrial cancer."}

This statement is incorrect.\nFatty acids are absorbed in the intestine through the enterocytes of the distal duodenum and the jejunum. Fatty acids are absorbed through both FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins. FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins are found in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum and the jejunum.\nThe statement that after absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system is incorrect. This statement is incorrect.\nAfter a meal, triglycerides are broken down into free fatty acids and then into fatty acids and glycerol. Triglycerides are not absorbed as triglycerides. MCT and LCT are different types of fatty acids. They are not different types of triglycerides. MCT and LCT are transported by different transport proteins.\nThe products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption is incorrect. This statement is incorrect.\nMixed micelles are formed when dietary cholesterol and phospholipids combine with bile salts to form mixed micelles. Triglycerides can also combine with bile salts to form mixed micelles. But the formation of mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids does not increase absorption.\nTriglycerides must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported is incorrect. This statement is incorrect.\nFatty acids are absorbed through the enterocytes of the small intestine. They do not need to be emulsified and digested before they can be absorbed."}

Some doctors use the average bone density of young adults as a standard. Other doctors use the bone density of people in their 30s or 40s as a standard.\nIn North America and Western Europe, osteopenia is diagnosed when a woman's bone mineral density is between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations below the average for young adults.\nDoctors use different standards for men and women. For women over age 80, doctors often use a bone density that is between 1 and 2 standard deviations below the average bone density of women the same age.\nSo, women over age 80 with osteopenia have above average bone mineral density for their age."}

Isotopes have different amounts of mass. The mass of a substance is a measure of the weight of the substance.\nIsotopes of a element have the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei. But, they can have different numbers of neutrons.\nBecause they have different masses, isotopes of a element have different atomic weights.\nThe atomic weight of an isotope is a measure of the weight of one atom of the isotope.\nScientists use the terms \"mass difference\" and \"atomic weight difference\" to describe the difference between the atomic weights of two isotopes of an element.\nSOLUTION: The mass difference and the atomic weight difference are equal for all isotopes of an element. So, the mass difference and the atomic weight difference are used to describe the isotopes of an element.\nThe mass difference and the atomic weight difference are written in units of mass.\nTo determine which isotope is commonly given for the measurement of total body water, you need to know which isotope has a mass difference and an atomic weight difference that are both in the same range as the mass difference and atomic weight difference for total body water.\nYou can see that the mass difference for oxygen 18 is 18. The atomic weight difference for oxygen 18 is 18. These values are in the same range as the mass difference and atomic weight difference for total body water.\nThe mass difference for nitrogen 15 is 15. The atomic weight difference for nitrogen 15 is 15. These values are not in the same range as the mass difference and atomic weight difference for total body water.\nThe mass difference for carbon 13 is 13.

Disorders that affect the small intestine can impair the absorption of nutrients and cause gastrointestinal symptoms.\nOne way that the small intestine digests food is by producing digestive enzymes. These enzymes help break down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed through the intestinal walls.\nLactase is an enzyme produced by cells in the small intestine. It breaks down milk into two simpler molecules: glucose and galactose. If you do not produce enough lactase, milk cannot be completely broken down for absorption. This is called lactase deficiency.\nSucrase is an enzyme produced by cells in the small intestine. It breaks down table sugar (sucrose) into two simpler sugars: glucose and fructose.\nSOLUTION: Milk contains lactose, a sugar that is broken down by lactase. If you do not produce enough lactase, milk cannot be completely broken down for absorption. This can cause digestive symptoms such as abdominal cramps and diarrhea.\nSo, the most likely cause of the student's problem is a lack of small intestinal lactase."}

This can happen when the body has too much leptin but fails to respond to it.\nLeptin is produced by the body's cells, and its levels can increase in response to obesity. When leptin levels are high, they should signal the body to stop eating and to increase energy expenditure. However, in leptin-resistant individuals, this response does not happen. Instead, the body may continue to eat and store fat.\nThere are several possible causes of leptin resistance. One is a deficiency of leptin caused by a mutation in the leptin gene. This is a rare cause of leptin resistance.\nAnother possible cause is lack of leptin release from the adipose tissue. This can occur in obesity-related conditions such as lipodystrophy.\nThe other two causes are high concentrations of leptin without reduction in energy intake and low concentrations of leptin with increased energy intake. Both of these can occur in obesity.\nWhen the body has high concentrations of leptin without a decrease in energy intake, the body may become resistant to the effects of leptin. This is one way that leptin resistance can occur in obesity.\nOn the other hand, when the body has low concentrations of leptin but is still eating too much, the body may become resistant to the effects of leptin. This is another way that leptin resistance can occur in obesity."}

This can affect how easily a gene can be turned on and produce a protein.\nSome environmental factors, such as malnutrition, have been shown to affect methylation patterns in animals.\nA study of rats found that in utero exposure to famine (a lack of nutritious food) affected methylation patterns in the rats' offspring. The effects depended on when the rats were exposed to famine during their pregnancy.\nIn the study, rats were fed either a normal diet or a diet that was short on nutrients. The researchers then measured methylation patterns in the offspring's blood cells.\nThey found that rats that were fed a short-nutrient diet during the third trimester of pregnancy had offspring with methylation patterns that were different from rats that were fed a normal diet. The third trimester is the period from the start of week 33 until the end of week 36 of pregnancy.\nNo differences in methylation patterns were seen for rats that were fed a short-nutrient diet during the first or second trimesters.\nSOLUTION: The study of rats suggests that in utero exposure to a shortage of nutrients during the third trimester of pregnancy may affect methylation patterns in offspring."}

Instead, the efficiency of protein digestion in the stomach is determined by the concentration of hydrochloric acid and pepsin in the stomach.\nGastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion.\nThis statement is incorrect.\nThe process of protein digestion in the stomach is initiated by the hydrochloric acid and pepsin that are produced by the stomach. Gastric zymogenic cells do not produce these enzymes.\nThe products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters, the correct answer is LECTURE: The human body uses proteins to build and repair tissues. To do this, the body needs amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.\nThe body can get amino acids from dietary protein. Digestion is the process by which the body breaks down dietary protein into amino acids that can be used to build and repair tissues.\nProtein digestion begins in the mouth and continues in the stomach and small intestine. In the stomach, protein digestion is initiated by stomach acid, which breaks down the protein into smaller peptides. Peptides are broken down into amino acids by pepsin, an enzyme that is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach.\nThe amino acids are then absorbed into the bloodstream. The blood carries the amino acids to the liver, where they are processed before being sent to the rest of the body.\nThe liver can also produce amino acids. It can do this by converting other amino acids into the specific amino acids that are needed by the body.\nSOLUTION: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides.\nFree amino acids are amino acids that are not attached to other amino acids. They are absorbed directly into the bloodstream.\nDi- or tripeptides are short chains of amino acids that are attached to each other. They are absorbed into the bloodstream as di- or tripeptides.\nGastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum.\nThis statement is incorrect.\nThe efficiency of protein digestion in the stomach is not affected by the grinding action of the antrum. Instead, the efficiency of protein digestion in the stomach is determined by the concentration of hydrochloric acid and pepsin in the stomach.\nGastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion.\nThis statement is incorrect.\nThe process of protein digestion in the stomach is initiated by the hydrochloric acid and pepsin that are produced by the stomach. Gastric zymogenic cells do not produce these enzymes.\nThe products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters, the correct answer is.\nThe absorption of amino acids by the body is facilitated by the presence of transporters in the small intestine. There are 14 different transporters, and only one of them is used to absorb the amino acids that are produced from dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes."}

The walls of the GI tract are lined with folds of tissue called villi. These villi increase the surface area of the GI tract and help with absorption.\nThe absorption of nutrients and water from the GI tract happens for the most part through the following processes:\nSOLUTION: The statement about absorption from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract is most correct.\nThe brush border membrane is the part of the membrane that is closest to the lumen, or inner space, of the villi. It is thick with tiny projections called microvilli. These projections increase the surface area of the membrane. This gives the brush border membrane a larger surface area than the rest of the membrane. So, more absorption occurs along the brush border membrane than along the rest of the membrane.\nFructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose. So, fructose is not absorbed by the same transporter as galactose and glucose.\nGalactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane.\nMost water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the colon. So, D. is incorrect.\nThe absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake. So, A. is incorrect."}

This is called trained performance.\nNutritional strategies can affect how well your body performs a certain type of exercise. Some nutritional strategies can help improve trained performance. Other strategies, however, may not improve performance.\nTapering is a type of nutritional strategy. It involves decreasing the intensity and volume of training in the days leading up to a race or event. The idea is to rest and recover before the event. Tapering may help improve trained performance.\nCarbohydrate loading is a type of nutritional strategy. It involves eating a large amount of carbohydrates for a few days before a race or event. The idea is to improve the body's ability to use carbohydrates for fuel during the race or event. Carbohydrate loading may help improve trained performance.\nThe classic glycogen loading regime is a type of nutritional strategy. It involves eating a large amount of carbohydrates for a few days before a race or event to increase the body's glycogen stores. The idea is to improve the body's ability to use glycogen for fuel during the race or event. The classic glycogen loading regime may help improve trained performance.\nExogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise is a type of nutritional strategy. It involves drinking a sports drink or eating gels during exercise to provide more carbohydrates. The idea is to improve performance during exercise. Exogenous carbohydrate ingestion may help improve untrained performance, but it may not improve trained performance.\nSOLUTION: Prolonged endurance type exercise is untrained performance. So, nutritional strategies that improve untrained performance may not improve performance during prolonged endurance type exercise.\nExogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise does not improve glycogen stores. So, it may not improve trained performance during prolonged endurance type exercise.\nTapering, the classic glycogen loading regime, and carbohydrate loading are nutritional strategies that can improve trained performance.

The two three-carbon products can then be used to produce other molecules, such as ATP.\nGlucagon increases the rate of glycolysis. Glucagon is a hormone that is released by the pancreas. It signals to the liver that it is time to break down glycogen into glucose. Glucagon also increases the rate of glycolysis, which breaks down glucose into two three-carbon products.\nNADP+ is not required for glycolysis. Glycolysis does not require NADP+. Instead, it requires NAD+. NAD+ and NADP+ are coenzymes. Coenzymes are molecules that help enzymes to do their jobs.\nThe end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate.

It tells you that normally, triacylglycerols are found at concentrations of 75-95% in fats.\nNon-renewable energy sources are typically fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are formed from the remains of organisms that lived in the distant past. These organisms had a high concentration of carbon. Over many years, the organisms' remains were converted into fossil fuels.\nFossil fuels contain a high percentage of carbon. So, fossil fuels have a high percentage of carbon compared to other elements.\nThe percent of carbon in a fossil fuel is a measure of the fossil fuel's volatility. Volatility is a measure of how easily the fossil fuel's molecules break down into smaller, more usable molecules.\nFossil fuels with a higher percentage of carbon are more volatile than fossil fuels with a lower percentage of carbon. So, fossil fuels with a higher percentage of carbon can be used as fuel more easily than fossil fuels with a lower percentage of carbon.\nSOLUTION: Non-renewable energy sources are fossil fuels. As described above, fossil fuels have a high percentage of carbon. So, non-renewable energy sources typically contain 75-95% carbon."}

{"question": "The 'mad cows disease' has had the greatest impact on food choice due to which of the following?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A difference in perception of risk"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Higher prices of meat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Farmers or food producers not trusting the government"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Scientists investigating alternatives for meat"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When people are deciding what to eat, their food choices are affected by a variety of factors. Some of these factors are based on the nutritional content of different foods. For example, people may choose to eat more protein, or they may choose to eat fewer carbohydrates.\nOther factors are based on the perceived risk of eating different foods. People may avoid foods that they believe are more likely to cause foodborne illness. In the past, people have avoided fish because they were concerned about the risk of contamination with mercury. More recently, there has been a rise in the number of people who are choosing to eat vegetables and fruits that are grown organically. This may be because they are concerned about the long-term risk of exposure to pesticides.\nThe perceived risk of foodborne illness is influenced by a variety of factors. One of these is the degree of processing that a food has undergone. People may perceive risks to be higher for foods that have been less processed. For example, meat may be seen as higher risk than vegetables.\nAnother factor that affects the perceived risk of foodborne illness is the presence of harmful substances in food. In the past, people have avoided fish because they were concerned about the risk of contamination with mercury. More recently, there has been a rise in the number of people who are choosing to eat vegetables and fruits that are grown organically. This may be because they are concerned about the long-term risk of exposure to pesticides.\nSOLUTION: The perceived risk of foodborne illness is higher for meat than for vegetables. People are more likely to die from a foodborne illness caused by meat than from a foodborne illness caused by vegetables.\nBecause the perceived risk of foodborne illness is higher for meat than for vegetables, differences in perceptions of risk have a bigger impact on food choice for meat than for vegetables."}

It is found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Fibre is considered to be a nutrient because it cannot be digested. However, fibre can keep you feeling full and can help prevent constipation.\nFibre is composed of many different materials. The main types are soluble and insoluble. Soluble fibre can dissolve in water to form a gel-like substance. Insoluble fibre does not dissolve in water.\nBoth soluble and insoluble fibre are fermented in the colon. This means that the bacteria in the colon digest the fibre and break it down. The end products of fermentation are gases, such as methane and hydrogen, and short-chain fatty acids, such as acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. These end products are important for maintaining colon health.\nThe fermentation of fibre in the colon is one reason why fibre is important for preventing constipation. Stool bulking occurs mainly through the action of insoluble fibres such as cellulose. When insoluble fibre is fermented in the colon, it creates a softer, more bulky stool.\nSOLUTION: C. Fermentation studies in vitro, with human faeces, have shown that soluble and insoluble forms are fermented completely within 24 hours."}

{"question": "Bone mineral accretion\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Is rapid in the first 10 weeks of foetal life"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Is slow in infancy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In childhood, adolescence and young adulthood predicts risk of fracture in old age"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Is particularly high after the menopause in women"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Bone mineral accretion is the process by which bone density increases. This process is crucial for the growth and development of bones.\nBone mineral accretion is rapid in the first 10 weeks of foetal life. This is a period of rapid growth, and the developing foetus needs to lay down bone material at a high rate.\nDuring infancy, bone mineral accretion is slow. Infants are growing, but not at a rapid pace.\nIn childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, bone mineral accretion is a strong predictor of bone density in old age. This means that the higher the rate of bone mineral accretion during these years, the higher the bone density will be in old age.\nAfter the menopause, bone mineral accretion is particularly high. This is because the drop in oestrogen levels that occurs after the menopause stimulates bone formation."}

Faecal digestibility measures the percentage of protein that is recovered in the feces. This can tell you how well a protein is broken down in the digestive tract.\nFaecal digestibility can be measured at the terminal ileum, which is the end of the small intestine. But it can also be measured farther up the digestive tract, such as in the stomach and duodenum.\nMeasuring digestibility at the terminal ileum gives the most accurate measure of how well a protein is digested. This is because the majority of protein digestion occurs in the small intestine, and the terminal ileum is the last part of the small intestine.\nSo, digestibility can only be measured at the terminal ileum."}

Increased glucose production by the liver is one way the body can maintain normal blood glucose levels when insulin resistance is present. However, in type 2 diabetes, the liver is not able to produce enough glucose to meet the body's needs, and blood glucose levels rise. Impaired insulin secretion and decreased glucose uptake from the skeletal muscle also contribute to hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes."}

This process requires the participation of multiple enzymes, or proteins. As part of this process, some enzymes need to be reduced, or get rid of an electron. Riboflavin acts as a coenzyme for these reduction reactions, helping to provide the electron that is needed.\nNiacin is a vitamin that is also known as vitamin B3. Like other B vitamins, niacin plays important roles in many cellular processes. But niacin does not provide the coenzyme for reduction reactions in fatty acid synthesis.\nFolate is a vitamin that is also known as vitamin B9. Folate plays important roles in many cellular processes, including the synthesis of DNA and RNA. But folate does not provide the coenzyme for reduction reactions in fatty acid synthesis.\nVitamin B6 is a vitamin that provides the coenzyme for amino acid synthesis. It does this by donating its own molecule to the enzyme that is involved in this process. This donation of the coenzyme is important for the enzyme to work properly. But vitamin B6 does not provide the coenzyme for reduction reactions in fatty acid synthesis."}

This type of evidence supports the conclusion that the exposure is a cause of the outcome.\nEpidemiologists can use this type of evidence to establish possible causes of a health outcome. For example, consider an epidemiologist studying a cluster of cancers in a certain location. She examines the evidence and finds that the cancers were more common among people who had lived in the area for a long time, and that the cancer risk decreased after people moved away. From this evidence, the epidemiologist concludes that the cancers were caused by exposure to something in the environment, and that reducing exposure to this thing would reverse the risk of getting cancer."}
{"question": "Women who are planning a pregnancy are recommended to take a supplement of 400\u00ecg folic acid/ day before and until the end of the first trimester of pregnancy.

Methylation of the IGF2 gene is associated with insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) imprinting. Imprinting refers to a situation in which a gene is turned on or turned off depending on whether it came from the father or the mother.\nA study of children born to women who took folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy found that these children had less methylation of the IGF2 gene. This means that the IGF2 gene was more active in these children. The study did not find a difference in the effect based on the child's gender."}

This type of study can examine the effects of eating vegetarian diets on health.\nHowever, studies of this type can be confounded. A confounding variable is a variable that affects the outcome of the study and is not measured or controlled for.\nSOLUTION: A confounding variable can make it difficult to determine whether a vegetarian diet affects health. For example, consider a study that compares the health of vegetarians to the health of meat-eaters. If vegetarians in the study are more likely to be from a higher social class than meat-eaters, the health difference between the two groups may be due to social class rather than diet. This means that the study is confounded by social class.\nTo interpret the health of vegetarians compared with meat-eaters, you need to determine which factors are confounding variables. Age, social class, and physical activity are all potential confounding variables. Smoking habit is not.\nAge is a confounding variable. Older people are more likely to have health problems than younger people. So, the health difference between vegetarians and meat-eaters may be due to age, rather than diet.\nSocial class/position is a confounding variable. People from higher social classes tend to have better health than people from lower social classes. So, the health difference between vegetarians and meat-eaters may be due to social class, rather than diet.\nPhysical activity is not a confounding variable. Physical activity affects health, but it is not related to whether a person is a vegetarian or a meat-eater.\nSmoking habit is a confounding variable. Smoking is bad for health. So, the health difference between vegetarians and meat-eaters may be due to smoking habit, rather than diet."}

Insulin stimulates the lipase activity within adipose tissue, which in turn decreases plasma NEFA concentrations.\nThe suppressed lipoprotein lipase activity following a meal is correct. Lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin, and its activity decreases when NEFA concentrations decrease.\nChylomicrons are transported to the liver, where they are metabolized. The VLDL synthesis pathway is suppressed during the postprandial period, in favour of the hydrolysis of chylomicrons.\nThe activation of hormone-sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase by insulin during a meal is correct. These enzymes are inactive when ligands are not bound to them.\nAll of the options are correct. A mixed meal leads to the suppression of lipoprotein lipase activity, the activation of hormone-sensitive lipase, and the hydrolysis of chylomicrons.

To manage potential risks to human health, economically important food substances are often tested for toxic effects. These tests can produce data on the toxicity of the substances. But toxicology tests can be expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to design. So, assessments of exposure are also needed to estimate the potential for humans to come into contact with the substances. Risk assessments are informed by toxicological tests and exposure assessments.\nTo support risk management decisions for food substances, information on the potential for a food substance to cause cancer or other health problems is important. This information can be used to calculate the potential risk.\nAllowable Daily Intakes (ADIs) are levels of exposure to a food substance that are considered safe. ADI values are used to help manage the potential risk from exposure to food substances.\nTo derive Allowable Daily Intakes, the potential risk to human health is compared to an acceptable level of risk. This acceptable level of risk is determined by risk assessments."}

So, access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.\nMost vitamin D in the body is formed in the skin after exposure to sunlight. In addition, foods containing large amounts of vitamin D are eaten by both poor and wealthy people according to various cultural reasons. So, the content of vitamin D in foods does not depend on wealth or age.\nThe content of vitamin D in foods does depend on the soil in which the food was grown. Vitamin D is created in the skin after exposure to sunlight, and the skin uses vitamin D from the diet. So, if the soil is deficient in vitamin D, foods grown in that soil will be deficient in vitamin D.\nDiets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D so that it becomes limiting. This means that the body's need for vitamin D may increase as the body grows."}

When demand for a commodity is high and the supply is inelastic, the price of the commodity will increase.\nThere are several ways in which the demand for a commodity can increase. One way is through speculation. When investors buy a commodity in the expectation that its price will increase, they can drive the price up.\nThis is what happened with commodity prices in 2007 and 2008. As the price of a commodity increased, investors were attracted to it. This increased demand drove the price up further.\nSOLUTION: It was caused by commodity price speculation.\nThe use of food crops to produce biofuel was among the causes of the food-price spike.\nThe production of biofuels uses mainly cereals and oilseeds. As a result, the use of food crops to produce biofuels can drive up the price of food.\nSome land that was previously used to grow food is now used to grow crops for biofuels. This can reduce the supply of food and drive up its price.\nLong-term neglect of agricultural and rural development was among the causes of the food-price spike.\nBy 2007, the world had experienced moderate price increases for food for the previous three years. Many people were already struggling to afford food.\nWhen the food-price spike of 2007-2008 began, it was on top of these existing high prices. This made the increase in food prices in 2007-2008 even more painful for people."}

Tagging with ubiquitin is a signal for the proteasome to break down the protein. The proteasome provides the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism. Lysosomal enzymes are involved in the breakdown of some proteins, but they do not provide the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism.\nThe rate of tissue protein catabolism is more or less constant throughout the day. The catabolism of all tissue proteins is not constant. Some proteins are catabolised at a faster rate than others. All proteins that are to be catabolised are tagged with the peptide ubiquitin. This statement is incorrect. The ubiquitin peptide signal is not required for all proteins to be catabolised. Lysosomal enzymes provide the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism.

For people with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can cause adverse reactions. For others, gluten may increase carbohydrate malabsorption.\nAvenin is a protein found in oats. Oats do not contain gluten. So, avenin is a constituent of avenin, not gluten.\nMaize is another word for corn. Corn does not contain gluten. So, a constituent of maize is the main protein in corn, not gluten.\nUC stands for ulcerative colitis. May be contra-indicated in UC means that consuming gluten may cause adverse reactions in people with UC. So, gluten may be contra-indicated in UC, not the other way around."}

Vitamin B12 deficiency can occur because of a lack of B12 in the diet, an inability to absorb B12 from the diet, or an underlying medical condition that affects B12 levels.\nAlthough many older people live in institutions and have low vitamin D status, this is not a generalization that is true for all older people living in Western countries.\nThere is strong evidence that vitamin C supplements do not lower the risk of cancer in older people.\nThere is some evidence that the risk of high iron stores is greater than the risk of iron deficiency in older people."}
{"question": "Which of the following could lead to iodine deficiency?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Low intake of fruits and vegetables"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Intake only of locally grown food in central Africa"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Insufficient caloric intake"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Inadequate sunlight exposure"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Iodine is a chemical element, a type of nutrient. The body needs iodine to make thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones help regulate metabolism.\nIodine deficiency can lead to a condition called iodine deficiency disorder. This can cause problems such as growth retardation and developmental delays. Pregnant women who are iodine deficient may have a decrease in their thyroid hormones, which can lead to problems with mental development in their babies.\nSOLUTION: Iodine is found in many foods. However, the amount of iodine in food can be affected by how the food is prepared. For example, cooking in a iodine-rich environment, such as a iodine-rich soil, can decrease the iodine content of food.\nIn central Africa, the soil is iodine-poor. In addition, people in central Africa often eat a diet that is rich in locally grown food. This can lead to a diet that is low in iodine. Eating a diet that is low in iodine can lead to iodine deficiency.\nInsufficient caloric intake means that you are not getting enough food. This can lead to malnutrition. Malnutrition can lead to a decrease in thyroid hormones. So, inadequate sunlight exposure and insufficient caloric intake can both lead to iodine deficiency.\nFruits and vegetables are important for a healthy diet. However, they are not a good source of iodine.\nSOLUTION: Inadequate sunlight exposure and insufficient caloric intake can both lead to iodine deficiency. But low intake of fruits and vegetables and inadequate sunlight exposure are not directly related to iodine deficiency."}

For example, it can increase the availability of food and help to improve market conditions for farmers. At the same time, there are also negative effects. For example, globalisation can lead to a flood of food imports that put local farmers out of business.\nSubsidies and trade barriers in wealthy countries can make it difficult for developing countries to benefit from globalisation. These barriers can include import duties and subsidies for food production. As a result, developing countries may not be able to sell their products to other countries.\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is an international organisation that sets rules for global trade. Its rules do not cover agriculture. So, globalisation does have an impact on food security. For example, the WTO allows wealthy countries to use subsidies to keep their own farmers in business. This can make it difficult for developing countries to sell their products.\nSupermarkets have played a major role in the globalisation of food and agriculture. Supermarkets can help to ensure that food is available throughout the year. At the same time, they have also contributed to the homogenisation of food. This means that food in different countries starts to look and taste the same.\nPublicly-owned food reserves can help to ensure that food is available in case of emergencies. For example, a drought in a country that relies on rain-fed agriculture could lead to a food crisis. Having food reserves could help to prevent this."}

{"question": "How many calories should a woman eat each day during pregnancy?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Less than 200 kCal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An additional 200 kCal in the third trimester only"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An additional 200 kCal throughout pregnancy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No change from pre-pregnant levels"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: During pregnancy, a woman's basal metabolic rate (BMR) increases by about 300 kCal/day, which is the amount of energy needed to maintain normal bodily functions. This increase in BMR can account for the extra calories needed during pregnancy.\nAdding an extra 200 kCal per day to the pre-pregnancy diet is recommended for most pregnant women. This additional caloric intake provides for the increased energy needs of pregnancy and supports fetal growth."}
{"question": "Which of the following will be increased in vitamin K deficiency\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The plasma concentration of calcitonin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The plasma concentration of prothrombin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The time for blood to clot"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Haemolysis due to oxidative damage to red cell membranes"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in blood clotting.\nVitamin K is produced by bacteria in the gut. It is also found in green leafy vegetables.\nVitamin K deficiency can lead to excessive bleeding.\nThe effectiveness of blood clotting can be measured by the time it takes for blood to clot. This is called the clotting time.\nThe clotting time is affected by the concentration of clotting factors. One of these clotting factors is prothrombin.\nProthrombin is a protein that is produced by the liver. Its concentration in the plasma is a measure of vitamin K status.\nThe concentration of prothrombin is directly affected by the concentration of vitamin K. When vitamin K levels are low, prothrombin levels are low. This can increase the clotting time.\nCalcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Its concentration in the plasma is not affected by vitamin K status. So, a deficiency in vitamin K would not affect the concentration of calcitonin.\nHaemolysis is the breakdown of red blood cells. This breakdown can be caused by oxidative damage to red cell membranes. Vitamin E is a vitamin that helps protect red cell membranes from oxidative damage. But vitamin E is not involved in clotting. So, a deficiency in vitamin K would not cause haemolysis."}
{"question": "Which of the following contributes to reduced energy expenditure in older adults?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A reduction in lean body mass"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A reduction in physical activity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A reduction in basal metabolic rate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Energy expenditure is a measure of the amount of energy a person uses.\nAs people age, their energy expenditure tends to decrease. This is because older adults tend to do less physical activity, and they may also lose muscle mass.\nMuscle mass is important because muscle is metabolically active tissue. This means that muscle uses energy, or metabolizes, at a higher rate than other tissues such as bone or fat.\nLean body mass is a measure of the body's total mass that is not fat. As people age, they tend to lose lean body mass.\nA reduction in lean body mass contributes to reduced energy expenditure in older adults. This means that older adults have less muscle mass, which means that their bodies use less energy.\nSOLUTION: A reduction in lean body mass contributes to reduced energy expenditure in older adults."}

{"question": "Which of the following foods might be considered a \"goitrogen\"?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fish"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Meat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rice"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brassicas"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Iodine is a nutrient that is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones. Some foods can interfere with the absorption of iodine, which can lead to thyroid problems. These foods are called goitrogens.\nGoitrogens can bind to iodine in the digestive tract and prevent it from being absorbed by the body. This can lead to lower levels of thyroid hormones. Because thyroid hormones are important for regulating metabolism, thyroid problems can affect the way your body uses food.\nThe most commonly consumed goitrogens in the United States are raw vegetables in the brassica family, which include broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and kale. Other foods that are relatively high in goitrogens include soybeans and peaches.\nSOLUTION: Brassicas are a type of vegetable that are particularly high in goitrogens. So, rice, fish, meat, and brassicas are all foods that might be considered goitrogens."}

{"question": "Food supplements, including trace minerals and vitamins are frequently advertised with promising health benefits. Which of the following substance could be consumed in excess, i.e. well above the recommended daily requirement?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vitamin C"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Vitamin D"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Zinc"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vitamin A"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: It is not necessary to consume substances in excess to experience their desired effects. The terms \"recommended daily requirement\" and \"tolerable upper intake level\" apply to all nutrients.\nA nutrient's tolerable upper intake level is the highest average daily intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the population. This level is different for each nutrient.\nFor example, the tolerable upper intake level for vitamin C is 2,000 milligrams per day. This means that consuming more than 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C per day could cause adverse health effects for most people.\nHowever, it is important to note that consuming a nutrient in excess above the tolerable upper intake level does not automatically guarantee that you will experience adverse effects.\nSOLUTION: Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin. This means that your body cannot store it. So, you need to consume vitamin C every day.\nThe recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 75-90 milligrams per day for women and 90-120 milligrams per day for men. This means that you can consume up to 90-120 milligrams of vitamin C per day without risking adverse health effects.\nConsuming more than 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C per day could cause adverse health effects, such as diarrhea and stomach cramps. So, you should not consume excess amounts of vitamin C."}

In response to the hormone gastrin, parietal cells secrete acid.\nPepsinogen is an enzyme that is secreted into the lumen, or space, of the stomach. Pepsinogen is produced by chief cells and can be transformed into its active form, pepsin, by hydrochloric acid. Pepsin then helps break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids.\nGlands called Peyer's patches are part of the immune system and are not involved in acid secretion.\nThe vagus nerve is a cranial nerve that is involved in controlling heart rate and breathing, among other things. It does not have a direct role in acid secretion.\ncarbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that helps to maintain the pH of the stomach by breaking down carbon dioxide into bicarbonate. This maintains the pH of the stomach, which allows acid to be secreted."}

Consuming 60 grams of glucose per hour is equivalent to consuming 120 grams of carbohydrates per hour. So, for elite athletes, the optimal rate of carbohydrate consumption during prolonged high-intensity exercise is 60 grams of glucose per hour, or 120 grams of carbohydrates per hour.\nConsuming 60 grams of glucose per hour will replenish glycogen stores and maintain muscle glycogen levels during prolonged high-intensity exercise.\nIf athletes need to consume more carbohydrates to meet their energy needs, they can consume fructose in addition to glucose. Fructose is a type of carbohydrate that can be used to replenish glycogen stores. Consuming 60 grams of glucose and 30 grams of fructose per hour is equivalent to consuming 120 grams of carbohydrates per hour. So, for elite athletes, consuming 90 grams of glucose and fructose per hour is the next optimal option.\nConsuming 90 grams of glucose per hour is not the next optimal option. This rate is too high, and it can lead to gastrointestinal distress.\nConsuming 90 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour is not the next optimal option. This rate is too high, and it can lead to gastrointestinal distress."}
{"question": "What endogenous substrate source provides the most energy during moderate to high intensity exercise?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Liver glycogen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Muscle glycogen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Intramuscular lipid"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Adipose tissue lipid"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: During exercise, the primary fuel for muscles is glucose, which is broken down from glycogen, a stored form of carbohydrate in muscle cells.\nThe amount of glycogen in a muscle is a function of the amount of glycogen that the muscle can hold and the amount of glycogen that is already in the muscle.\nThe amount of glycogen that a muscle can hold is called its glycogen tolerance.\nThe more glycogen that a muscle can hold, the more glycogen the muscle can use as a fuel during exercise.\nMuscle glycogen tolerance is a function of the amount of glycogen that the muscle can hold.\nMuscle glycogen tolerance increases with the amount of glycogen that the muscle already contains.\nSo, the more glycogen that a muscle contains, the more glycogen it can use as a fuel during exercise.\nThe liver is the main source of glycogen for the muscles.\nDuring exercise, the liver breaks down glycogen and releases glucose into the bloodstream.\nThe glucose is then taken up by the muscles to be used as a fuel.\nThe amount of glycogen in the liver is called its glycogen store.\nThe glycogen store in the liver is a function of the amount of glycogen that the liver can hold and the amount of glycogen that is already in the liver.\nThe more glycogen that the liver can hold, the more glycogen it can use as a fuel for the muscles.\nThe glycogen store in the liver increases with the amount of glycogen that the liver already contains.\nSo, the more glycogen that the liver contains, the more glycogen it can use as a fuel for the muscles.\nIntramuscular lipid is a fat stored in muscle cells.\nDuring moderate to high intensity exercise, intramuscular lipid is not a significant fuel source.\nDuring exercise, adipose tissue lipid is broken down into free fatty acids and released into the bloodstream.\nThe free fatty acids are taken up by the muscles to be used as a fuel.\nThe amount of lipid in adipose tissue is called its lipid store.\nThe lipid store in adipose tissue is a function of the amount of lipid that the adipose tissue can hold and the amount of lipid that is already in the adipose tissue.\nThe more lipid that the adipose tissue can hold, the more lipid it can use as a fuel during exercise.\nThe lipid store in adipose tissue increases with the amount of lipid that the adipose tissue already contains.\nSo, the more lipid that the adipose tissue contains, the more lipid it can use as a fuel during exercise."}
{"question": "How does agricultural research help reduce hunger and poverty?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Transnational private-sector firms are the main source of research oriented towards poor farmers and consumers."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Agricultural research mainly benefits commercial farmers in developed countries."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a 'public good' with little profit potential but high social benefits; public investment is needed to support it."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pro-poor research should only focus on organic farming."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Agricultural research can help reduce hunger and poverty by improving the productivity and profitability of farming. This research can focus on the needs of poor farmers and consumers, who often face greater challenges than commercial farmers. When research leads to new farming techniques or crop varieties, it can help poor farmers grow more food and earn more income.\nOrganic farming is one approach to agriculture. While it has some potential benefits, it also has limitations. For example, organic farming may be less productive than conventional farming. So, it may not be the best way to help poor farmers.\nTransnational private-sector firms can also do research. But their main customers are often large farmers in developed countries. So, they are not the main source of research oriented towards poor farmers and consumers.\nPublic investment in research can help fill the gap. Research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a public good. This means that it has little profit potential but can provide large social benefits. So, public investment is needed to support this research."}

It was influential in the European colonial era.\nMany developing countries have continued to use mercantilist policies, which often include using import substitution industrialization (ISI) to try to promote economic growth. ISI involves using high tariffs to protect domestic industry and using government subsidies to promote the growth of these industries.\nThese policies can make a country less dependent on imports and can help promote the growth of local industries. But they can also raise the cost of goods for consumers and make it harder for other countries to compete in the domestic market."}
