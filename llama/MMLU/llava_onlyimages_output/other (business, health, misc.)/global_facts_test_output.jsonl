It is a good measure of the average standard of living of the people in a country.\nGDP per capita in the United States in 1850 was about $300 in 2011 prices.\nTo calculate the effect of inflation on the GDP per capita in 1850, you need to use the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI measures the average change in prices over time. If the CPI is used to adjust for inflation, the GDP per capita in 1850 is lower than it would have been if inflation had not occurred.\nTo calculate the effect of inflation on the GDP per capita in 1850, use the following formula:\nInflation-adjusted GDP per capita = GDP per capita / (CPI in 2011 / CPI in 1850)\nThe CPI in 2011 was 226.436. The CPI in 1850 is unknown, but it is estimated to be 10.\nInflation-adjusted GDP per capita = $300 / (226.436 / 10) = $3,000,000 / 22.6436 = $133.04"}

For the United States, this was $43,674.\nThe World Bank also provides a feature to convert 2011 GDP per capita to 2011 international dollars. To use this feature, go to the 2011 data and select the United States. Then, scroll down to the \"convert to\" section and select 2011 international dollars. The 1950 GDP per capita was $3,326 in international dollars.\nTo convert from international dollars to 2011 prices, multiply by the exchange rate. The exchange rate for 2011 was 0.76. So, $3,326 x 0.76 = $2,534.\nTo adjust for PPP, compare the 2011 GDP per capita in international dollars to the 2011 GDP per capita in constant prices. The World Bank provides a feature to convert between these two measures. To use this feature, go to the 2011 data and select the United States. Then, scroll down to the \"convert to\" section and select constant 2011 prices. The 2011 GDP per capita in constant prices was $43,674. So, $43,674 / $2,534 = 17.0.\nFinally, multiply the result by the 1950 GDP per capita to get an estimate of the 2011 GDP per capita in 1950. This is the same as adjusting for both inflation and PPP.\nAn inflation rate of 3% per year is a reasonable estimate for the United States from 1950 to 2011. So, the GDP per capita in 1950 was $15,590 in 2011 prices."}

These studies are based on data from many countries and are modeled to estimate the number of deaths and disabilities from different diseases and injuries.\nOne of the measures used in global burden of disease studies is disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). A DALY is a measure of both the number of years of life lost to premature death and the number of years lived with disability.\nDALYs can be used to compare the impact of different diseases and injuries. For example, in 2017, diarrheal diseases caused about 500,000 deaths worldwide, and road injuries caused about 1.3 million deaths worldwide. But because road injuries often cause more severe disability, the overall impact of road injuries was about 2.3 times greater than the overall impact of diarrheal diseases, even though road injuries caused more deaths.\nSOLUTION: As of 2017, diabetes caused more deaths globally than dementia or road injuries."}

One of the competing hypotheses is that inequality first increases with development, then decreases with further development. This pattern is sometimes referred to as the \"inverted-U hypothesis.\"\nThe inverted-U hypothesis is based on the idea that inequality is a function of the extent of market exchange and that market exchange expands with development. According to this hypothesis, inequality increases as market exchange expands, reaches a peak, and then decreases as market exchange expands further.\nEmpirical studies have tested the inverted-U hypothesis by examining cross-section and time-series data. Cross-section studies compare inequality across countries at a single point in time, while time-series studies examine changes in inequality over time.\nThe evidence that supports the inverted-U hypothesis is mainly based on cross-section studies. For example, Figure 1 shows that among 54 countries with data in 1995 and 2005, 53 had a higher Gini index in 2005 than in 1995. This pattern is consistent with the inverted-U hypothesis.\nHowever, the cross-section studies do not provide evidence on whether inequality first increases, then decreases. They only provide evidence that inequality increases with development.\nThe time-series studies provide more direct evidence on the inverted-U hypothesis. For example, Figure 1 shows that the United States had a higher Gini index in 2004 than in 1992, but a lower index in 2004 than in 1960. This pattern is consistent with the inverted-U hypothesis.\nOverall, the available evidence supports the idea that inequality first increases, then decreases with development. However, the evidence is not as strong as that for the positive association between inequality and development.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C."}

It does not refer to war crimes or atrocities committed by other countries or groups.\nThe United States entered World War II in 1941. By 1943, many Americans had learned of the atrocities being committed by the Nazis. But it is important to note that many Americans did not learn about the Holocaust until after the war.\nThe Holocaust was not a widely known or accepted fact in 1943. It is possible that 30% of Americans believed in the Holocaust in 1943. But it is also possible that the number was higher or lower."}

This is an average of one death every 40 seconds.\nThe total number of deaths in 2017 was 58 million.\nSo, the estimated percentage of global deaths by suicide is:\n0.70% is less than 1.40%, so 0.70% is the answer."}

Many countries became nations with different ethnic groups and languages. For example, Belgium's colony in Africa became the country of Congo. When Congo became independent, it included dozens of different tribes and languages.\nInadequate access to higher education and training for nationals was a serious hindrance to economic development. When a country is trying to develop, it needs people with advanced skills. For example, South Korea and Taiwan used education and training to develop their economies.\nControl of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups was a hindrance to economic development. When a small group controls a country's economy, it can be difficult to create economic growth.\nMany countries that became independent after World War II found that the legacy of colonialism hindered their economic development. The list of hindrances included artificial political boundaries that covered diverse ethnic groups with little in common, inadequate access to higher education and training for nationals under the colonial administration, control of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups which had been brought in by the colonial power, and all of the above."}
