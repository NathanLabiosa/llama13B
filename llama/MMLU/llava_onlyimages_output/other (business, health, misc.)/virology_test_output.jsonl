{"question": "Which of the following is an unusual feature of the replication cycle in coronaviruses?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The RNAs all terminate in a common 3\u00b4 and produce nested set transcripts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They take advantage of recombination with the long RNA genome"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are not highly mutable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They use capped cellular mRNA's"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Coronaviruses have an unusual replication cycle that takes advantage of their RNA genome. Like other RNA viruses, coronaviruses replicate their RNA in cells. Unlike most other RNA viruses, coronaviruses have a genome that is much longer than the average RNA virus. Their genome is also highly conserved, which means that it is the same across many different coronavirus species. Conserved genes are more likely to be essential to the virus, so this conservation suggests that the functions of the genes in coronaviruses are important to the virus.\nOne unusual feature of the replication cycle in coronaviruses is that they take advantage of recombination with the long RNA genome. Recombination is a process that involves exchanging genetic material between two organisms. In the case of coronaviruses, recombination involves exchanging genetic material between the coronavirus genome and the host cell genome. This process can create new combinations of genes in the coronavirus genome.\nAnother unusual feature of the replication cycle in coronaviruses is that they are not highly mutable. Mutable means changeable. So, a highly mutable virus is one that can easily change its genes. For a virus, being mutable can be an advantage because it allows the virus to adapt to changes in the host organism. But being highly mutable can also be a disadvantage because it can make the virus less stable."}

Cytoplasmic replication is a strategy used by some viruses. To use this strategy, a virus must be able to reproduce its genetic material in the cytoplasm.\nCytoplasmic replication occurs in cytoplasmic tubules. Cytoplasmic tubules are structures that are formed by some viruses. They are made of protein and are found in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The replication of some viruses is parallelled by the formation of cytoplasmic tubules.\nSome viruses use a strategy called \"snatched caps.\" This strategy is used by viruses that have icosahedral capsids. A capsid is a protective shell. It is made of protein and surrounds the virus's genetic material.\nThe capsid of some viruses has a specialized layer called the inner capsid. The inner capsid is made of protein and helps to replicate the virus's genetic material. When the virus is ready to leave the host cell, the inner capsid helps to create a hole in the host cell's membrane. This hole is called a pore. The pore allows the virus to exit the host cell.\nMany large double-stranded viruses use a strategy called \"transcription to mRNA.\" This strategy is used by viruses that have cylindrical or helical nucleocapsids. A nucleocapsid is a protein shell that surrounds the virus's genetic material.\nThe transcription to mRNA strategy means that the virus uses its own genetic material to make mRNA. mRNA is a type of RNA that can be used by the host cell's ribosomes to make proteins.\nSome viruses use a strategy called \"replication to mRNA.\" This strategy is used by viruses that have icosahedral capsids.\nWhen a virus uses the replication to mRNA strategy, it makes RNA copies of its genetic material. These RNA copies are used as templates to make mRNA. The mRNA can be used by the host cell's ribosomes to make proteins."}

A cohort study is a type of retrospective study. It looks back at what happened to a group of people who were exposed and a group who were not exposed.\nOne of the key elements of a cohort study is that the exposure and outcome assessments are made at the same point in time. This is in contrast to a case-control study, which looks back at exposures and outcomes.\nIt is useful to consider the following example. Imagine that researchers want to look at whether exposure to pollutants affects respiratory health. They collect data from two groups of people: people who live in an area with high levels of pollutants and people who live in an area with low levels of pollutants. Then, they assess the respiratory health of each group.\nIn a cohort study, the researchers assess the respiratory health of each group at the same time.\nIn a case-control study, the researchers assess the respiratory health of the groups at different times.\nThe term \"retrospective\" may be used to describe both cohort and case-control studies. But in a cohort study, the researchers start with a group of people who have something in common. They follow that group over time and assess what happens to the people in the group.\nIn a case-control study, the researchers start with an outcome. They look back to see if there is any difference in the exposures of the people who experienced the outcome and the people who did not experience the outcome.\nSOLUTION: In this study, the researchers asked 500 women about their meat consumption and then looked back to see which women developed colorectal cancer. So, the study is a cohort study."}

Pathogenicity can be increased by several processes.\nMutation of the RNA genome at only a few positions: Mutations in the RNA genome of a virus can change the virus's proteins. These changes can increase the virus's pathogenicity.\nRecombining with another enterovirus: Recombination is the exchange of genetic material between two organisms. This process can produce a virus with increased pathogenicity.\nAltering its protein coat: The protein coat of a virus covers its RNA genome. Altering the protein coat can change the way the virus infects cells. This change can increase the virus's pathogenicity.\nMultiple nucleotide deletions and substitutions: Multiple nucleotide deletions and substitutions in the RNA genome of a virus can change the virus's proteins. These changes can increase the virus's pathogenicity."}

{"question": "Why are drug combinations essential for HIV?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Single drugs are not completely inhibitory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mutations negate the effect of one drug"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Combinations of antibiotics are effective versus TB"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The virus cannot mutate vs a combination"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Drug combinations are essential for HIV because single drugs are not completely inhibitory.\nWhen cells are infected with HIV, the virus produces proteins called protease and reverse transcriptase. These proteins are responsible for breaking down the immune system's cells and reproducing the virus. Drugs called protease inhibitors and reverse transcriptase inhibitors can block these proteins' functions.\nSingle drugs that block protease or reverse transcriptase can increase the levels of other proteins that the virus needs to reproduce. So, the virus can mutate, or change, its proteins in a way that allows it to overcome the block action of a single drug. But if you use multiple drugs that block protease and reverse transcriptase, the virus cannot mutate to overcome the block action of all of the drugs at once."}

The most common way for a virus to kill a cell is by fragmenting its DNA. Viruses do this by using a type of enzyme called a reverse transcriptase.\nReverse transcriptase is an enzyme that can make a copy of a virus's RNA genome and turn it into a DNA genome. The virus can then insert its DNA genome into a host cell's genome. The viral DNA may land in a gene that tells the host cell to produce a protein called a viral integrase. The integrase can then put the viral DNA into a specific location in the host cell's genome. This location is called an integration site.\nIntegration is a permanent change to a cell's genome. It can cause genes to be turned on or off, or produce proteins that are not needed. Over time, this can cause the cell to become cancerous.\nSOLUTION: Caspases are enzymes that help cells undergo apoptosis, or cell death. Apoptosis is a series of events that can include fragmentation of DNA. But fragmenting DNA is not the most common way for a virus to kill a cell.\nBlocking transcription is not a way viruses kill cells. Transcription is the process of making a copy of a gene's DNA into a molecule of RNA.\nAs mentioned earlier, viruses can kill cells by fragmenting their DNA. So, fragmenting cellular DNA is the most common way for a virus to kill a cell."}

Genetics is the study of how genes affect the traits of an organism. A gene is a unit of heredity. It is located on a chromosome.\nGenetic recombination is a process that involves exchanging genetic material between two organisms. This process can produce offspring with genetic traits that are different from those of the parent organisms.\nRapid adsorption and fusion from without via a hydrophobic peptide describes how the influenza virus infects a cell. This process is known to involve the viral hemagglutinin protein.\nThe high fidelity RNA replicase enzyme describes how the influenza virus makes many copies of its genes. This process is error-prone, which means that mistakes can be made during replication.\nGenetic reassortment amongst 8 genes, on the other hand, describes how the influenza virus's genetics can change. This process involves swapping pieces of genetic material between different copies of the virus's eight genes."}

It is a measure of the virus's contagiousness.\nA virus's reproductive number can be used to calculate the total number of people who will get the disease.\nIf a virus's reproductive number is above 1, the virus will spread. If it is below 1, the virus will not spread.\nThe reproductive number can also be used to find the incubation period.\nThe incubation period is the time it takes for a person to develop symptoms of a disease after being infected. This time can be used to calculate the reproductive number.\nFor example, if the incubation period is 3 days, and the reproductive number is 2, then the disease will spread. This means that on average, a person with the disease will infect 2 other people. If the reproductive number is less than 2, the disease will not spread."}

{"question": "There is no vaccine against HIV because of which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The virus is so antigenically variable"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Such a vaccine would be too expensive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The virus can be controlled by a change in sexual habits"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Latency can abrogate any vaccine effect"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: A vaccine is a preventative measure. To prevent a disease, a vaccine must be given before the virus can infect the host. Vaccines work by priming the immune system to quickly recognize and attack the virus if the host is later exposed to the virus.\nBecause HIV is a virus, a vaccine is possible. But there is no vaccine today. This is because of the following reasons:\nThe virus is so antigenically variable.\nHIV has many different types. A vaccine that works against one type of HIV might not work against another type.\nSuch a vaccine would be too expensive.\nA vaccine that is not effective would be a waste of money.\nThe virus can be controlled by a change in sexual habits.\nHIV is a sexually transmitted virus. Changes in sexual habits can help prevent the spread of HIV. But a vaccine is necessary in addition to changes in sexual habits in order to control the virus.\nLatency can abrogate any vaccine effect.\nLatency means that the virus is present in the body in a dormant state. Since a vaccine cannot be given before the virus infects the host, a vaccine would not be able to prevent the virus from entering its latent state."}

Surveillance testing strategies can involve different levels of selection bias.\nCompulsory testing is a strategy in which individuals are required to participate in a study or use a product or service. This strategy can result in high participation rates, but those who participate may not be representative of the larger population. For example, those who are more motivated or concerned about the issue being studied may be more likely to participate.\nUnlinked anonymous testing is a strategy in which individuals can choose whether or not to participate in a study, and their responses are anonymous so that they cannot be linked to individual participants. This strategy can reduce selection bias by allowing individuals to participate at their own convenience and by removing the possibility of linkage to individuals.\nVoluntary anonymous testing is a strategy in which individuals can choose whether or not to participate in a study, and their responses are anonymous so that they cannot be linked to individual participants. This strategy can reduce selection bias by allowing individuals to participate at their own convenience and by removing the possibility of linkage to individuals.\nVoluntary confidential testing is a strategy in which individuals can choose whether or not to participate in a study, and their responses are anonymous but can be linked to individual participants for the purpose of obtaining test results.

For example, the mean of the five highest test scores in a class is a biased estimator of the population mean. It is biased because it is based on a sample of five scores instead of the entire population.\nHowever, the sample mean is still a good estimator of the population mean. This is because the sample mean is a least biased estimator of the population mean. This means that, for a given sample size, the sample mean is the best estimator of the population mean.\nSOLUTION: The median is the middle score in a distribution. It is a good measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, which have a long tail on one side. Such distributions have a median that is different from the mean.\nFor a sample to be a good estimator of the median, the sample must be sorted in order. Then, the median is the middle score.\nThe mode is the most common score in a distribution. It is a measure of central tendency that is not affected by skewness.\nFor a sample to be a good estimator of the mode, the sample does not need to be sorted in order. The mode is the score that occurs most frequently.\nThe standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the distribution. It can be used to describe the variability of the scores.\nThe standard deviation is a biased estimator of the population standard deviation. This means that, for a given sample size, the standard deviation is a less accurate estimator of the population standard deviation than the sample mean is a estimator of the population mean."}

{"question": "Which of the following are goals of vaccination?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prevent infection"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Prevent disease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prevent transmission"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Goals of vaccination include preventing infection, preventing disease, and preventing transmission.\nVaccines train the immune system to recognize and defend against specific pathogens. This can prevent the vaccinated individual from getting the disease, or it may reduce the severity of the disease if the individual is infected.\nVaccines can also prevent the spread of infectious diseases to others. This is known as herd immunity."}
{"question": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Placebo effect"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Recall bias"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Non-compliance"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Effect modification (interaction)"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Randomization is the process of assigning study subjects to groups by chance. In a clinical trial, randomization is used to assign subjects to groups that compare different treatments.\nControlling for certain factors can help ensure that the results of a clinical trial are accurate. For example, randomization can help control for the following factors:\n* Recall bias: Repeat measurements of exposure or outcome can introduce recall bias.\n* Non-compliance: Different groups of subjects may have different levels of non-compliance.\n* Effect modification (interaction): Certain subgroups of subjects may respond differently to the treatments.\n* Placebo effect: The placebo effect occurs when subjects in a clinical trial improve because they believe they are receiving a treatment.\n * Compliance: The degree to which subjects follow the treatment instructions may affect the results of a clinical trial.\nSOLUTION: Randomization of study subjects can help control for the following factors:\nnon-compliance, effect modification, and placebo effect. Randomization does not directly control for recall bias or compliance."}

Like all viruses, rotavirus has a genetic structure that is different from that of cells of multicellular organisms.\nRotavirus has a segmented genome, which means that it is made up of several pieces of genetic material. Each piece of genetic material is a segment. Each segment contains one or more genes.\nThe segments are bound together by intersegment bridges. When the virus infects a cell, the segments are separated from each other, and the genes are copied into the cell's own genome. This process is called gene transfer."}

This type of therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission among people who inject drugs.\nOne of the benefits of opioid replacement therapy is reducing the frequency of injection drug use. When patients receive opioid replacement therapy, they are able to manage their cravings for illicit opioids. This allows patients to focus on other aspects of their lives, including their health. As a result, patients may inject drugs less frequently.\nAnother benefit of opioid replacement therapy is reducing the sharing of injecting paraphernalia. One of the ways that people who inject drugs can contract HIV is by sharing needles and other injection paraphernalia. Opioid replacement therapy can reduce the sharing of injection paraphernalia by reducing the frequency of injection drug use.\nReducing the frequency of injection drug use and reducing the sharing of injection paraphernalia are both important HIV prevention strategies."}
