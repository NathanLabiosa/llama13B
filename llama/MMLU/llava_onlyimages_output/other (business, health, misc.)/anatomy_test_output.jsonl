The inferior branch controls the muscles that move the vocal folds up and down. The superior branch controls the muscles that move the vocal folds from side to side.\nDamage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve can cause difficulty speaking and singing. The exact pattern of vocal fold movement after nerve damage is important in determining the type of vocal cord injury.\nWhen the inferior branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is damaged, the vocal folds do not move up and down as well. This type of injury is called an abductant type vocal cord injury. The vocal folds remain in an abducted position because the superior branch of the nerve is still functional.\nWhen the superior branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is damaged, the vocal folds do not move from side to side as well. This type of injury is called an adductant type vocal cord injury. The vocal folds remain in an adducted position because the inferior branch of the nerve is still functional.\nIf both branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve are damaged, the vocal folds are affected in both the up-and-down and side-to-side movements. This type of injury is called a mixed type vocal cord injury.\nSOLUTION: The choice of a paralyzed cricothyroid muscle but functional interarytenoid muscles as the cause of a laryngeal examination showing the vocal fold on the injured side in an intermediate position is incorrect.\nIf the cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed, the vocal folds are displaced downward. The vocal folds may be in an abducted position or a semi-abducted position, but they are not in an intermediate position between abduction and adduction.\nIf the cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed, the patient may have difficulty swallowing.

One part of swallowing is called the pharyngeal phase. During the pharyngeal phase, food is moved from the oral cavity to the esophagus.\nThe larynx, or voice box, is located just above the entrance to the trachea, or windpipe. One of the functions of the larynx is to prevent food from entering the trachea. This is done by constricting the opening to the larynx.\nThe epiglottis is a flap of tissue located at the base of the larynx. When you swallow, the epiglottis moves upward to cover the larynx. This prevents food from entering the larynx and trachea.\nThe larynx is made of cartilage. It is not directly attached to any other bones. Instead, it is suspended by muscles and ligaments.\nThe increase in respiratory rate does not prevent food from entering the larynx."}

It prevents food and stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus.\nThe incompetence of the esophageal sphincter is a condition in which the muscle does not function properly. This can allow food and stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, a condition known as gastroesophageal reflux.\nThere are several conditions that can be characterized by incompetence of the esophageal sphincter. One of these is gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. GERD is a chronic condition in which the incompetence of the esophageal sphincter leads to repeated episodes of gastroesophageal reflux.\nAnother condition that can be characterized by incompetence of the esophageal sphincter is pyloric stenosis. In pyloric stenosis, the muscle in the pylorus, the area between the stomach and small intestine, thickens and becomes inflamed. This can prevent the stomach from emptying properly.\nEsophageal varices are dilated, or enlarged, veins in the esophagus. They can occur when the blood flow to the esophagus is increased. This may be caused by portal hypertension, which is increased pressure in the portal vein. The portal vein carries blood from the intestines and spleen to the liver.\nCrohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. It can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. Crohn's disease can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss."}
