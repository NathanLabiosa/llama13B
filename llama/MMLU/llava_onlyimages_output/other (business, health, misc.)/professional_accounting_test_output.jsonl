Reporting the purchase of merchandise before year end increases Arno's liabilities.\nThe understated effect is the amount of the liability that was not recorded. The liability was not recorded in its entirety, so the amount that was not recorded is the understated effect.\nThe understated effect is an estimate. The understated effect is an estimate of the amount of the liability that was not recorded. This estimate is based on the amount of the liability that was included in the physical inventory.\nThe understated effect is a misleading estimate.

The effect of using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium is to understate interest expense in earlier years and overstate it in later years.\nThe straight-line method takes the same amount of interest expense in each year. So, in the earlier years, the bond is carried at a higher value than it would be if the effective interest method were used. This means that interest expense is understated.\nIn the later years, the bond is carried at a lower value than it would be if the effective interest method were used. This means that interest expense is overstated.\nSOLUTION: At June 30 year 12, the bond is carried at a higher value than it would be if the effective interest method were used. So, the error overstates interest expense.\nThe error also affects the retained earnings. The error results in lower interest expense and higher earnings than would have been reported if the effective interest method had been used. So, the error understates the retained earnings."}

So, when a bond's yield is higher than its coupon rate, the bond's price is higher than its face value.\nWhen a bond pays coupons at a rate of 5%, its price will be equal to the sum of its face value and 5% of its face value for each year it has been outstanding. So, the price of a three-year bond paying 5% coupons will be equal to:\n$100 + (5% of $100) for 3 years = $104.29\nHowever, the yield is 6%, which is higher than the bond's coupon rate of 5%. So, the bond's price will be higher than its face value.\nThe bond's price will be equal to the present value of its future coupons, which is equal to the present value of its future face value.

A purchase option is a provision in a lease that gives the lessee the right to buy the asset leased at the end of the lease term.\nWhen the lease has a purchase option, the lease is evaluated under both the operating lease classification and the financing lease classification.\nIf the lease is classified as a financing lease, the lease is initially recorded as a liability. The liability will be reduced by the lease payments, and the asset will be recorded at the present value of the lease payments.\nIf the lease is classified as an operating lease, the lease is not recorded on the balance sheet. Instead, the lease is recorded as an expense on the income statement.\nThe key difference between the two classifications is whether the lease is considered a purchase option.\nA financing lease is a lease with a purchase option. As a result, at the end of the lease term, the lessee can buy the asset for a nominal amount.\nAn operating lease is not a lease with a purchase option. As a result, at the end of the lease term, the lessee does not have the right to buy the asset.\nThe gain on the exchange is the difference between the value of the machinery and the value of the land.

Consideration is usually money, but it can also be a promise to perform a service, such as promise to pay a premium on an insurance contract.\nIn the case of an insurance contract, the purchase of the contract is a gift of property. The taxpayer makes the gift of the insurance contract by purchasing it and designating his children as beneficiaries. The taxpayer's payment of the premiums is also a gift of property.\nThe taxpayer's payment of the premiums is a gift of property because the taxpayer is making the payment to a third party, the insurance company, for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The payment is not a gift of property if the taxpayer is paying the premiums for his own benefit, such as taking out a life insurance policy on himself.\nThe value of the gift of the insurance contract and the payment of the premiums is not taxable as a gift for gift tax purposes.

These responses, or controls, are designed to prevent, detect, and correct any events that could prevent the organization from achieving its objectives.\nControls are classified as either preventive or detective. Preventive controls are designed to prevent events from occurring. Detective controls are designed to identify events that have already occurred.\nThe effectiveness of the internal control process is evaluated by assessing whether the controls are present and functioning as intended. This evaluation can be accomplished, in part, by conducting risk assessments and by testing the operating effectiveness of controls.\nThe results of the evaluation should be communicated to the organization's management, and the organization's audit committee or other relevant parties. Deficiencies identified through this evaluation should be followed up with appropriate corrective action."}

A debt security is a agreement between a borrower and a lender. The borrower gets a loan from the lender and agrees to pay the lender interest on the loan.\nWhen you buy a bond, the borrower promises to pay you interest. The bond will also pay back the principal amount of the loan on a later date.\nInterest payment dates are the dates on which the borrower pays interest to the lender. The interest payment dates are determined when the bond is issued.\nA bond with a coupon interest rate of 6% has interest payment dates of April 1 and October 1. This means that the borrower will pay interest to the lender on April 1 and October 1.\nThe bond will make its first interest payment on April 1, 2021. This interest payment will cover the period from June 1, 2020 to April 1, 2021.\nThe bond will make its second interest payment on October 1, 2021. This interest payment will cover the period from April 1, 2021 to October 1, 2021.\nSOLUTION: To determine the bond interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, calculate the interest that accrues from June 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021.\nThe bond has a coupon interest rate of 6%. The interest payment dates are April 1 and October 1. So, the bond has 2 interest payment dates per year.\nTo calculate the bond interest expense, multiply the bond's face value by the coupon interest rate and the number of interest payment dates in a year.\nThe bond has a face value of $1,000. So, the bond interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 is:\n$1,000 x 6% x 2/12 = $30."}

This technique can be useful in reducing the size of a sample while still giving the auditor reasonable assurance that the sample is representative of the population.\nStratification is typically used when the auditor wants to ensure that the sample includes a specific proportion of the population, or when the auditor wants to ensure that the sample is representative of certain parts of the population.\nFor example, suppose an auditor is conducting a test of controls for a company's sales department. The sales department has three geographic regions, and the auditor wants to ensure that the sample includes a specific proportion of sales from each region. In this case, the auditor could stratify the population by region and take a sample of sales from each region, in proportion to the size of the region.\nIf the auditor suspects that management fraud has occurred during the year, the auditor may want to use sampling techniques that are designed to detect fraud. These techniques, such as attribute sampling, may require a larger sample than other techniques.\nIf the desired assistant level of control risk is less than the prior year, the auditor may need to use a larger sample to achieve the same level of assistant. This may be due to the fact that a lower assistant level means that the auditor is willing to accept a higher level of error in the audit.\nGiving greater representation to large recorded amounts may not affect the auditor's decision to use stratification. This technique can still be used to select a sample that is representative of the population, even if the emphasis is on large recorded amounts."}

This classification tells you how soon the items are due. Current items are due within one year. Long-term items are due after one year.\nSOLUTION: As of December 1, year 2, the company has a $1,000,000 line of credit and has drawn $250,000 on it. The line of credit is a current liability, as it is due within one year. The company also has a $300,000 balloon note, which is a long-term liability.

A sales budget is a plan for the sales of a company for a future period. A production budget is a plan for the production of materials, goods, and services for a future period. A budget is a set of figures that show what a company expects to have happen during a period. These figures may include amounts of money, quantities of materials, or numbers of employees.\nBudgets are important because they help companies plan for the future. A budget may include both what a company hopes will happen and what a company thinks will happen. This allows the company to plan for both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.\nBudgets are flexible tools. Companies can use budgets to make decisions. For example, a company might use its budget to decide how much to spend on advertising. Or, a company might use its budget to decide how much to invest in new equipment.\nBudgets can be broken down into smaller budgets. A budget for a company as a whole might be difficult to work with. So, companies break their budgets down into smaller budgets for specific parts of the company. For example, a company's budget for sales might include budgets for sales of different products.\nA company's production budget shows the quantities of materials, goods, and services that the company plans to produce. A key part of a production budget is the budgeted units of production. The budgeted units of production show how many units the company plans to produce.\nThe quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of each quarter is to equal 30% of the next quarter's budgeted sales of units. This means that the company plans to have 30% more finished goods inventory at the end of the next quarter than at the end of the current quarter.\nTo keep the quantity of finished goods inventory at the desired level, the production budget must show the right quantity of units to be produced during the first quarter. To find this quantity, look at the desired ending finished goods inventory and the percentage that 30% is of the budgeted units for the next quarter.\nFirst, calculate 30% of the budgeted units for the next quarter. Then, add this amount to the ending finished goods inventory from the previous quarter. This gives the quantity of units to be produced during the first quarter.\nThe quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of the first quarter is 30% of the budgeted units for the first quarter, plus the ending finished goods inventory from the fourth quarter.\nThe ending finished goods inventory from the fourth quarter is 27500 units.\nTo calculate the budgeted units for the first quarter, multiply the desired ending finished goods inventory by the percentage that 30% is of the budgeted units for the next quarter.\nThe desired ending finished goods inventory is 24000 units. This is equal to 30% of the budgeted units for the second quarter.\nSo, the budgeted units for the first quarter are 24000 units."}
{"question": "Johnson worked for ABC Co. and earned a salary of $100,000. Johnson also received, as a fringe benefit, group termlife insurance at twice Johnson\u2019s salary. The annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000.

The annual uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000 of insurance. This means that the cost of the group term life insurance is the same for all employees, regardless of their salary.\nThe value of the fringe benefit is determined by multiplying the uniform cost of insurance by the employee's salary. This means that an employee with a higher salary will receive a greater value from the fringe benefit.\nFor example, an employee with a salary of $50,000 will receive a fringe benefit value of $2.76 per $1,000 x $50,000 = $138.\nThe amount that an employee must include in gross income is the value of the fringe benefit. This means that the employee must include the amount that the employer paid for the group term life insurance as income.\nFor example, if an employee's salary is $50,000 and the employer paid $40,000 for the group term life insurance, the employee must include the $40,000 in gross income.\nSOLUTION: Johnson earned a salary of $100,000 and received group term life insurance at twice Johnson's salary. So, the value of the fringe benefit is $2.76 per $1,000 x $100,000 = $276.\nThe amount that Johnson must include in gross income is $276."}

The theoretical value of a warrant is difficult to calculate because there is no market for most warrants.\nOne way to estimate the theoretical value of a warrant is to use an option pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes model. This model takes into account the price of the underlying stock, the exercise price of the warrant, the current market price of the warrant, the expected volatility of the stock, and the time until the warrant expires.\nIf a warrant carries a right to buy one share of common stock and is exercisable at $20 per common share while the market price of a share is $30, the theoretical value of the warrant is $5.00.\nThe market price of a warrant is the price that a buyer is willing to pay for the warrant. This price is determined by the market forces of supply and demand. The market price of a warrant may be higher or lower than its theoretical value.\nSOLUTION: To calculate the theoretical value of the warrant, you need to use the Black-Scholes model.\nThe Black-Scholes model uses the following variables:\nThe current market price of the warrant is $10.00.\nThe exercise price of the warrant is $20.00.\nThe market price of a share of common stock is $30.00.\nThe expected volatility of the stock is 0.25.\nThe time until the warrant expires is 2 years.\nPlugging in these values into the Black-Scholes formula, you get:\nTheoretical value of the warrant = $5.00"}
{"question": "Which of the following sampling methods would an auditor use to estimate a numerical measurement of a population such as the dollar value of inventory?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Variable sampling."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Discovery sampling."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Attribute sampling."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Random-number sampling."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: An auditor may use one of several types of sampling to gather evidence.\nOne type of sampling is called attribute sampling. In attribute sampling, the auditor samples one or more attributes, or parts, of each item in the population. For example, an auditor reviewing a population of 1,000 financial transactions might choose to sample 100 transactions to determine whether any transactions contained errors. In this case, the attribute being sampled is the accuracy of each transaction.\nAnother type of sampling is called variable sampling. In variable sampling, the auditor samples different variables, or parts of the population, each time they gather evidence. For example, an auditor reviewing a population of 1,000 financial transactions might choose to sample 10 transactions the first time they review the population, and then sample 20 transactions the next time. In this case, the variables being sampled are different groups of transactions.\nA third type of sampling is called discovery sampling. In discovery sampling, the auditor uses a pre-determined formula to decide which items to sample. For example, an auditor reviewing a population of 1,000 financial transactions might choose to sample every 10th transaction.\nA fourth type of sampling is called random-number sampling. In random-number sampling, the auditor uses a random number generator to determine which items to sample. For example, an auditor reviewing a population of 1,000 financial transactions might choose to sample transactions 15, 25, 35, and 45.\nSOLUTION: To estimate a numerical measurement of a population, such as the dollar value of inventory, an auditor would use variable sampling. In variable sampling, the auditor samples different variables, or parts of the population, each time they gather evidence. This means that the auditor will sample different items each time they take a sample."}

One of the areas an auditor may examine is the company's depreciation account.\nDepreciation is an accounting technique that represents the decline in the value of an asset over time. Depreciation is usually expressed as a percentage of the asset's initial cost.\nThe accumulated depreciation account is a running total of the depreciation expense for each asset. As an asset's depreciation expense is added to the accumulated depreciation account, the asset's book value is reduced.\nSOLUTION: An auditor may question management about significant debits to the accumulated depreciation account in the current year. One reason for the debit is an erroneous understatement of depreciation expense in a prior year. In this case, depreciation expense in prior years was lower than it should have been. So, management increased the depreciation expense in the current year to correct the error.\nAnother reason for the debit to the accumulated depreciation account is an erroneous understatement of the current year's depreciation expense. In this case, depreciation expense in the current year was lower than it should have been. So, management increased the current year's depreciation expense to correct the error.\nIncreasing the estimated remaining useful lives of the plant assets does not result in a debit to the accumulated depreciation account. This explanation is incorrect.\nRetiring plant assets during the current year does not involve a debit to the accumulated depreciation account. This explanation is incorrect."}

{"question": "Which of the following pricing policies results in establishment of a price to external customers higher than the competitive price for a given industry?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Collusive pricing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dual pricing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Predatory pricing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Transfer pricing"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In the long run, a pricing policy that results in a price higher than the competitive price for a given industry will result in a lower quantity sold than the competitive level. So, for this type of pricing policy to be sustainable, the additional revenue from the higher price must be greater than the reduced revenue from the lower quantity sold.\nIf the additional revenue is greater than the reduced revenue, the pricing policy will result in an increase in the industry's profit level. This means that the pricing policy is sustainable in the long run.\nIf the additional revenue is less than or equal to the reduced revenue, the pricing policy will not result in an increase in the industry's profit level. This means that the pricing policy is not sustainable in the long run.\nSOLUTION: Look at the answer choices.\nCollusive pricing involves setting prices through collusion. So, the price is the same for all firms in the industry. This means that the price is at the competitive level. So, collusive pricing does not result in a price higher than the competitive price.\nDual pricing involves setting different prices for different groups of customers. So, the price may be higher for some customers than for others. But, the price is still at the competitive level for all customers. So, dual pricing does not result in a price higher than the competitive price.\nPredatory pricing involves setting prices low enough to drive other firms out of business. So, the price is higher for other firms than for their own customers. This means that the price is higher than the competitive price for those other firms. So, predatory pricing can result in a price higher than the competitive price for a given industry.\nTransfer pricing involves setting prices for products that are sold across different parts of a company. So, the price may be higher for products that are sold to other parts of the company than for products that are sold to external customers. But, the price is still at the competitive level for external customers. So, transfer pricing does not result in a price higher than the competitive price."}

Some of the terms are:\nopportunity costs: The benefits that a decision-maker gives up.\nSOLUTION: Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. These costs are unchangeable, regardless of the action taken.\nFor example, consider a company that has built a large factory. The company has already incurred the costs of building the factory. These costs are sunk costs.\nThe company cannot recover the sunk costs by not building a factory.\nPrime costs are the costs incurred in the very first stage of a project.\nThese costs can be recovered by the next stage of the project. For example, consider a company that is building a large factory. The costs of the land are the prime costs.\nThe company can recover the land costs by selling the land to a subsequent project.\nIncremental costs are the costs incurred in each stage of a project. These costs can be recovered by the next stage of the project.\nFor example, consider a company that is building a large factory. The costs of building the walls are the incremental costs.\nThe company can recover the wall costs by selling the walls to a subsequent project.\nOpportunity costs are the benefits that a decision-maker gives up.\nThese costs can be recovered by taking a different action.

In the context of finance, linear regression can be used to estimate the relationship between stock returns and market returns.\nStock returns are affected by both the return of the market and the return of the stock itself. This effect is called the alpha. The beta tells you the effect of the market on the stock.\nBoth the alpha and the beta are parameters of the linear regression model. You can use the model to estimate the alpha and the beta.\nThe alpha is the intercept of the regression line. It represents the return of the stock when the market return is zero.\nThe beta is a measure of how much the stock returns change when the market returns change. It is given by the slope of the regression line.\nThe minimizing the stock\u2019s alpha, i.e. its idiosyncratic component, is not the correct answer. This can be seen by noting that the alpha is the intercept of the regression line. It does not have a slope.\nThe alpha of stock returns and their dependence on the market returns is not a linear function of the data. So, the correct answer is not C.\nThe modeling market returns as a function of the stock returns and its beta is the correct answer. This is a linear regression model.

In this case, the auditor's concern is affected by the following factors:\nControl environment factors that affect the organizational structure.\nThe control environment includes the entity's organizational structure, which affects the entity's control environment. An entity with a weak control environment, such as ineffective communication, lack of management oversight, or a lack of commitment to strong internal controls, may have a higher probability of experiencing financial difficulties.\nThe correlation of detection risk and inherent risk.\nDetection risk is the risk that the auditor will not detect a material misstatement in the entity's financial statements. Inherent risk is the risk that the financial statements will contain a material misstatement. If the detection risk is high and the inherent risk is low, the auditor is more likely to have substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe effectiveness of the entity's internal control activities.\nThe effectiveness of the entity's internal control activities may provide evidence about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.

This is because the LIFO method assumes that the last units added to the inventory are the first units sold, while the FIFO method assumes that the first units added to the inventory are the first units sold.\nWhen prices are increasing, the last units added to the inventory are usually older and have a lower cost than the first units added to the inventory. So, under the LIFO method, the ending inventory has a higher cost than it would have using the FIFO method.\nAdditionally, under the LIFO method, the income tax payable is based on the higher cost of the ending inventory. So, income tax payable is lower under the LIFO method than it would be under the FIFO method.\nSOLUTION: Under the LIFO method, the ending inventory has a higher cost than it would have using the FIFO method. So, ending inventory is higher, not lower, than it would have been using the FIFO method.\nAlso, under the LIFO method, income tax payable is based on the higher cost of the ending inventory.

Goodwill reflects the value of the acquired company's brand, customer relationships, and other intangible assets that have some value beyond the manufacturing equipment and other tangible assets.\nGoodwill is an asset, but it is not an identifiable asset. That is,, it is not separate from the other assets of the business. Instead, goodwill is an indirect asset that is included in the overall value of the business.\nThe initial recognition of goodwill is a special case. It is the first time a company recognizes the value of goodwill. The initial recognition of goodwill is an accounting issue.\nGoodwill is initially recognized in the business combination accounting for the purchase of a company. The cost of the purchase includes the amount paid for the business, and the value of the goodwill created. Goodwill is recognized as an asset.\nSubsequent to its initial recognition, goodwill is measured in the same way as other intangible assets. That is, goodwill is measured by comparing the cost of the goodwill to the expected future economic benefits that the goodwill is expected to generate.\nThe fair market value of a company's assets is the amount that the assets could be sold for to a third-party investor. The fair market value of the company's assets is not the same as the book value of the company's assets. The book value of the company's assets is the value that is carried on the company's balance sheet.\nThe book value of the company's assets may be more or less than the fair market value of the company's assets. When the fair market value of the company's assets exceeds the book value of the company's assets, goodwill is created.\nThe creation of goodwill is an economic benefit that the company expects to receive in the future. This economic benefit is an asset.\nSo, the correct answer is B."}

The main effect of a capital project is the change it makes to the assets that are used to generate the government's main revenues. For example, a road project may increase the value of the assets that generate tolls or taxes.\nThe Modified Approach excludes the effects of capital projects on other funds. The main purpose of other funds is to manage resources that are not used to generate principal revenues. The effects of capital projects on other funds are not relevant to the decision-making needs of users of the government's principal revenues.\nWhen a government uses the modified approach, it uses the following two steps to prepare its statement of activities:\nStep 1: Determine what was spent on infrastructure. Infrastructure includes all of the long-lived assets that are not in the governmental funds. These assets may include roads, bridges, and buildings.\nStep 2: Report the expenses in the statement of activities. The expenses in the statement of activities include the expenses in the governmental funds plus the expenses that were not reported in the governmental funds. The expenses that were not reported in the governmental funds include the amounts spent on infrastructure.\nSOLUTION: Under the modified approach, the amounts spent on infrastructure are not reported as expenses in the governmental funds. So, the amounts spent on infrastructure are the only amounts that are not reported as expenses in the governmental funds.\nThe amounts spent on infrastructure are $800,000. The roads have a 20-year useful life, which means that the amounts spent on the roads will be reported as expenses in the statement of activities over 20 years.

The CPA can be held liable under several different legal theories, including strict liability, breach of contract, negligence, and gross negligence.\nA CPA can be held liable for strict liability for damages resulting from an audit. This type of liability does not depend on whether the CPA was negligent. Instead, the CPA can be held liable if it is shown that the audit did not meet the standards of the profession.\nA breach of contract occurs when a CPA does not meet the terms of the contract. The contract may be between the CPA and the client, or it may be between the client and the CPA's firm.\nNegligence is a failure to meet the standard of care.

The useful life of the equipment is not known, and the equipment will be used for future research and development projects.\nThe cost of equipment that will have alternative future uses is a research and development expense. The term \"research and development\" refers to the process of discovering new knowledge, and the application of that knowledge, in the field of technology. The cost of equipment that will have alternative future uses is part of the process of conducting research and development.\nThe proper treatment of the cost of equipment that will have alternative future uses is expensed in the year in which the research and development project started. This is because the equipment is not expected to have a future useful life outside of the research and development project.

Errors can be either overstatements or understatements.\nOverstatement is an error that inflates the value of an account. For example, an overstatement of net income increases the value of net income.\nUnderstatement is an error that deflates the value of an account. For example, an understatement of net income decreases the value of net income.\nErrors can be classified as either material or immaterial. A material error is an error that would have affected a user's decision if that user had known about the error before deciding how to use the information in the accounting records. An immaterial error is an error that is not material.\nInflation is the act of increasing the value of money by increasing the supply of money. One effect of inflation is that it reduces the value of money.\nDuring inflation, each dollar will buy fewer goods and services. For example, if the inflation rate is 2%, a dollar will buy 98 cents' worth of goods and services next year.\nDepression is the opposite of inflation. It is the act of decreasing the value of money by decreasing the supply of money. One effect of depression is that it increases the value of money.\nDuring depression, each dollar will buy more goods and services. For example, if the depression rate is 2%, a dollar will buy 1.02 dollars' worth of goods and services next year.\nSOLUTION: The errors described in the question overstated ending inventory and understated depreciation expense.\nBoth errors are overstatements. An overstatement of ending inventory increases the value of ending inventory, and an understatement of depreciation expense decreases the value of depreciation expense.\nBoth errors had the effect of increasing Mill's pretax income. Therefore, the correct pretax income to report is the pretax income that would have been reported if the errors had not occurred.\nThis can be calculated by adding the amount by which ending inventory was overstated to the amount by which depreciation expense was understated.\n$30000 / $152500 = 0.195\n$64000 / $152500 = 0.420\n0.195 + 0.420 = 0.615\n$152500 + 0.615 = $152500 + $94550 = $246500"}

A professional is held to a certain level of competence, and that competence includes knowledge of the laws and regulations that govern the professional's practice.\nLack of intent is not a defense to a negligence claim. In negligence cases, the plaintiff does not need to prove that the CPA intended to cause harm. It is enough to show that the CPA's actions were careless.\nDue care is a defense to a negligence claim.

The credit period is the number of days that a company gives its customers to pay accounts receivable. The collection efficiency is a measure of how effective a company is at collecting payment after a sale.\nIf a company increases its credit period, it will likely increase its average collection period. This is because it is taking more time to collect payment. But increasing the credit period can also decrease bad debt losses.\nBad debt losses are the result of customers not paying their accounts receivable. By increasing the credit period, a company is allowing more time for customers to pay.

These characteristics include a significant change in the industry or market in which the entity operates, a significant change in the entity's operations, a significant change in the entity's financial results, and the presence of fraud or suspected fraud.\nThe first three characteristics indicate that the entity's financial reports may not be accurately reflecting the entity's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. This increases the risk that material misstatements arising from fraud will go undetected.\nBank reconciliations usually include in-transit deposits. This means that the entity is accurately reporting its cash receipts and is reconciling its cash accounts. So, this characteristic does not heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting.\nEquipment is often sold at a loss before being fully depreciated. This means that the entity may be engaged in aggressive accounting, which can increase the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting.\nEmployees who handle cash receipts are not bonded. This means that the entity may not have adequate controls in place to prevent fraud.

This is called the \"equity method percentage.\"\nThe equity method percentage is determined by using the following formula:\nEquity method percentage = investment in investee / total investment in investee\nThe total investment in the investee is made up of the cost of the investment and any additional amounts paid for the investment since the equity method was first used.\nSOLUTION: Goll's investment in Rose and Jave can be used to influence the investee companies' financial and operating policies. However, Goll does not have the ability to exercise control over either company. So, Goll has significant influence over both investments.\nTo determine which investment Goll should use the equity method for, calculate the equity method percentages for each investment.\nInvestment in Rose: $1,200,000\nInvestment in Jave: $900,000\nTotal investment in Jave: $1,200,000 + $900,000 = $2,100,000\nEquity method percentage for Rose: $1,200,000 / $2,100,000 = 57.1%\nEquity method percentage for Jave: $1,200,000 / $2,100,000 = 57.1%\nBecause both investments give Goll the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee companies, Goll must use the equity method for both investments."}

The parties to the original contract agree to this substitution. Novation discharges the contractual duties of the original party.\nAccord and satisfaction is an agreement by the parties to a contract to consider the contract fulfilled and to stop any further legal proceedings. This agreement results in a discharge of the contractual duties.\nAnticipatory repudiation is when one party to a contract indicates that they will not perform their duties under the contract in the future. This behavior can be considered a discharge of the other party's contractual duties.\nImpossibility of performance means that circumstances outside of the parties' control make it impossible to perform the contract. This circumstance can discharge the contractual duties.\nSOLUTION: Impossibility of performance is the only circumstance that generally will cause a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law.\nAn anticipatory repudiation is a unilateral contract, in which one party indicates that they will not perform their duties under the contract in the future. In a contract, if one party repudiates their duty to perform, the other party may have a claim for damages, but the repudiating party is not discharged from the contract.\nA discharge of the contractual duties is not the only way to escape a contract. A party may be able to escape a contract by demonstrating that they have a legal right to rescind the contract or that the contract was entered into involuntarily.\nHowever, these alternatives do not change the fact that the contract cannot be performed. In other words, they do not discharge the contractual duties."}

Unrecorded liabilities can create a misleading picture of an organization's financial position.\nFor example, imagine an organization that owes money to a vendor but has not yet recorded the liability. By the time the vendor's invoice is received, the fiscal year-end is only a few days away. The vendor's invoice might not be recorded until the next fiscal year, which could create a misleading picture of the organization's financial position at the year-end.\nSOLUTION: An auditor can search for unrecorded liabilities in various ways. One way is to examine the cutoff bank statement for deposits recorded in the books but not by the bank. Banks often make available a bank statement that covers a range of dates, including the cutoff date, which is the end of the fiscal year. This statement will show deposits made to the organization's bank account before the cutoff date.\nIf an organization has incurred liabilities but has not yet recorded them, the cutoff bank statement may show deposits that are actually checks from vendors or employees. These deposits will not be recorded in the organization's accounts, and they will create a misleading picture of the organization's financial position."}

Correcting an error in an earlier financial report affects the reports for all subsequent periods.\nThe effect of correcting an error is to change the amount of depreciation that was reported in the earlier periods. This change increases the amount of depreciation reported in earlier periods. For example, consider an error in the amount of depreciation reported in the prior year. Correcting this error in the current year increases the amount of depreciation reported in the prior year. This increase is added to the accumulated depreciation at the end of the prior year.\nThe effect of correcting an error is a change to the balance in the period of correction. This change affects the reporting of the company's performance in the current period. For example, consider an error in the amount of depreciation reported in the prior year. Correcting this error in the current year increases the accumulated depreciation at the end of the prior year. This change affects the calculation of the company's depreciation expense for the current year.\nSOLUTION: The depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes. So, the error did not affect the tax reporting.\nThe correction of the error in the current year affects the reported depreciation expense for the current year. This increase in depreciation expense is added to the accumulated depreciation at the end of the current year.\nThe correct way to report the correction of the error is as an increase to the accumulated depreciation at the end of the current year.

Compilation involves Assistant: reviewing financial statements and preparing a report that indicates that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards.\nThe report uses language that is defined in the AICPA's Statement of Standards for Accounting and Review Services. For example, the report might say that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe main factors that might lead an accountant not to accept an engagement to compile financial statements are:\nThe financial statements will be used for a purpose that is not appropriate.\nThe financial statements will be provided to parties who will use them for inappropriate purposes.\nThe entity does not follow accounting practices that are acceptable to the accountant.\nThe accountant believes that the financial statements will be materially false or misleading.\nThe presence of indications of financial distress, which might suggest that the entity will be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe entity does not have a segregation of duties in its accounting and payroll departments.\nThe entity does not investigate reports of asset misappropriation.\nThe entity will omit substantially all of the disclosures required by GAAP from its financial statements.\nThe financial statements will be included in a written personal financial plan.\nSOLUTION: GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) are the guidelines for preparing financial statements. They are called \"generally accepted\" because they are used by many entities in the United States.\nIf an entity omits substantially all of the disclosures required by GAAP from its financial statements, the financial statements will not follow GAAP. So, if an accountant knows that an engagement to compile financial statements will include financial statements that do not follow GAAP, the accountant may not accept the engagement.\nThe other factors should not affect an accountant's decision to accept or not accept an engagement to compile financial statements."}

The higher the IRR, the more attractive the project.\nThe IRR can't be less than the cost of capital. This means that if the IRR is positive, the project will create value.\nBut the IRR does not take the time value of money into account. This means that the IRR may change if the market rate of return changes.\nBecause the IRR does not take the time value of money into account, it may not rank projects the same way that NPV does. For example, consider two projects with the same IRR. If the NPV of each project is different, then the projects must have different lengths of time until they recoup their costs. But the IRR does not take this into account.\nThere is a relationship between the IRR and the NPV. If the IRR is greater than the cost of capital, then the NPV is positive. But the IRR may not be the same as the NPV.\nYou should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison. If you use multiple metrics, different investors might rank projects differently."}

This is because the building will be a long-term asset for the company.\nCapitalizing building costs involves adding the costs to the balance sheet as the cost of a new asset. Over time, the company can use the asset to generate revenue. For example, a factory can generate sales.\nThe cost of the building is recorded as the initial cost of the asset. This cost includes all the costs necessary to get the asset ready to be used. These costs can include things like the purchase price, architect's fees, and legal fees.\nThe asset is then depreciated, or reduced, over time. Depreciation is an accounting method that allocates the initial cost of an asset to the years the asset is expected to be used. This means that each year, a portion of the cost of the building is recorded as an expense.\nThe land is not normally capitalized as part of the building cost. However, in some cases, the cost of land can be capitalized as part of the building cost. This is because the land and the building are being produced as a single product.\nSOLUTION: To capitalize the cost of the factory building, include the costs of the building, title insurance, and legal fees to purchase the land. Do not include the cost of razing the old building or the architect's fees.\nThe total cost to capitalize is $1,975,000."}

The accrual basis of accounting records transactions when they are incurred, regardless of when cash is paid or received.\nThe accounting for insurance expense changed from the cash basis to the accrual basis in the current year. This means that Bailey is now recognizing insurance expense when it is incurred, rather than when it is paid.\nBecause insurance expense is being recognized on the accrual basis, Bailey should record the insurance transaction as a debit to insurance expense.\nThe purchase of a four-year insurance policy is a fixed asset. Fixed assets do not get expensed. They get depreciated. So, Bailey should not record the purchase of the insurance policy as a debit to prepaid insurance.\nThe purchase of a four-year insurance policy is also not an expense. Expenses are items that are expired at the end of the accounting period. The purchase of a four-year insurance policy is a long-term asset. So, Bailey should not record the purchase of the insurance policy as a debit to prepaid insurance or a debit to insurance expense.\nInstead, Bailey should record the purchase of the insurance policy as a debit to an asset account such as prepaid insurance or as a credit to an equity account such as retained earnings.\nSOLUTION: The key to accounting for the purchase of a four-year insurance policy is to identify the proper account. The purchase of the insurance policy is a long-term asset. So, Bailey should record the purchase of the insurance policy as a debit to an asset account such as prepaid insurance or as a credit to an equity account such as retained earnings.\nThe question tells you that Bailey changed to the accrual basis of accounting for insurance expense.

Internal controls are designed to help an entity achieve its objectives. In order to do this, internal controls need to be able to prevent or detect errors, fraud, or other irregularities.\nAn inherent limitation is a fundamental constraint that makes it impossible for an internal control to achieve its objective. In other words, an inherent limitation is a built-in weakness that cannot be eliminated.\nAn entity's audit committee can be an inherent limitation to the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. This is because audit committees are made up of individuals who may have conflicting interests. For example, an audit committee member who is also an officer of the entity may be less likely to question management's decisions.\nCollusion of employees in circumventing internal controls is an example of an inherent limitation. This is because employees who collude may be able to bypass internal controls that would normally prevent errors or fraud.\nThe complexity of the entity's electronic order processing system is not an inherent limitation. This is because an electronic order processing system can be designed and implemented in such a way as to avoid complexity.\nThe lack of resources to monitor internal controls is not an inherent limitation. This is because the lack of resources can be addressed by management. For example, management could reallocate resources or make different choices about which activities to prioritize."}

The prevailing price can change over time, depending on interest rates and other market conditions.\nIf you sell a bond before it matures, you may get back more or less than the face value of the bond. The holding period return is the return on your investment over the time you held the bond.\nTo calculate the holding period return, use the following formula:\nHolding period return = [(Purchase price + Coupons) - Sales price] / Purchase price\nSOLUTION: The bond was bought at a price of 104.1. This means that you paid $104.1 for the bond.\nThe bond pays coupons of 8% of the face value, or $8 per year. There are 5 years in the bond's life.\nAt the end of the third year, the bond's prevailing price is 82. This means that you can sell the bond for $82.\nTo calculate the holding period return, use the formula above.\nThe gain from the coupons is $8 \u00d7 3 = $24. The loss from the sale of the bond is $104.1 - $82 = $22.1. The holding period return is 24%."}

This rate is set based on the precision of the sample and the allowance for sampling risk.\nIf the sample results show that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate, it means that the actual rate of deviation is likely to be higher than the tolerable rate. So, the auditor is justified in reducing the planned reliance on the prescribed control.\nThe prescribed control is the control that is prescribed for that control objective. A control is a process, policy, or procedure that is designed to help ensure that an organization's objectives are achieved. Substantive tests are tests that are designed to detect material errors or fraud.\nThe assistant auditor may reduce the planned reliance on the prescribed control because the sample results indicate that the prescribed control may not be effective. This reduction may result in an increase in the planned reliance on substantive tests.\nThe assistant auditor may also reduce the assistant auditor's assessment of the control risk.

The standard deviation of a portfolio is a measure of the risk of the portfolio. This measure is used because the return on a portfolio is not a single number, but a range of possible returns.\nFor example, consider an investment in a portfolio that is made up of two investments, A and B. The standard deviation of the portfolio is 8.70%. This means that the return on the portfolio is expected to range between -16.79% and +41.79% over a one-year period.\nThe standard deviation can be used to describe the potential gain or loss of an investment in the portfolio. An investor can use the standard deviation to determine how much the investment is likely to gain or lose relative to the return on the portfolio.\nFor example, if the return on the portfolio is 25%, the investment in the portfolio is likely to gain 20% to 30%. If the return on the portfolio is 5%, the investment in the portfolio is likely to gain 4% to 16%.\nSOLUTION: The standard deviation of a portfolio is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences of the returns on the portfolio from their expected return.\nThe expected return on a portfolio is a weighted average of the returns on the investments in the portfolio. The weights are the percentages of the portfolio that is invested in each investment.\nFor example, consider an investment in a portfolio that is made up of two investments, A and B. The expected return on the portfolio is calculated as follows:\nExpected return on the portfolio = wA \\* Return on A + wB \\* Return on B\nWhere wA and wB are the weights of A and B in the portfolio.\nFor this portfolio, the weights are 0.25 and 0.75.\nSo, the expected return on the portfolio is:\nExpected return on the portfolio = 0.25 \\* Return on A + 0.75 \\* Return on B\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio is the square root of the sum of the squared differences of the returns on the portfolio from its expected return.\nFor this portfolio, the standard deviation is calculated as follows:\nStandard deviation of the portfolio = 8.70%"}

It is closest to the yield on a taxable bond when the maturities and the face values of the taxable bond and the tax-free Treasury bill are equal.\nThe BEY is based on the fact that a tax-free Treasury bill is equal in value to a taxable bond with the same maturity and face value. The BEY is the yield on the taxable bond.\nTo calculate the BEY, use the following formula:\nBEY = (1 - (1 / (1 + yield))^((13-1)/4)) * 100\nThe yield on a $1,000, 13-week Treasury bill purchased for $960 can be calculated using the BEY formula.\nFirst, calculate the number of weeks from the purchase date to the 13-week maturity date:\n13 weeks = 3.75 months\n13-week T-bill purchased 3.75 months ago = 13-week T-bill purchased 3 months ago\n3 months = 13 weeks / 52 weeks\n3 months = 0.25 years\n13-week T-bill purchased 3 months ago = T-bill with a maturity of 0.25 years\nThe yield on a 0.25-year T-bill with a face value of $1,000 is 16.7%:\n16.7% = (1 - (1 / (1 + 0.167))^((0.25/4)/4)) * 100\nThen, add the 1.5% purchase premium to the yield:\n17.0% = (1.167) + (1.5% / 1.167)\n17.0% is the yield on a $1,000, 13-week US Treasury bill purchased for $960."}

Two types of changes in accounting estimates are changes in accounting principles and changes in estimates.\nChanges in accounting principles are changes in the methods for preparing financial statements. They are normally made when an accounting principle is updated, superseded, or when the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issues a new principle.\nChanges in estimates are changes in the assumptions that were used to prepare the previous financial statements. Changes in estimates can be made when new information becomes available, or when the financial statements are audited.\nWhen a change in an estimate is made, it is considered a change in accounting estimate. It is not considered a change in accounting principle.\nWhen it is impossible to determine whether a change in an estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be considered a change in principle.\nThis means that if it is impossible to determine whether a change in an estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be accounted for retrospectively.\nThis is the opposite of what the question tells you is the correct accounting treatment. So, the statement is incorrect.\nWhenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in accounting estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be considered a change in estimate.\nThis means that if it is impossible to determine whether a change in an estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be accounted for prospectively.\nThis is the opposite of what the question tells you is the correct accounting treatment. So, the statement is incorrect.\nIt is easier to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a change in accounting principle than it is to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a correction of an error.\nThis means that it is easier to decide whether a change is a change in an estimate or a change in a principle than it is to decide whether a change is a correction of an error."}

Current Net ratio income", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increases Increases"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increases Decreases"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Decreases Increases"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decreases Decreases"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A variances is an measure of how much a particular cost account has deviated from its standard. Variances can be favorable or unfavorable.\nWhen a variance is unfavorable, it means that the actual cost was higher than the standard cost. To help offset the higher costs, variances can be written off, or charged, to cost of goods sold. This has the effect of reducing the net income for the period.\nIf a variance is allocated to a product, it is charged to the product's cost. This increases the cost of the product. When the product is sold, the cost of goods sold is increased, which has the effect of reducing net income.\nIf a variance is allocated to work in process or finished goods, it is charged to the inventory. This increases the cost of the inventory. When the inventory is sold, the cost of goods sold is increased, which has the effect of reducing net income.\nAllocating a variance to cost of goods sold or to inventory has the same effect on net income. The difference is that allocating a variance to cost of goods sold reduces the current ratio, while allocating a variance to inventory has no effect on the current ratio.\nSOLUTION: Writing off unfavorable variances directly to cost of goods sold has the effect of decreasing both the current ratio and net income.\nAllocating unfavorable variances to work in process and finished goods decreases net income but has no effect on the current ratio. Allocating unfavorable variances to cost of goods sold decreases both the current ratio and net income."}
