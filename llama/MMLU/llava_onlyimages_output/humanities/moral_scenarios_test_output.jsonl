For example, taking money from an open, unattended bag is generally seen as wrong.\nSOLUTION: According to ordinary moral standards in the United States, it is not wrong to hand your brother the toothbrush so he can clean his teeth. Neither is it wrong to build a man cave in your midlife crisis."}

So, when you are faced with a decision, you are, in a sense, trying to figure out what the best way is to get the outcome you want.\nTo help you make this decision, you can use criteria. A criterion is a standard that you use to evaluate alternative ways of acting. Criteria can include any information that you think is relevant to your decision.\nSome criteria are:\nWhat are your goals?\nWhat are your values?\nWhat are the risks and benefits of different actions?\nWhat are the costs and benefits of different actions?\nWhat are the possible outcomes of each action?\nWhat are the chances that each outcome will occur?\nYou can use criteria to decide how to act. For example, if you want to decide which college to attend, you might use criteria such as the reputation of the college, the cost of attending the college, and the programs offered.\nSOLUTION: When you are deciding how to act, you are using criteria to determine what to do. So, when you evaluate a scenario, you are evaluating it based on how well it meets your criteria.\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, smoking is morally wrong. So, the fact that the main character lit up a cigarette is clearly morally wrong.\nThe fact that the main character ran away from their family is not clearly morally wrong. It is not wrong for a person to choose to leave a difficult situation."}

One choice you can make is whether to use the word \"I\" to write about yourself. Using \"I\" to write about yourself is called first-person point of view.\nOther choices you can make include choosing what to include in your story and where to start your story. Each of these choices can affect how your writing is received.\nImagine that you are writing a profile for a dating site and you want to include a picture of yourself. Which picture do you choose?\nYou could choose a picture from a night out with friends. Or, you could choose a picture from a day at the beach. Both pictures might show you having fun. But, the night out with friends picture might not be the best choice. It might send the message that you are more interested in partying than in a serious relationship.\nThe picture from a day at the beach could send a different message. It might suggest that you are laid-back and enjoy spending time outdoors.\nWays to use first-person point of view:\nFirst-person point of view can make your writing more personal. It can also make your writing more persuasive.\nWhen you write in first-person point of view, you are one person telling a story. This can make your writing relatable and compelling.\nFirst-person point of view can also be used to show, not tell, what a character is like. For example, instead of telling your readers that your characters are honest, you can show them. For example, you can have your characters admit that they broke a promise.\nFirst-person point of view can also be used to create a sense of curiosity. For example, you can write, \"I wonder what would happen if I put this chemical in that acid?\""}

One such distinction is between acts and omissions. An act is something you do. An omission is something you fail to do.\nBoth acts and omissions can be moral or immoral. But the moral judgment is often different. Omissions are often judged more harshly than acts.\nWhy is that? One reason is that omissions can have bigger consequences than acts. For example, if you fail to give a person a life-saving medicine, that omission might result in the person's death. In contrast, if you give the person a different medicine, the worst that can usually happen is that the person's condition won't improve.\nAnother reason is that omissions can be a sign of disregard for others. If you fail to help someone who is in trouble, it might be a sign that you are selfish or uncaring.\nImagine a lifeguard who sees a drowning person. The lifeguard is responsible for saving people who are in trouble. If the lifeguard fails to save the drowning person, that omission might result in the person's death. So, the lifeguard does a clearly morally wrong thing by omitting to save the drowning person.\nNow consider the two scenarios. In Scenario 1, the main character lets her husband sleep. The main character did not plan to do this. She discovered the bedroom was on fire and then decided to let her husband sleep.

One way to write is to use first-person point of view. The writer uses \"I\" to tell the story.\nFirst-person point of view can make your writing more personal and engaging.

So, in first-person point of view, the writer can't say that the main character in the story does something clearly morally wrong. The writer can only say that the writer did something.\nImagine a scenario where a character knows that his or her friend is going to cheat on a test. The writer can't say, \"My friend knew that I was going to cheat on the test.\" The writer can only say, \"I knew that I was going to cheat on the test.\"\nSOLUTION: In Scenario 1, the writer uses first-person point of view.
