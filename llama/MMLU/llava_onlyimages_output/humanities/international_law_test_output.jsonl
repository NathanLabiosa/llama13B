The use of force is the essential element in humanitarian intervention.\nResponsibility to Protect (R2P) is a concept that builds on the idea of humanitarian intervention. It expands the types of actions that can be taken to include non-forcible measures such as diplomacy and development aid. The central idea of R2P is that sovereign states have a responsibility to protect their citizens from four crimes: war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing. The international community has a responsibility to assist states in fulfilling this responsibility. The use of force is a last resort after all other non-violent means have been exhausted."}

These intentions, objectives, and purposes are found in the preparatory work for the treaty, such as diplomatic correspondence, and the circumstances in which the treaty was concluded.\nThe ordinary meaning of the treaty's terms is one factor to be considered. The ordinary meaning is what the terms would mean to a typical reader. This meaning can be determined by looking at the words in the treaty and how they would be understood by a person familiar with the subject matter.\nThe object and purpose of a treaty is one of the factors to be considered. The object and purpose of a treaty are found in its preamble and body. The object and purpose can also be found by looking at the circumstances in which the treaty was concluded.\nTreaties are to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. This is the correct approach to interpreting a treaty. This approach recognizes that a treaty is a legally binding document and must be interpreted in good faith. It also recognizes that a treaty's terms must be given a meaning that is appropriate in the context of the treaty and in light of its object and purpose."}

It does not say that port states do not enforce their jurisdiction in any circumstance. It says they do not enforce their jurisdiction in cases that do not infringe their customs laws or disrupt peace and public order."}

Like many legal systems, international law has a hierarchy of sources.\nThe hierarchy of sources means that some sources are more important than others. When there is a conflict between sources, the higher-ranked source prevails.\nThe formal sources of international law are the following:\n1. Treaties: International treaties are agreements between countries. They are enforceable under international law.\n2. Custom: Custom is the practice of countries that is widely accepted as binding. Over time, custom can become part of the international legal system.\n3. General Principles of Law: General principles of law are legal principles that are widely accepted by countries. These principles can include ideas from national legal systems as well as international law.\n4. Judicial decisions: Judicial decisions are the rulings that international courts make in cases brought before them. These rulings can help to interpret and apply the other sources of international law.\nSOLUTION: The hierarchy of sources is:\ntreaties supersede (take precedence over) custom\ncustom supersedes general principles of law\nand treaties supersede general principles of law.\nSo, there is a hierarchy between the formal sources of international law."}

It says that \"nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs.\"\nA collective defense action under Article 51 is based on the right of self-defense. As such, it is broader than a resolution authorizing the use of force. A collective defense action can be taken in response to any armed attack.\nIn contrast, UNSC Resolution 678 was narrower than the inherent right of self-defense under Article 51.

The answer is C. Sovereignty means freedom to determine one's own affairs without external interference. This is the defining characteristic of a sovereign State.\nA sovereign State has the right to make its own laws and to control its own affairs. This includes the right to defend itself. But the ability to defend itself is not what defines a sovereign State.\nBeing recognized by other States and being able to enter into treaties and join the UN are benefits of sovereignty, but they are not what defines a sovereign State.\nPossessing the right to defend oneself is a part of sovereignty, but it is not the whole of it."}

In the context of international law, recognition is the voluntary act of one State in treating another State as a State.\nFunctional recognition is a type of recognition. It is recognition of a declared statehood. In other words, it is recognition of the fact that a government considers itself to be a State.\nFunctional recognition is different from recognition of a government. A government is a group of people who have assumed the responsibility of providing governance in a State. Recognition is only afforded to a government, not to the State.\nFunctional recognition is also different from recognition of an entity's statehood. An entity's statehood is a declaration of fact. Recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts and not to the entity's declared statehood.\nFinally, recognition is reciprocal between two states. If State A recognizes State B, then State B recognizes State A. Recognition is a two-way street."}

Like all systems, the international society has a structure. This structure defines how the parts of the international society are organized and how they relate to each other.\nThe vertical model of the domestic legal orders is a model for the structure of the international society. Under this model, the international society has a hierarchy of superior and subordinate entities. At the top of the hierarchy is the international organization with the most comprehensive power. Below this organization are other international organizations, and at the bottom are the states.\nThe horizontal model of the domestic legal orders is another model for the structure of the international society. Under this model, states and other international organizations are equals. There is no hierarchy of superior and subordinate entities. Instead, states and other international organizations cooperate with each other on a more or less equal footing.\nAn anarchic society is a society that has no government. In an anarchic society, there is no central authority to resolve disputes and enforce the rules. So, in an anarchic society, the rules are not always followed, and disputes can escalate into violence.\nThe structure of the international society resembles the structure of the most powerful nations in the world. This means that the international society has a hierarchy of states, with some states being more powerful than others."}

The common law theory of incorporation is based on the reception of customary law by the common law court. This reception requires an act of the legislature to give the court the power to receive customary law. This power, once given, can be exercised by the court on an ad hoc basis. [...] Without legislation, the court has no power to receive customary law. [...]\"\nThis means that there are limitations to the incorporation of customary crimes under English law. An act of parliament is required before customary law can be incorporated into the domestic sphere. Before that, the common law court does not have the power to receive customary law."}

These include: when the applicant is in the custody of the state, to investigate claims against the state, and to ensure legal certainty and predictability. The development of a legal framework to protect those within the state and to provide housing for all those homeless within a state have not been developed by the European Court of Human Rights as situations where the state has a positive obligation to protect."}

The ICCPR includes a mechanism for enforcing its provisions.\nThe first step in enforcing the ICCPR is the reporting mechanism. The ICCPR requires states parties to report to the United Nations how they are implementing the treaty. This reporting involves detailed descriptions of domestic laws and practices.\nThe ICCPR also provides for the possibility of individuals seeking communications with the Committee. This right to individual petition is a key enforcement mechanism. Individuals may make written submissions to the Committee, raising their concerns about alleged violations of the ICCPR by their governments.\nJudgment of an international tribunal is not an enforcement mechanism for the ICCPR. The ICCPR does not provide for a tribunal to hear and decide cases against states parties."}

Lis pendens is a rule of civil procedure that is applied in some domestic legal systems. It means that the court that hears a case first is the court that has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate it.\nThere is no hierarchy among international courts and tribunals. In other words, there is no order of precedence or superiority among them.\nThe International Court of Justice has by definition priority over any other court or tribunal. This means that the ICJ has the highest priority, or highest jurisdictional authority, among all international courts and tribunals. But this does not mean that the ICJ has the power to order other courts or tribunals to stop proceedings.\nRegional or special courts have priority over all others in line of the principle of lex specialis. This means that, when a case can be heard by both a regional or special court and a national court, the former should be chosen in preference to the latter. This is because the regional or special court is better equipped to deal with the case."}

An express authorization is given directly by the head of a state to a soldier to use force. A soldier does not have to look beyond the express authorization to determine the scope of her power.\nAn implied authorization is found in the circumstances. The scope of the implied authorization is limited by the facts and circumstances in which the soldier acts. A soldier can use force only to make good a threat or to rectify a situation.\nThe five criteria for implied authorization are:\n1. A threat must have been made.\n2. The threat must be against a person or a state.\n3. The threat must be of an attack.\n4. The attack must be justified as self-defense.\n5. The action must be proportional to the threat.\nThe first three criteria are the same as the criteria for a soldier to have the use of force in self-defense. The fourth criterion is the same as the criterion for a state to use force in self defense. The fifth criterion is the same as the criterion for the use of force to be proportional.\nA state may presume that it has the authority to use armed force if it has been forewarned of an armed attack by another state. But this is a presumption. The state may still have to demonstrate that the actual use of armed force was authorized by the U.N. Security Council.\nThe U.N. Security Council may authorize armed force by a specific number of votes. But this is a explicit authorization. It is not an implied authorization.\nThe U.N. Security Council may authorize armed force to maintain international peace and security. But this is a explicit authorization. It is not an implied authorization.\nThe U.N. Security Council may authorize a state to use armed force to rectify a situation. But this is a explicit authorization. It is not an implied authorization."}

This concept was first proposed by the British in 1933 and was the basis for the League of Nations.\nUnder collective security, states agree to come to the aid of an attacked ally. This means that an attack on one state is considered an attack on all states in the alliance. The right to self-defense by more than one nation acting in concert is another way of saying collective security."}

{"question": "Is the jurisdiction of international tribunals regulated by the same principles applicable to national courts?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts are also common to international tribunals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The jurisdiction of all international tribunals is regulated by the UN Security Council"}, {"label": "C", "text": "International tribunals share some, but not all, of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The jurisdiction of international tribunals is dictated solely by their founding treaties"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The jurisdiction of national courts and international tribunals is different in some ways, but the same in others.\nNational courts have jurisdiction over the actions of their own government and the actions of private individuals within their territory. The jurisdictional principles that apply to national courts are based on the territorial sovereignty of states, which means that courts in a state have jurisdiction over matters that occur within that state's territory.\nInternational tribunals have jurisdiction over disputes that arise from the violation of international law. The jurisdictional principles that apply to international tribunals are based on the consent of the states involved.\nSome of the principles that apply to national courts also apply to international tribunals. For example, the principle of territoriality applies to both national courts and international tribunals. This means that national courts have jurisdiction over matters that occur within their territory, and international tribunals have jurisdiction over disputes that arise from the violation of international law within the territory of one of the states involved in the dispute.\nThe UN Security Council has the authority to establish international tribunals. But the jurisdictional principles that apply to these tribunals are not the same as the principles that apply to national courts. The jurisdiction of international tribunals established by the Security Council is regulated by the Security Council and not by the principles applicable to national courts.\nThe jurisdiction of international tribunals is not dictated solely by their founding treaties. The founding treaties of international tribunals set out the tribunals' jurisdiction, but the principles that apply to these tribunals are based on the consent of the states involved."}

They exercise their powers within the limits of their authority.\nDE FACTO ORGANS: These are the individuals or entities that are not part of the government, but who are acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the state. They exercise elements of governmental authority.\nThe term de facto is Latin for \"in fact\" or \"actually existing.\"\nDe facto organs are not part of the formal government, but they are treated as actors in the international community.

Customs are often specific to a particular area, and over time, they can become a recognized part of the law. To become part of the law, a custom must be created, recognized, and applied in a specific way.\nCreation: A custom is created when a group of people in a particular area agree to do something. For a custom to be created, a group of people must have the intent to create a custom.\nRecognition: Once a custom is created, it must be recognized by the courts. The courts will look at the specific facts and circumstances around the creation of the custom to determine whether the custom is recognized.\nApplication: After a custom is created and recognized, it must be applied in a specific way. The custom must become a part of the law by being applied in courts.\nIf a custom is not in conflict with existing legislation, it is incorporated into the law. In other words, a custom is a source of law only if it is not in conflict with a statute.\nStatutory law (law made by Parliament) can also create customs. When a statute tells people to do something, they are creating a custom.\nSOLUTION: Under English law, a custom is incorporated into the law if it is not in conflict with existing legislation."}

{"question": "What was the consequence from the absence of implementing legislation in the Tin Council case?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The International Tin Council was headquartered in London and hence the absence of implementing legislation was inconsequential"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The constitutive treaties of international organisations are subject to the doctrine of incorporation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The absence of implementing legislation with respect to the Council's founding treaty meant that individuals did not derive rights and duties from it in the English legal system"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The absence of implementing legislation in England in respect of an international organisation is inconsequential under international law"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Under traditional international law, the absence of implementing legislation in a host country was inconsequential in respect of an international organization. The main reason for this was that, in the absence of an international legal system with a central government, the organization's ability to make and enforce rules was limited by the extent to which its members were willing to adhere to its rules. In this situation, the organization could act only as a private organization and could not act as a sovereign.\nHowever, the Tin Council case changed this. In this case, the Court of Appeal held that the absence of implementing legislation in England in respect of the International Tin Council was inconsequential under international law. The court reached this conclusion on the ground that the doctrine of incorporation did not apply to the Council's constitutive treaty.\nThe doctrine of incorporation is a principle of English law under which a treaty becomes a part of the law of the land. This means that, under English law, an individual can derive rights and duties from a treaty even in the absence of implementing legislation. The doctrine of incorporation applies to treaties that are made with foreign sovereigns and to treaties that relate to matters that are within the scope of the domestic legal system.\nThe Council's constitutive treaty did not relate to matters that are within the scope of the domestic legal system. Consequently, the doctrine of incorporation did not apply to the treaty. This meant that the treaty did not become a part of the law of the land under English law. Therefore, the absence of implementing legislation in England in respect of the Council's founding treaty meant that individuals did not derive rights and duties from it in the English legal system."}

This means that when a State performs a unilateral act, it does not automatically change the legal rights or obligations of any other State.\nUnilateral acts can include a wide range of political acts. For example, a State may make a public statement, issue a declaration, or take other actions that do not have a specific legal effect.\nUnilateral acts can also include some administrative measures. An administrative measure is an act that is done by a State's administrative arm, as opposed to its diplomatic or military arms. Examples of administrative measures include the issuance of a license or the making of a payment.\nUnilateral acts can also include some treaty provisions. A treaty is a type of international agreement. When States enter into a treaty, they make commitments to each other. Some provisions of a treaty may be unilateral, meaning that they bind one State but not the other States that are parties to the treaty."}

This practice is controversial, and different countries have different positions on it. But, in England and Wales, such abduction is unlawful. It is also a ground for refusal of jurisdiction under the forum non conveniens doctrine.\nThe courts may stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction. But, the courts will seldom do so because it would prevent the administration of justice in respect of international criminals. Such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings."}

When a treaty is incorporated into the Constitution, it becomes the supreme law of the land.\nA treaty that has become the supreme law of the land as a result of the doctrine of incorporation is superior to a conflicting federal or state law. This means that, if a treaty and a law conflict, the treaty will control.\nSo, the doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law."}

The legal methods include adjudication and arbitration, and the political methods include diplomacy.\nThe outcome arising from legal methods, ie arbitration or adjudication by the ICJ, is final and binding upon the parties, whereas this is not the case with diplomatic methods.\nThe political methods are pursued upon the consent of the parties to the dispute, whereas the legal methods not.\nThe legal methods of dispute settlement are pursued only in respect of significant disputes, whereas the political means are employed in all disputes."}

This rule aims to restrict the volume of petitions to international tribunals while at the same time building up the capacity of local courts.\nThe local remedies rule has three main objectives: to encourage countries to improve their domestic human rights institutions, to reduce the workload of international human rights tribunals, and to provide an opportunity for domestic remedies to be pursued."}

Instead, it dealt with the immunity of a former head of state.\nThe House of Lords held that former heads of state are not immune from legal process under customary international law. This means that a former head of state can be prosecuted for acts he committed while in office.\nThe House of Lords also held that common law principles do not afford personal immunity to former heads of state for acts committed before they left office. This means that a former head of state is not immune from legal process under domestic law for acts he committed while in office."}

The question is where to find these general principles of law.\nThe first sentence of article 38 says that the Court may look to principles recognized among \"the most civilized nations.\" This has been interpreted to mean principles recognized by a subset of civilized nations.\nThe second sentence of article 38 provides a clearer answer: the Court may apply general principles of international law. These principles are derived from the practice of states and from international instruments, including treaties.\nOther international courts and tribunals have applied, and in some cases developed, these general principles of international law."}

Every other act of violence on the high seas is a criminal act.\nA warship is not a pirate ship, but an illegal act of violence on a warship is an act of piracy.\nActs of piracy do not have to be committed against another vessel. An act of piracy can be committed against a vessel or any other type of property.\nAn act of piracy is committed for private ends when the act is intended to secure money or any other form of property.\nAn act of piracy is committed on the high seas when it takes place beyond the territory of any State and outside the territorial sea of any State.\nThe territorial sea of a State is a area of water extending up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline of a State."}

But we know that Article 51 allows states to act in self-defense following an \"armed attack.\"\nSome courts and scholars have interpreted the term \"armed attack\" to include all types of armed force. Other courts and scholars interpret the term more narrowly to include only certain types of armed force, such as military attacks by states.\nStill, others interpret the term to include terrorist attacks.\nTerrorist attacks may be a form of armed attack. But whether they are considered an armed attack under Article 51 is a question of interpretation.\nSome states and scholars argue that terrorist attacks are included in the term \"armed attack.\" They point out that the UN Charter condemns terrorism and that states have a right to self-defense against terrorist attacks.\nOther states and scholars argue that terrorist attacks are not included in the term \"armed attack.\" They point out that the term \"armed attack\" is not defined in the UN Charter and that the Charter does not explicitly mention terrorist attacks."}

The law of international responsibility deals with the consequences of internationally wrongful conduct. An \"injured state\" is a state that has been injured as a result of such conduct.\nAn internationally wrongful conduct can cause a state to suffer a damage. So, a state is injured in case that it has suffered a damage from the internationally wrongful conduct.\nA violation of a peremptory norm of international law can also cause a state to suffer a damage. So, a state is injured in case that there has been a violation of a peremptory norm of international law.\nA state can also be injured by internationally wrongful conduct that is aimed at it. So, a state is injured should it acknowledge the existence of the internationally wrongful conduct.\nAn obligation breached was owed to a state individually, or it was owed to a group of states, including that state, and that state was specially affected. So, a state is injured if the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of states, including that state, and it was specially affected."}

Under UNCLOS, the coastal State enjoys ipso facto and ab initio sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.\nSovereign rights are a type of property right. In general, a property right gives the owner the exclusive right to use, control, or dispose of a specific property. Sovereign rights over a continental shelf give the coastal State the exclusive right to explore the shelf and to exploit its natural resources.\nThe coastal State may exercise its sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources. It may also license or permit other parties to exercise these rights.\nThe coastal State may exercise sovereign rights over its continental shelf only upon its declaration. This means that the coastal State may not exercise its sovereign rights until it has notified the international community of its intent to do so.\nThe coastal State may exercise only limited rights over its continental shelf and only upon the consent of its neighboring States. This means that the coastal State may not exercise all of its sovereign rights over its continental shelf without the consent of its neighboring States."}

Jus cogens norms are the most fundamental norms of international law, and any conflict between a treaty and a jus cogens norm would result in the norm prevailing over the treaty.\nSecond, article 103 cannot trump multilateral treaties. A multilateral treaty is a treaty between multiple states. If a treaty is in conflict with a multilateral treaty, the multilateral treaty generally prevails.\nThird, article 103 may not be applicable when a case is submitted to the ICJ. When a case is submitted to the ICJ, the court becomes the highest authority on the matter. Any provision of the Charter that conflicts with the court's judgment would cease to have effect."}

This means that implied powers are not explicitly stated in the organization's charter, but are necessary to achieve the goals and purposes set forth in the charter.\nFor example, the charter of a environmental organization may state that the organization will conduct research and disseminate information. To carry out these tasks, the organization may need to publish research findings in scientific journals. This power is not explicitly stated in the charter, but it is necessary to achieve the organization's goals. So, the power to publish research findings in scientific journals is an implied power."}
