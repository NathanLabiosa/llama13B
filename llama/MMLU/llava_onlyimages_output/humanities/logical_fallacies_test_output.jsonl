For example, an argument that begins with conclusions and does not include any reasons is missing a premise. An argument that includes inconclusive or irrelevant premises is also missing important parts.\nSOLUTION: A deductively valid argument is a special kind of argument that is both logically and semantically valid.

If a source is genuinely flawed, then it should be dismissed on its own merits. But the fact that a source is flawed does not mean that its evidence is unreliable.\nThe fallacy of appeal to common practice is a type of fallacy. This type of fallacy happens when someone argues that an act or series of acts should be carried out because they have been carried out in the past. This line of reasoning is not always fallacious. After all, it is often a good idea to do what has been done in the past. But it is a fallacy to assume that an act or series of acts should always be done only because they have been done in the past.\nDrawing a conclusion after purposely leaving out evidence or ignoring known evidence is a type of fallacy. This type of fallacy is sometimes called the \"fallacy of inattention.\" It can also happen when someone draws a conclusion based on a sample that is not representative of the population.\nThe fallacy of appeal to nature is a type of fallacy.

To accomplish this purpose, arguments can use evidence and logic.\nEvading the issue is a type of reasoning that is used to avoid dealing with an issue. Instead of making an argument for a conclusion, evading the issue involves bringing up a topic that is not relevant to the issue at hand.\nThere are many ways that people can evaded the issue. One way is to use a \"you too\" fallacy. A \"you too\" fallacy works by pointing out that the audience has flaws or faults. The idea is to distract the audience by getting them to focus on their own flaws.\nIrrelevant conclusions are another way to evade the issue. An irrelevant conclusion is a conclusion that is not supported by the claims made in the argument. When an argument contains an irrelevant conclusion, it can make the audience wonder why the argument was made in the first place.\nAppeals to fear can also be a way to evade the issue. An appeal to fear is a type of argument that uses scare tactics to get the audience to do something. But, the conclusion of an appeal to fear does not have to be true.\nFinally, arguments that are directed at the person making the argument, rather than the issue at hand, can also be a way to evade the issue.

For example, taking a multivitamin and getting more sleep might be causally related, but they are not correlated.\nIt is possible for an event to be both correlated and causally related to other events. For example, the number of hours of sleep you get each night is correlated with your weight, and getting more sleep can cause you to weigh more.\nIt is also possible for an event to be neither correlated nor causally related to other events. For example, the price of a stock is not correlated with the taste of a daffodil.\n\nSOLUTION: The 0.0 grade reported by the student is a mistake. The student argues that if the class was as good as Professor Jones said, none of the students deserved to fail. This argument is based on the assumption that being a good class and getting a high grade are the same thing. They are not.\nBeing a good class and getting a high grade are not the same thing.\nA class can be good because the students are well-behaved and hardworking. But being a good class does not necessarily mean that the students will get high grades.\nHigh grades reflect how well the students are doing in the class. But being a good class does not necessarily mean that the students are doing well in the class.\nSo, it is possible for a good class to have some students fail."}

They can make an argument sound persuasive, but they do not make the argument necessarily true.\nOne way to commit a fallacy is to use equivocation.\nEquivocation is a fallacy that occurs when an argument uses a word in different ways in different parts of the argument.\nFor example, consider the following argument:\nPotato chips are bad for you. That's why I never eat them.\nIn this argument, the word \"bad\" is used in two different ways. \"Bad\" means that nutritionists recommend against eating potato chips. \"Bad\" also means that eating potato chips is a moral wrong.\nThis equivocation can make the argument confusing.\nSOLUTION: Look out for words that are used in different ways. These words can indicate a fallacy of equivocation.\nThe fallacy of equivocation happens when an argument uses an emotionally charged restatement of the claim in place of support for the claim. This can make the argument seem persuasive, but it does not make the argument necessarily true.\nFor example, consider the following argument:\nThe American people want health care reform!\nThis is a fallacy of equivocation. The word \"want\" is used in two different ways:\nThe American people want health care reform.\nWanting something is a mental state. It does not necessarily mean that something is true or that something is good.\nHealth care reform is wanted by the American people.\nWanted is a transitive verb. It requires a direct object. In this case, the direct object is health care reform.\nThis argument does not tell you what the American people want. It tells you that health care reform is wanted by the American people."}

This occurs when an argument assumes that only two choices are possible, when actually there are other choices.\nAnother type of fallacy is begging the question. This occurs when an argument assumes that the thing that is being argued for is already true. In other words, the argument simply repeats the thing that is being argued for, rather than actually arguing for it.\nCircular reasoning is another type of fallacy. This occurs when an argument uses a set of assumptions to arrive at a conclusion, and those assumptions are based on the conclusion. In other words, the argument takes the form of a circle: the conclusion is used to support the assumptions, and the assumptions are used to support the conclusion.\nThe fallacy of accident is a type of fallacy in which an argument is based on a mistake of fact. This type of fallacy occurs when an argument is based on a premise that is not true.\nSOLUTION: A fallacy of accident is not the same as a false dilemma. A fallacy of accident is based on a mistake of fact, while a false dilemma assumes that only two choices are possible when actually there are other choices.\nThe argument in the lecture is based on a mistake of fact.

A validity requirement is a rule that must be followed for the argument to be valid.\nOne type of validity requirement is a requirement about the minor premise. A validity requirement of this type is that the minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent.\nThis means that the minor premise must be true and have as its conclusion an antecedent or a consequent. An antecedent is a predicate that is assigned to a subject.

A doctor may be an authority on food and health, but if she says that a certain food is good for you, it is still important to check to see if other authorities agree.\nAd nauseam is an argument that continues to repeat the same information, sometimes called \"appeal to boredom.\"\nThis type of argument is a fallacy because repeating something does not make it true.\nImagine an advocate for a certain type of food saying, \"You should eat food that is grown locally. Locally grown food is better for the environment. It is fresher. It does not have to be transported as far. So, you should eat food that is grown locally. Eat locally grown food. Eat locally grown food. Eat locally grown food.\" The part of the argument that is written in bold does not make sense. The advocate is just repeating the same words over and over."}

However, when one part of an argument uses a word or phrase differently than another part, the argument can become confusing. This can happen when someone changes the meaning of a word or phrase from one part of the argument to another.\nThere are several ways in which an argument can become confused, or unclear, because the same word or phrase is used in different ways. One way in which this can happen is through equivocation, or the use of a word or phrase with more than one meaning.\nImagine that the following paragraph is in an environmental article:\n\"Many people argue that we should use more renewable sources of energy, such as solar or wind power. But what are renewable sources of energy? Resources are a renewable source of energy if they can be replenished within a human lifetime. This means that, with the right technology and policies, we can use renewable sources of energy without running out.\"\nThe underlined part of the paragraph uses the word \"renewable\" to mean two different things. The first use of the word \"renewable\" is to describe a source of energy. The second use of the word \"renewable\" describes a type of source. So, the paragraph equivocates on the meaning of the word \"renewable.\"\nSpecial pleading is a type of fallacious reasoning.

The form of an argument is the pattern of reasoning used to come to a conclusion. The content of an argument is the specific facts and concepts that the argument uses.\nA common form of fallacy is to argue that two things are causally related without evidence of a causal relationship. This is the classical definition of the false cause fallacy.\nAn argument that uses this fallacy may have the following form:\nIt is not until the advent of television that people started spending more time alone. Therefore, television is the cause of the fact that people spend more time alone.\nThis argument commits the false cause fallacy because it claims that television is the cause of people spending more time alone without any evidence of a causal connection between the two.\nAn argument can use this fallacious form to argue for or against almost any claim. For example, the following arguments use the false cause fallacy to argue for different claims:\nSince India gained its independence in 1947, India has been a democracy. Therefore, independence is the cause of the fact that India is a democracy.\nThe number of people who drown at beaches is increasing. Therefore, the number of people who go to the beach is the cause of the increase in drownings.\nThe content of an argument may vary, but the form of the argument is the same: claiming that two things are causally related without evidence of a causal relationship.\nAnother way to commit the false cause fallacy is to substitute individual stories for a larger sample in support of a claim. This can be a way to give the appearance of evidence for a claim without actually having evidence.\nFor example, consider the following claims:\nLeCTURE: Correlation does not prove causation.\nMany people say that they have a correlation between ice cream sales and crime rates. They say that both ice cream sales and crime rates go up in the summer. But this does not prove that ice cream causes crime to go down.\nSOLUTION: Correlation does not prove causation.\nMany people say that they have a correlation between ice cream sales and crime rates. They say that both ice cream sales and crime rates go up in the summer. But this does not prove that ice cream causes crime to go down.\nOne problem with using correlation to prove causation is that correlation does not necessarily indicate that two variables are causally related.\nThese are two examples of how correlation can mistakenly indicate a causal relationship.\nMany people say that they have a correlation between ice cream sales and crime rates. They say that both ice cream sales and crime rates go up in the summer. But this does not prove that ice cream causes crime to go down.\nMany people in the United States die each year from snakebites. But no one has a correlation between snakebites and ice cream sales.\nSo, even though there is a correlation between ice cream sales and crime rates, it does not prove that ice cream causes crime to go down."}

For example, consider an argument that says a certain type of food is healthy. Some people might reject this argument because their ancestors believed that this food was unhealthy. In this case, tradition is being used as a reason to reject the argument.\nAn appeal to tradition is a type of argument. It is a reason to accept a claim. An appeal to tradition occurs when a speaker uses tradition as a reason to accept a claim.\nSOLUTION: To determine if automatically rejecting a claim just because it's traditional is reasonable, consider the following.\nAn appeal to tradition is a type of argument. It is not always a good idea to reject a claim just because it is not traditional. This is because many traditions are based on beliefs that are no longer true.\nTradition is not a reason to accept or reject a claim. This is because tradition is not based on evidence.\nMany traditions are based on old ways of doing things. They may not be based on the best available evidence.\nSo, automatically rejecting a claim just because it's traditional is not reasonable."}

Hypocrisy is when someone claims to have beliefs or opinions that are opposite to what they actually believe or like. So, being a hypocrite about a claim is being opposite to the claim.\nIf someone is a hypocrite about a claim, it is evidence that the claim is false. This is because if someone is opposite to a claim that they make, it means that the claim is opposite to what they actually believe or like. So, the claim is false.\nIf someone is not a hypocrite about a claim, then them making the claim is relevant to the truth of the claim. This is because their claim is consistent with what they actually believe or like. So, their claim is either true or false based on the merits of the claim itself.\nBeing a hypocrite about a claim is irrelevant to the claim. This means that it is not relevant to whether the claim is true or false. So, whether someone is a hypocrite about a claim tells you nothing about whether the claim is true or false.\nBeing a hypocrite about a claim is relevant only in court. This means that in a legal case, a plaintiff or defendant's hypocrisy about a claim can be used as evidence in court. But outside of a legal case, a plaintiff or defendant's hypocrisy about a claim is not relevant to the truth of the claim."}

Some fallacies occur when the arguer uses poor evidence. Other fallacies occur when the arguer uses good evidence, but does not use it correctly.\nBut how do you know which type of fallacy the argument contains? You need to figure out what the arguer's evidence was, and what the arguer's conclusion was.\nImagine an arguer who claims that if you eat a lot of cheese, you will get cancer. This argument is a slippery slope.\nThe evidence for a slippery slope argument is a series of events that the arguer claims will happen if a certain condition is not met.\nThe conclusion of a slippery slope argument is that the condition must be met to avoid the unwanted events.\nIn the example above, the evidence is a series of events that the arguer claims will happen if you eat a lot of cheese. The conclusion is that you should avoid eating a lot of cheese to avoid these events.\nSelf-evident truths are things that are so obvious that they do not need to be proved.\nAn argument that appeals to self-evident truths is not using any evidence. So, this type of argument does not use evidence to support its conclusion.\nThe conclusion could be correct, but without evidence, you have no reason to believe it.\nAn ad nauseam argument is an argument that keeps going without making progress.\nThis type of argument can start with a claim that is true. But, the argument does not use evidence to show that the claim is true. Instead, the argument keeps going in a circle, repeating the claim over and over again.\nThe conclusion could be correct, but you have no reason to believe it.\nSuppressed evidence is evidence that the arguer does not tell you about.\nThis type of fallacy occurs when the arguer does not tell you about evidence that would change your belief.
