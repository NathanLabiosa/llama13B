The Social Gospel, Social Darwinism, Communism, and the support of an urban political machine were movements that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThe Social Gospel was a movement of religious leaders who believed that Christians had a responsibility to work for social justice. They believed that poverty and inequality were social sins, and that it was the duty of society to correct these problems.\nSocial Darwinism is a misinterpretation of the ideas of Charles Darwin. It is the belief that some people are inherently superior to others because of their social or economic status. This misinterpretation was used to justify social inequality and the exploitation of the poor.\nCommunism is a political and economic theory in which all property is owned by the community as a whole. This theory was influential in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but it is no longer a dominant force in modern politics.\nAn urban political machine is a group of politicians who use the resources and authority of the government to help their friends and supporters. This type of machine is often accused of corruption and of using taxpayer money for personal gain."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nOne of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative.

The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.'

There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them.

The purposes of tariffs are to raise revenue for the government and to protect domestic industries.\nTariffs can have both positive and negative effects. One positive effect is that tariffs can help protect domestic industries. This can help keep industries in the United States, which can help keep U.S. workers employed. One negative effect is that tariffs can increase the price of imports. This can make goods more expensive for consumers.\nThe Progressive Party Platform, 1912 says that Progressives must \"maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people.\" This suggests that Progressives believed in the importance of the government representing the interests of all people.\nThe platform also says that \"this country belongs to the people who inhabit it.

Although many Democrats advocated lower duties, the tariff did include some reductions in duties. So, it is true that the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 would be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era because it included some reductions in duties.\nIt is also true that the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 would be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal.\" The Square Deal was a series of domestic reforms designed to help ordinary people. These reforms included actions to regulate businesses and protect consumers. So, the fact that the tariff included some reductions in duties could indicate that it was in line with the general philosophy of the Square Deal.\nIt is also true that the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 would be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era because they were largely opponents of Woodrow Wilson. The platform says that Progressives must \"maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people.\" This suggests that Progressives believed in the importance of the government representing the interests of all people.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following conclusions is best supported by the excerpt above?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states of the North, while McClellan won more sparsely populated states."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South to vote for Lincoln in the Election of 1864."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Republicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": ""}

It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work.

Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence.

The American Revolution was the result of a series of other things. Among the major things that contributed to the outbreak of the American Revolution were these:\nThe British government's desire to exert more control over the American colonies.\nThe American colonies' growing sense of independence from Britain.\nThe British government's use of military force to enforce its laws in the colonies.\nThe American colonies' unwillingness to pay for British military protection.\nThe American Revolution was a complex and chaotic period. One of the major factors that led to the war was the change in the British government's attitude and policies toward the American colonies. For many years, the British government had believed that the colonies were an important part of the British empire. But after the French and Indian War, the British government changed its attitude. It began to believe that the colonies were a drain on the economy and that they were too independent for their own good.\nThe new British policies included the following:\nThe imposition of new taxes on the colonies.\nThe sending of British soldiers to the colonies to enforce the new taxes and to maintain order.\nThe closing of Boston to shipping.\nThe American colonies reacted to these policies in different ways. Some colonies were more willing to cooperate with the British government than were others. But many colonists were upset. They did not want to be taxed by a government in which they did not have a say. They did not want British soldiers in their towns. And they did not want to be closed off from the rest of the world.\nAs the tension between the American colonies and the British government increased, a group of representatives from the colonies met in Philadelphia. They were trying to find a way to resolve the crisis. But they were unable to do so. The war began a few months later."}
