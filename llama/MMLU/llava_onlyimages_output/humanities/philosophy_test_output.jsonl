One of the questions that aesthetics deals with is whether beauty is objectively real or just in the eye of the beholder.\nOne of the criteria for an object to be considered beautiful is that it is essential to our existence. This means that it is necessary for our survival or happiness. For example, water is essential to our existence. We need it to survive. So, water can be considered beautiful for this reason.\nAesthetics also deals with objects that are not essential to our existence. For example, a painting or a sculpture is not essential to our existence. However, these objects can still be considered beautiful.\nAesthetics also deals with objects that are rarely viewed. These objects may be beautiful, but their beauty is not immediately apparent. For example, a scientist may be attracted to the beauty of a frog's legs. This beauty is not necessary for the scientist's survival, but it is still an important part of the scientist's existence."}
{"question": "For Socrates, an unexamined life is a tragedy because it results in grievous harm to _____.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the state"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the justice system"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the body"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the soul"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Socrates believed that an unexamined life is a tragedy because it results in grievous harm to the soul. He believed that the soul is immortal and that living an unexamined life results in the soul's destruction."}
{"question": "According to Kant, nothing can be called \u201cgood\u201d without qualification except _____.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "right action"}, {"label": "B", "text": "good consequences"}, {"label": "C", "text": "happiness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a good will"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Good will is the only thing that can be called good without qualification, according to Kant. A good will is a willing that is good in itself, not just because of the outcomes of that willing.\nHappiness, on the other hand, is not a thing that can be called good without qualification. For example, happiness can be found in selfish, harmful actions, such as lying or stealing.\nConsequences can also not be called good without qualification. A action can have good consequences, but that does not make the action itself good. For example, the consequences of stealing can include getting a lot of money, but stealing is not a good action.\nA right action is something that is good in itself, and can be called good without qualification. But a right action is not the same as a good will. A right action can be performed by someone with a good will or by someone with a bad will."}
{"question": "Plato's view is that true beauty is _____.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "found in everyday objects"}, {"label": "B", "text": "nonexistent"}, {"label": "C", "text": "everywhere in the natural world"}, {"label": "D", "text": "not of this world"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Plato believed that beauty is a form of perfection, and that forms are the real objects of love. He claimed that beautiful objects are copies of their forms, and that a truly beautiful object is a perfect copy.\nBecause of this, Plato believed that true beauty is found in forms, not in ordinary objects."}

{"question": "Rawls conceives of the original contract as one to:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "enter a particular society."}, {"label": "B", "text": "set up a particular form of government."}, {"label": "C", "text": "establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society."}, {"label": "D", "text": "establish the content of morality."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Rawls uses the thought experiment of the original position to decide how to establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society. In this thought experiment, representatives of the people decide how the society will be arranged. They do this by choosing the principles of justice for the basic structure of society. These principles will define the rights and duties of citizens and the way that the political and economic institutions of the society will work.\nThe principles of justice for the basic structure of society are the subject of the original contract. The parties to the contract decide what these principles will be. They do this by using a particular decision procedure. This procedure uses ideas of justice and fairness to decide how the society should be.\nThe content of morality includes the principles of justice. So, Rawls's conception of the original contract is as a contract to establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society."}
{"question": "According to Singer, compliance with his principle requires:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "modest changes to our personal habits, but not to our society as a whole."}, {"label": "B", "text": "modest changes to our personal habits, as well as to society."}, {"label": "C", "text": "drastic changes to our personal habits, but not to our society."}, {"label": "D", "text": "drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Look at the underlined part of the question. It tells you what Singer requires.\nAccording to Singer, compliance with his principle requires: modest changes to our personal habits, but not to our society as a whole.\nModest changes to our personal habits would include things like using less water, eating less meat, and using less electricity. Singer does not think that these changes would be enough to address the problem of climate change. So, while Singer does think that individuals should do these things, he does not think that they are enough to address the problem."}

In other words, you should only do something if you can imagine everyone else doing it too.\nFor example, imagine that everyone on the road drove as you do. Would you still be safe? If so, then your driving maxim could be a universal law.\nIf you want to make the most people happy, you would need to figure out what they want. Then, you would perform the action that leads to the greatest total happiness. This does not necessarily mean that you should act only on maxims that you can will to become universal laws.\nA perfectly virtuous person acts only on maxims that are consistent with moral laws. These maxims could include both self-interest and concern for others. For example, a perfectly virtuous person might acting on a maxim such as, \"I should always tell the truth,\" because this maxim is consistent with the moral law of treating people as ends in themselves, not as mere means.\nAccording to Kant, you should place the interests of others above the interests of yourselves. This means that you should act in ways that advance the interests of others, rather than just your own interests."}

Philosophy is not a separate discipline from other fields of study; instead, it is a way of thinking and a way of approaching problems.\nOther disciplines have their own philosophical foundations. These foundations define the concepts and methods that are used in the discipline. If these foundations are not considered carefully, they can create unresolved problems.\nAdequate philosophical foundations for a discipline help to ensure that the concepts and methods used in that discipline avoid circular reasoning and other logical fallacies. They also help to ensure that the concepts and methods used in the discipline are grounded in observation and experience.\nSOLUTION: An adequate philosophy of physics is one possible way to ensure that the concepts and methods of physics are grounded in observation and experience. If physics is to provide a reliable account of the world, it must be grounded in observation and experience.\nAn adequate philosophy of psychology is one possible way to ensure that the concepts and methods of psychology are grounded in observation and experience. Psychology is the study of mind and behavior. Like other fields of study, psychology is based on concepts and methods that are grounded in observation and experience.\nAn adequate philosophy of religion is one possible way to ensure that the concepts and methods of religion are grounded in observation and experience. Some religious traditions are based on revelation, which is not grounded in observation and experience. If philosophy does not show how the concepts and methods of religion are based on observation and experience, it may be difficult to justify the beliefs that arise from these concepts and methods.\nArt is a different way of expressing ideas and emotions. Philosophy is not a way of expressing ideas and emotions. So, an adequate philosophy of art is not a way to ensure that the concepts and methods of art are grounded in observation and experience."}

This means that the theory is about how to achieve certain goals. Mill argued that the two most important goals are happiness and virtue. So, according to Mill, one of the strongest objections to utilitarianism is drawn from the idea of duty.\nDuty-based objections to utilitarianism say that utilitarianism does not give enough weight to our moral duties. These objections claim that we have a duty to do the right thing, even if doing the right thing does not produce the greatest amount of happiness.\nJustice-based objections to utilitarianism say that utilitarianism does not give enough weight to questions of justice. These objections claim that justice is an important moral consideration, and that utilitarianism ignores it.\nVirtue-based objections to utilitarianism say that utilitarianism does not give enough weight to questions of virtue. These objections claim that we should focus on developing virtues such as honesty, compassion, and self-control. They argue that these virtues are worth pursuing, even if they do not produce the greatest amount of happiness.\nSupererogation-based objections to utilitarianism say that utilitarianism does not give enough weight to questions of supererogation. These objections claim that there are some actions that are morally required in addition to what is necessary to maximize happiness."}

Something that exists may or may not be perceived.\nTo perceive means to become aware of something through your senses.\nPerceiving is a way of becoming acquainted with existing things.\nSOLUTION: Existing and perceiving are two distinct things.\nExisting refers to the fact that something is in existence, and perceiving refers to the fact that something is being noticed or observed.\nExisting does not require perceiving. Something may exist without being perceived.\nPerceiving does not require existing. You can perceive something that does not exist."}

The fairness of this initial position is what justifies the principles of justice.\nThe fairness of the initial position is what justifies the principles of justice.\nThe principles of justice are chosen in this initial position.\nSo, the term \u201cjustice as fairness\u201d conveys the idea that the principles of justice are agreed to in an initial position that is fair."}

Negative rights are the rights not to be attacked by others. Positive rights are the rights to receive goods and services from others.\nSinger claims that his argument, that we have a duty to help others even if we are not responsible for their situation, challenges the idea that we have only negative rights. If we have positive rights, then we have a right to assistance. If we have only negative rights, then we have a right to be left alone."}

According to utilitarianism, the best action is the one that maximizes overall well-being, and the best pleasure is the one that contributes the most to overall well-being.\nOne problem with using past philosophers as a guide is that their beliefs were often shaped by the prevailing ethical theories of their times. So, for example, if a past philosopher believed that women should be excluded from the political sphere, this does not necessarily mean that Mill would agree with this view.\nSOLUTION: To determine which pleasure is more valuable, we need to figure out which pleasure can be expected to contribute the most to overall well-being. This may involve considering the specific things that give people pleasure, and the extent to which these things tend to contribute to overall well-being.\nIt may also involve consulting experts on the science of well-being, such as psychologists and economists, who can provide evidence about which things tend to contribute the most to well-being.\nConsidering the preferences of experienced people is one way to get a sense of which things tend to contribute to well-being. However, it is important to recognize that people's preferences are shaped by many factors, including their personal experiences, and that they are not always a reliable guide to what contributes to well-being.\nDetermining which pleasure is objectively most pleasurable is not a useful way to address the question of whether one pleasure is more valuable than another, because whether a pleasure is valuable depends on whether it contributes to overall well-being.\nConsulting philosophy texts from the past is not a good way to answer questions about what is valuable, because the views of past philosophers do not take into account the findings of modern science and may be shaped by outdated beliefs."}

These concepts are not objects of experience. Instead, they play a central role in his theory of ethics.\nKant argues that a good will is the only thing that is good in itself. This means that a good will is good independently of its effects. A good will is a will that is guided by the moral law, which is the principle of duty. The moral law requires that we act in accordance with the moral worth of the person, not just our own interests.\nHappiness, pleasure, and knowledge are not goods in themselves. They can be attained through the use of reason, but they are not the only things that are good."}

He maintains that the key difference between the design of a watch and the design of nature is that the former is designed to meet a specific purpose, whereas the latter is not.\nThus, the purpose of a watch is to tell time. Each part of a watch is designed to contribute to this purpose. The watch's design serves a specific function: to help people tell time.\nIn nature, the complex designs that Paley argues are examples of a designer at work serve many functions. A tree's design, for instance, serves to:\nprotect the tree from wind and sun\nsupport the tree's branches and leaves\nconduct water and nutrients through the tree's circulatory system\nA tree's design does not have a specific purpose in the same way that a watch does. Rather, a tree's design serves many functions."}

It discusses the relationship between morality and theology. The underlined text says that for Bentham, the rightness of an action depends on its utility. According to Bentham, we must first know whether something is right before we can know whether it conforms to God\u2019s will. This means that for Bentham, theology comes after morality."}

Soft determinists believe that while some events are determined, humans have free will and can choose their actions.\nSoft determinists believe that desire is a major factor in how people make choices. Desires can include both short-term and long-term goals. Soft determinists believe that people's desires are influenced by many factors, including their personal history, their environment, and their culture. But they also believe that people have some control over their desires. In particular, people can choose to work towards different goals. And different goals can lead to different desires.\nSoft determinists believe that if your desires had been different, you would have had different goals and, as a result, you would have made different choices. And since your choices are determined by your desires, this means that if your desires had been different, your choices would have been different as well."}

To decide what principles of justice to choose, people use the thought experiment of the original position. In the original position, people are choosing what principles of justice to include in their society. They do not know their own particular abilities, tastes, or social position.

{"question": "Plato's suggestion that knowledge is innate or remembered as a result of being triggered by experience is in response to a paradox he sets up for himself.

In order to answer this question, it is first necessary to understand the distinction between the realm of the Forms and the realm of becoming.\nPlato believed that there are two realms: the realm of the Forms, and the realm of becoming. The realm of the Forms is where all things are perfect. It is where the Forms, or the perfect versions of things, reside. The realm of becoming is where all things are imperfect. It is where all things that are becoming live.\nPlato believed that the human soul was composed of two parts. The part of the soul that is connected to the body lives in the realm of becoming, and it is what experiences things in this world. The part of the soul that is not connected to the body lives in the realm of the Forms, and it is where true knowledge is found. According to Plato, the part of the soul that is connected to the body remembers the Forms, and that is how we have knowledge of them.\nSo, the paradox is this: how can we have knowledge of the Forms, when that knowledge is not based on experience? Plato's suggestion is that the knowledge is not based on experience in the realm of becoming. It is not based on things that are seen and touched. Instead, the knowledge is innate. It is remembered."}

The question is whether Socrates is saying that the examined life is worth living, or whether he is saying that the unexamined life is not worth living.\nThe last sentence of the passage suggests that Socrates is indeed saying that the unexamined life is not worth living.

A moral rule is a genuine moral rule if it is based on a principle that people can in principle agree is important to follow. A moral rule that is not based on such a principle is not a genuine moral rule. According to Baier, we do not have to follow the moral rules of our group. Instead, we should decide for ourselves which moral rules to follow. If we find a moral rule that is based on a principle we believe is important, we will follow that rule. If we do not find such a moral rule, we will not follow it.\nIf a moral rule is not a genuine moral rule, it is not a moral rule at all.

This means that moral laws are not contingent on cultural norms or personal preferences. Instead, they are based on the nature of reason itself.\nAccording to Kant, moral laws are derived from the concept of the moral law, which is the highest good. This concept tells you what to do to achieve the highest good.

To answer these questions, we need to figure out what we ought to do.\nAccounts of how we ought to live from the perspective of a well-ordered system of values are normative. Such accounts are based on the commitment to a particular moral theory or set of moral principles.\nAn example of a moral theory is deontology. Deontological theories make claims about what is right or wrong in any situation, independent of the consequences of an action.\nAn example of a moral principle is utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory: it holds that an action is right if and only if it produces the best overall outcome.\nFrom the point of view of virtue, a person is a virtuous person to the extent that he has virtues. Virtues are character traits that make people outstanding in some respect.\nIndividual perfection is about achieving personal excellence. It does not say that we should always be perfect; it says that we should always strive to be perfect.\nA perspective that is unattached to a commitment to any well-ordered system of values is a perspective that is not concerned with how we ought to live. From this perspective, the questions of what is good or right, and what we ought to do, are not answered.\nSOLUTION: When Wolf claims that ultimately, normative questions must be assessed from the moral point of view, he is arguing that we should use moral theories or principles to answer normative questions.\nFrom the moral point of view, what is right or wrong in a given situation can depend on the moral principles or theory that we use to guide our actions. So, to answer a normative question, we need to figure out which moral theory or principle should be used to answer that question."}

But this does not mean that moral values do not exist. Instead, Sartre believed that individuals must create their own values through their choices and actions.\nHe also believed that if moral values are not tied to God or nature, then they must come from human beings. But this means that individuals must take responsibility for their own values and choices. This can be daunting, but it can also be empowering, as individuals can use their freedom to choose to create a meaningful life."}

The sense of time that pessimists are accused of considering is the chronological sense.\nThe chronological sense of time is the way that time is arranged in a sequence. This is the sense of time that supports the idea that the future will be different from the past.\nThe philosopher J. M. Keynes argued that the chronological sense of time is supported by our intuitions about the future. Keynes believed that we have a strong intuition that the future will be different from the past.

The end can be described as the intended result, or the goal that the action is meant to achieve.\nAquinas believed that the end of every action is some good. A good is something that is desired. It is worth noting that a good can be both universal and particular. A universal good is something that is desired by everyone. A particular good is something that is desired by someone.\nSome pleasures are universal. For example, the pleasure of eating is universal. But not all pleasures are universal. Some pleasures are particular. For example, the pleasure of listening to a particular song is particular.\nSome desires are universal. For example, the desire to live is universal. But not all desires are universal. Some desires are particular. For example, the desire to eat a particular type of food is particular.\nAn emotional state is a state of feeling. An emotional state can be caused by an action. But the end of an action is not an emotional state."}

He argues that philosophy is not for the young, because the young are too easily distracted by pleasure and too focused on their desires to understand the complex arguments of philosophers.\nPhilosophy is also not for the old, who are too set in their ways to have the flexibility and open-mindedness that philosophy requires.\nSo, philosophy is important, but it can also be unpleasant, because it demands a great deal of critical thinking and can challenge one's most deeply held beliefs."}

A work of art is not the same as a roadside billboard, which is designed to convey information. A work of art is intended to evoke an emotional response.\nEmotions are subjective, and each work of art can evoke different ones. A work of art may evoke a variety of powerful emotions. A powerful evocation of emotion is an important formal characteristic of art."}
{"question": "According to Hobbes, in the condition of man in which there is a state of war of everyone against everyone, every man has a right to _____.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "some things"}, {"label": "B", "text": "lawful treatment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "due process"}, {"label": "D", "text": "everything"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: In the condition of man in which there is a state of war of everyone against everyone, there is no government to enforce laws. So, every man has a right to use force to defend himself. This means that in the state of nature, every man has a right to do some things.\nBut in the state of nature, there is also a lack of lawful treatment and due process. So, the right to some things does not include a right to lawful treatment or due process."}

The argument does not appeal to fear, or to universalizability. Nor does it rely on the debtors' behavior, or on the fact that the debtors borrowed the money.\nThe argument does consider the effects of imprisoning A. It argues that this would cause the debtors' families to suffer. It also suggests that the debtors might be more likely to repay their loans if A is not imprisoned."}

Justice, according to Hume, has value in part because it is useful to society. This means that the satisfaction of desires is the reason for the value of justice.\nHume does not believe that something is good because it is useful to the agent. He does not believe that something is good because it is useful to someone other than the agent. And he does not believe that something is good because it is beautiful, or because it is the mean between two extremes, or for any other reason that does not include some reference to the satisfaction of desires."}

She does not claim that defining terms is the most fundamental question in ethics.\nDefining terms is important for ethical discussions. For example, if you say that it is wrong to kill, and your listener thinks that killing is sometimes justified, you have a disagreement. One reason for this disagreement is that you have different ideas about what killing means. Defining the term killing could prevent this disagreement.\nBut defining terms is not the most fundamental question in ethics. The most fundamental question in ethics is about what is good and how to decide what is good."}

{"question": "According to Kant, the moral worth of an action depends on:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the moral character of the agent who performs it."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the consequences of the action."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the maxim that is acted on."}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Kant argues that the moral worth of an action depends on all of the above.\nA action's consequences are one thing that can affect the moral worth of an action. But for a action to have moral worth, it must also be done for the right reason. This right reason is called a maxim. A maxim is a principle that guides the agent's choice of actions.\nAccording to Kant, the moral worth of an action depends on the maxim that is acted on. A action is done on a maxim. To have moral worth, a action must be done on a maxim that is consistent with the moral law.\nThe moral character of the agent who performs an action can also affect the moral worth of the action. An agent who performs an action from a sense of duty to others, for example, may be considered to have a stronger moral character than an agent who performs the same action only out of self-interest."}

It says that Nussbaum argues that our debates about homosexuality are a continuation of debates in the Greek world about sexuality. The passage also says that Nussbaum believes that these debates are not useful."}
{"question": "To say that \"philosophy\" (like \"love\" or \"art\") is not a closed concept means that we cannot state the necessary and sufficient conditions by which it is defined.

In other words:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the way we come to think about philosophy, love, or art really depends on how we were raised by our families to identify things as resembling one another."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the necessary and sufficient condition for something to be considered philosophic is that it answers either of these questions: What does it mean? and How do you know?"}, {"label": "D", "text": "philosophy is not a closed discipline insofar as it is willing to accept any answer suggested by the \"human family\" as being true."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Philosophy is not a closed discipline. This means that it is not a discipline in which every question has a predetermined answer. Instead, philosophy is a discipline that involves the questioning of certain basic assumptions.\nTo say that a discipline is not closed means that the necessary and sufficient condition for an answer to be considered correct is not that it be true in some objective sense. Instead, the condition is that it be accepted as true by the community of scholars in the discipline.\nThis criterion of acceptance by a community of scholars is not the same as the criterion of truth. Truth is not determined by a democratic process. Whether a certain answer is true does not depend on how many people in the community of scholars believe it.\nIf a certain answer is not true, nothing can make it true. If a certain answer is true, nothing can make it false."}

To determine what our intuitions are, we need to reflect on what we really think. Thus, reflecting on what we really think is the first step in constructing a moral theory.\nConsulting social conventions is not the same as reflecting on what we really think. Consulting social conventions involves looking at what other people say is right and wrong. This can be useful, but it is not the same as reflecting on what we really think.\nLogical proofs for moral principles are not the same as reflecting on what we really think. Logical proofs can be useful for understanding what we believe. However, they are not the same as reflecting on what we really think.\nScripture is a set of texts that people use for spiritual guidance. It is not the same as reflecting on what we really think. Consulting scripture may help you understand what you should do. But it is not the same as reflecting on what you really think."}

It tells you why Aquinas said what he did.\nAquinas believed that human beings have a natural desire to know the truth and to act on the truth. This desire is what leads people to contemplate the truth. And to contemplate the truth, people have to be able to act on it. So, Aquinas claimed that all human operations appear to serve those who contemplate the truth."}

He wrote extensively on topics such as ethics, free will, and the relationship between God and humanity.\nAugustine's doctrine of divine grace is closely tied to his theory of free will. According to Augustine, God's grace is necessary for human beings to make decisions that are in accordance with God's will. He argued that human beings are prone to make decisions that are self-centered and prone to sin.\nAugustine believed that God's grace is available to all human beings. However, he also believed that human beings can resist God's grace. If a human being chooses to resist God's grace and persist in sin, then that human being is guilty of wickedness.\nAugustine distinguished between two types of ignorance. One type of ignorance is invincible, which means that it is not the fault of the person who is ignorant. The other type of ignorance is vincible, which means that it is the fault of the person who is ignorant. Augustine believed that it is never justifiable to sin through invincible ignorance. But he also believed that it is possible to sin through vincible ignorance, which means that humans can err in their decisions.\nAugustine believed that God's grace can help a person avoid wickedness and the temptations that lead to it. But he also believed that human beings have a tendency to give in to temptation. So, Augustine allowed that humans can err through temptation.\nIn summary, Augustine held that humans can never err when they follow God's will. But he also believed that humans can err through wickedness, ignorance, or temptation."}

Science can provide us with true beliefs about the world.\nEthics involves making decisions and taking actions that are right or just. Ethics can provide us with true beliefs about what is right or just.\nBoth involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. Testing the logical consequences of general principles can help to clarify the principles and identify any contradictions among them. This can be a useful part of both scientific and ethical inquiry.\nBoth are essential components of a worthwhile life.

The parties in the original position do not know their own preferences or values, and they do not know how society will turn out. They are deciding what principles to adopt to govern their society.\nThese parties would not accept utilitarianism because it requires doing unjust things, such as executing innocent people. Rawls believes that people have a sense of justice that is independent of their individual interests. So, utilitarianism, which allows for actions that cause harm to some people if those actions benefit the greater good, would be seen as unjust by those in the original position who are behind the veil of ignorance."}

A definition is a set of words that describe the meaning of a term.\nDefinitions can do one of the following:\nstate the meaning of a term\ndefine a term in terms of other terms\nboth state the meaning of a term and define it in terms of other terms\nWhen a definition states the meaning of a term, the definition is synthetic. When a definition defines a term in terms of other terms, the definition is analytic.\nBe careful when you are assessing whether a definition analyzes, elucidates, or defines a term. How a definition treats a term depends on how it is phrased.\nA definition that states the meaning of a term is synthetic.\nA definition that defines a term in terms of other terms is analytic.\nA definition that analytically defines a term in terms of other terms does not provide a definition that is accessible to someone who is not already familiar with the terms in the definition. So, analytic definitions do not help you learn the meaning of a term.\nA definition that synthetically defines a term by describing its references does not provide a definition that is accessible to someone who is not already familiar with the terms in the definition. So, synthetic definitions do not help you learn the meaning of a term.\nWhen you write an essay, you can use definitions to help your reader understand the terms you are using. You do this by writing a non-definitive use of a term and then following it with its definition. This is called defining a term.\nDefining a term in this way can help your reader understand the meaning of a term. But defining a term does not do the following:\nresolve disputes in which the terms are used\nchange the meanings of the terms\nYou can use definitions to help your reader understand the terms you are using. You can also use them to help you think about the terms. But definitions do not change the meanings of the terms."}

He proposed that the chief characteristic of physical things is that they have extension. This means that physical things take up space. Descartes believed that extension was the primary characteristic that distinguished physical things from mental things.\nSOLUTION: Descartes argued that physical things do not have thoughts or feelings, but they do have extension. They occupy space."}

He says that a watch has the following features: it shows purposefulness, it has a structure, it runs well, and it is engraved.\nPaley's argument is that a watch has all these features. So, according to Paley, a watch had an intelligent designer if it shows purposefulness, has a structure, runs well, or is engraved."}

To do this, the sanction must cause pleasure or pain. This pleasure or pain should be inflicted by people who are not the target of the behavior. For example, a judge who inflicts a fine on someone who has broken the law is not a \"chance member of the community.\" But the pleasures and pains of other people who follow the rules of the community (such as the victim of an assault) can be used to sanction the offender."}

This skepticism is different from philosophical skepticism, which claims that we can never have justification for our beliefs.\nAugustine's claim is that academic skepticism is true, and that it can be proven. To prove this, he needs to show that we should be skeptical about our beliefs, and that we should question the assumptions we make about the world.\nTo be skeptical about our beliefs means to be open to the idea that some of our beliefs may be false. This is a reasonable position to take. After all, we do not want to hold onto beliefs that are false.\nTo question the assumptions we make about the world means to look at the evidence and to be willing to change our beliefs if the evidence leads us to do so. This is also a reasonable position to take. For example, if we observe that certain plants do not grow well in our garden, we may need to change our assumptions about how to care for these plants.\nSo, Augustine's claim is true, and can be proven."}

An argument can be strong or weak.\nA strong argument is one in which the conclusion follows from the premises with logically necessary inferences.\nA weak argument is one in which the conclusion follows from the premises with logically possible, but not necessarily necessary, inferences.\nIn order to determine whether a argument is valid, you need to figure out whether the conclusion follows from the premises. You can do this by evaluating the type of inference that each line of the argument uses.\nThere are several types of inferential structures that are committed to by the lines of a valid argument. This means that, if the premises are true, the conclusion in each of these types of arguments must be true.\nOne of these types of inferential structures is modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid argument. It is a structure that is committed to by the following argument:\nIf you assume that a set of statements is true, and yet you can deduce a false or absurd statement from it, then the original set of statements as a whole must be false.\nThis is a valid argument.\nIf you want to prove that a set of statements is false, you can assume that the statements are true and show that you can deduce a false or absurd statement from them.\nThis type of argument is a reductio ad absurdum.\nA reductio ad absurdum is a valid argument. It is a structure that is committed to by the following argument:\nIf you want to prove that a set of statements is false, you can assume that the statements are true and show that you can deduce a false or absurd statement from them.\nIf the assumption leads to a false or absurd conclusion, the original set of statements must be false.\nThis argument is a reductio ad absurdum.\nA hypothetical syllogism is not committed to by the following argument:\nIf you want to prove that a set of statements is false, you can assume that the statements are true and show that you can deduce a false or absurd statement from them.\nThis is a hypothetical syllogism.\nA hypothetical syllogism is an argument with the following form: If A is true, then B must be true. If B is true, then C must be true. So, if A is true, then C must be true.\nThis is a valid argument.\nHowever, a hypothetical syllogism is not committed to by the following argument:\nIf you want to prove that a set of statements is false, you can assume that the statements are true and show that you can deduce a false or absurd statement from them."}

Instead, the moral law is given to each person by the fact that they are an end in themselves.\nKant believes that each person has intrinsic worth and value, simply by being a human being. This means that each person is an end in themselves, and not a means to some other end. As an end in themselves, each person is worthy of respect and moral consideration.\nThe moral law is derived from this concept of respect for persons. It tells each person their duties to themselves and to others. It is the same for all people, and is not determined by society, one's own will, God, or nature."}

Today, aesthetics is a subfield in philosophy, and questions from aesthetics are often addressed by philosophers.\nCritics are interested in aesthetics as well. However, their main concern is with how a work of art or literature looks, sounds, or tastes. They do not necessarily ask questions about the nature of beauty itself.\nNo one is interested in aesthetics. This statement is false.

They are two different ways that people have come to answer this question.\nThe external view is a perspective on the meaning of life. It is not an answer to the question.\nThe pessimist's view and the optimist's view are not answers to the question.

This means that when you use renewable energy, you are more likely to get more of the same type of energy in the future. For example, if you use solar energy, you are likely to get solar energy again the next day.\nNon-renewable energy sources are less fecund than renewable sources. This means that when you use non-renewable energy, you are less likely to get more of the same type of energy in the future.

This means that happiness is the highest good of human action.\nThis does not mean that happiness is the highest good of human life. Aristotle's argument is that to achieve the highest good of human life, which is happiness, one has to achieve the highest good of human action.\nHappiness is not the same as pleasure. Aristotle's idea is that happiness is not just pleasure, but is the highest good of human action."}

You can represent an infinite regress graphically as a circle, with each point on the circle representing a event. An infinite regress is not a finite series.\nThomas Aquinas argued that an infinite regress of causes is impossible. This means that, according to Aquinas, it is impossible for there to be an infinite regress of causes.\nSOLUTION: Look at the answer: C.\nFinite: A finite series is a series that has a first event and a final event. An infinite regress is not a finite series.\nPossible: A possible series is a series that can happen. An infinite regress is impossible, so it is not a possible series.\nImpossible: An impossible series is a series that cannot happen.

He did this by pointing out that humans, like animals, have bodies. Bodies do things. The things that they do include both voluntary and involuntary operations. Voluntary operations are things that you do on purpose. Involuntary operations are things that your body does on its own.\nInstinctive behavior is a type of instinct. An instinct is an unconscious drive to do something. Instinctive behavior is behavior that is done on purpose but without conscious thought.\nIrrational behavior is behavior that is not based on a recognition of the need for it.

He believed that death is the end of existence, but that we have no reason to yearn for life after death, or to fear what happens after death.\nEpicurus also believed that the wise person is not bothered by the idea of death. His goal was to be happy, and he believed that death was not relevant to that goal.\nEpicurus is not alone in his beliefs. Many other philosophers and thinkers have argued that death is not something to be feared."}
{"question": "To illustrate the attempt to do injustice with impunity, Cicero considers the story of:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the ring of Gyges."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Icarus."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Achilles and Agamemnon."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Oedipus the King."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Cicero's example is a reference to Plato's Republic. In Book II of the Republic, Plato uses the story of the ring of Gyges to argue that people will use their power to do injustice if they believe they can get away with it.\nThe ring of Gyges was a mythical ring that gave its wearer the power to become invisible. In Plato's story, the hero Glaucon uses the ring as an example to illustrate that people are not naturally just, but rather, they are just only if they believe they can be caught for their unjust actions."}
{"question": "Epicurus states that of all the things required for a complete life, the greatest is:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "honor."}, {"label": "B", "text": "friendship."}, {"label": "C", "text": "luxury."}, {"label": "D", "text": "good food."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Epicurus was a philosopher who believed that the secret to a happy life was to find the balance between pain and pleasure. For Epicurus, pleasure was not the same as luxury or self-indulgence. Rather, pleasure was the natural state of balance and tranquility that one could achieve by avoiding pain and discomfort.\nEpicurus believed that there are three kinds of desires: necessary desires, natural desires, and unnatural desires. Necessary desires are the desires that are required for a human being to live. Friendship is one of the necessary desires. Good food is also one of the necessary desires.\nHonor and luxury are not necessary desires. They do not help one live a complete life. In fact, honor and luxury can even be painful. If one has to work too hard to get honor, or if one has to spend all of one's money on luxury items, then these things can cause pain and discomfort."}

{"question": "According to Plato, we can attain knowledge only by seeing beyond this world of particular, changing objects to the true essences or Forms in terms of which things in this world are intelligible.

In ethics, empirical methods can involve gathering data about the effects of various policies or interventions, for example.\nAccording to Stevenson, empirical methods are sometimes useful in resolving ethical disagreement. He does not think that they are the only way to do ethics, or that they provide the only responsible way to engage in moral philosophy. He also does not think that empirical methods are never useful in resolving ethical disagreement. So, Stevenson thinks that empirical methods are sometimes useful, but not always sufficient."}

Many existentialists believe that traditional philosophy has tried to avoid the problem of human existence by focusing on abstract theories. Existentialists, by contrast, think that philosophy should focus on the problems of everyday life.\nOne of the key questions in existentialist thought is: \"What is the meaning of life?\" To answer this question, existentialists look to the individual's subjective experience. They believe that individuals can create their own meanings in life, and that there is no one objective meaning to life.\nSOLUTION: According to Sartre, what existentialists have in common is that they think that existence precedes essence. This means that individuals create their own meanings and values in life, rather than inheriting them from a predetermined essence or purpose."}

Ethical egoism is the view that people ought to act in their own self-interest. Psychological hedonism is the view that people always act to maximize their own pleasure.\nFeinberg argues that psychological egoism is incorrect. He contends that people sometimes act to please others, even if doing so does not maximize their own pleasure. So, psychological egoism is false.\nHowever, Feinberg argues that psychological hedonism is true. People do sometimes act to maximize their own pleasure. So, psychological hedonism is not refuted by Feinberg's arguments."}

This view is supported by many different considerations, which together form a coherent picture.\nDirect acquaintance via moral intuition is one way in which we can become aware of the content of justice as fairness. But this is not the same as justifying the theory. To justify the theory, we need to show that it fits into a coherent view of the good.\nDeducing a conception of justice from self-evident premises would justify it. But Rawls does not believe that there are any self-evident premises about justice. So, this is not how a conception of justice should be justified, according to Rawls."}

One can choose to respond to an impression in a certain way, or one may choose to ignore an impression.\nOne's body is not under one's control. One's body is subject to external forces, such as disease and aging.\nOne's family and one's friends are not under one's control. One does not get to choose one's family, and one's friends may choose to no longer be a part of one's life."}

So, for something to be good, it must be desirable.\nDesirability is a matter of individual preference. So, what makes an action, object, or outcome good is that it is desired by most people.\nHappiness is produced by the successful pursuit of desired ends. So, what makes an action, object, or outcome good is that it is conducive to human happiness. This means that the more people who desire it, the better it is."}

It tells you what Moore claims. \"Moore claims that there is no meaning in saying that pleasure is good, unless: goodness and pleasure are the same thing.\"\nAccording to the question, Moore is claiming that these two things are the same thing. So, these two things are goodness and pleasure.\nNow look at each choice. Figure out which definition of goodness matches the claim in the question.\nAll good things are pleasant. This means that the pleasure will follow goodness. This does not define goodness as the same thing as pleasure.\nGood is something different than pleasure. This means that goodness and pleasure are not the same thing.\nGoodness and pleasure are the same thing. This definition is in line with Moore's claim.\nAll pleasant things are good. This means that all things that are pleasant are good. This does not define goodness as the same thing as pleasure."}

These rules would be the same in all settings, but they would be applied differently depending on the context.\nSo, in an ideal institutional setting, one is obligated to follow the ideal moral rules. But the ideal moral rules would also hold one obligated to follow the rules of the actual institutional setting in which one happens to be.\nFor example, the ideal moral rules would hold one obligated to follow the rules of a hospital, even if one is not a patient or a medical professional. But the ideal moral rules would also hold one obligated to follow the rules of a battlefield, where the rules are different.\nIn a setting devoid of institutions, one is obligated to follow the ideal moral rules. But these rules are not practical in a setting without any institutions.\nIn a world in which everyone complied with those rules perfectly, the rules would be effective, but these rules do not exist.\nIn one\u2019s actual institutional setting, one is obligated to do what the actual moral rules require.

We can do this by entering the original position.\nThe original position is a thought experiment. It is not a real place. We can enter the original position by using our imagination to picture ourselves in this position.\nWe can enter the original position at any time by following a certain procedure. This procedure involves adopting a particular way of thinking. We are to imagine that we do not know our own position in society. We are to choose principles of justice that we would want to govern our society, if we did not know whether we would be born rich or poor, healthy or handicapped, black or white.\nForgeting who we are is one way to enter the original position. Another way is to use a role-playing game. In this game, each person is given a different set of information about the society. Some people are told they will be born rich, others will be born poor. Some will be told they will be healthy, others will be told they will be handicapped. By acting out their choices in the game, players can experience what it is like to enter the original position."}

This desire is called a sense of duty. According to Mill, a sense of duty is not derived from self-interest, but from the interests of others.\nMill argues that the only way to find a basis for duty is to look for the desires that are most likely to produce happiness. He contends that a sense of duty is based on the desire to produce the greatest amount of happiness. Therefore, a desire to do what is right is desirable as part of one's happiness."}

Instead, a virtue is a complex, unified trait that involves multiple facets.\nAristotle's account of each virtue includes a list of the facets of the trait. For example, courage is a virtue, and the list of facets of courage includes standing up to fear, anger, and other adversaries.\nEach facet of a virtue is an essential part of the virtue. If a person lacks any of the facets, then that person is not fully virtuous.\nTo be motivated by a virtue, a person must have a story to tell. This story must include the details of how the person came to have the virtue.\nThe story must include the details of how the person came to have the virtue.

{"question": "According to Gauthier, deliberative justification:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "is refuted by moral requirements."}, {"label": "B", "text": "is replaced once we acknowledge moral requirements."}, {"label": "C", "text": "refutes morality."}, {"label": "D", "text": "ignores morality and seemingly replaces it."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Deliberative justification is a way of explaining why someone is justified in doing something. According to Gauthier, deliberative justification is a matter of considering the reasons for and against a course of action. If the reasons for a course of action outweigh the reasons against it, then that course of action is justified.\nGauthier claims that moral requirements can be included in deliberative justification. This is not a matter of adding in some extra reasons, but rather of weighing the reasons for and against a course of action. The moral requirements are included in the reasons against certain courses of action. For example, as Gauthier explains, \"a moral requirement that one should not tell lies includes in itself the reason not to tell lies.\" So, if deliberative justification is based on a consideration of reasons, including moral requirements in this way does not add any extra weight to the scale. Instead, it shifts the balance.\nSome people have criticized Gauthier's account of moral requirements. One criticism is that it is not clear how moral requirements can be included in deliberative justification. After all, moral requirements seem to be background assumptions that are not up for deliberation. If you include moral requirements in the reasons for or against a course of action, then it seems that you are engaging in deliberation about those requirements. But if you are engaging in deliberation about the requirements, then it seems that the requirements are not background assumptions.\nAnother criticism is that Gauthier's account of moral requirements is too weak. According to this criticism, moral requirements provide more weight to the reasons against certain courses of action than Gauthier allows. So, even if the reasons for a course of action outweigh the reasons against it, the additional weight provided by the moral requirements may still make the course of action unjustified."}

The stronger version says that we can directly affect the well-being of others. The weaker version says that we can indirectly affect the well-being of others through our choices of how to affect others directly.\nHe considers the stronger version to be correct. He believes that what we do directly affects the well-being of others."}

This parable is about a master who entrusts his servants with different amounts of money to invest while he is gone. When the master returns, he congratulates the servants who invested the money well and condemns the servant who did not.\nThe lesson of the parable is that human beings are given different skills and abilities, and they will be judged based on what they do with these talents. This implies that human beings are not independent and autonomous individuals, and they are not part of the animal kingdom. It also implies that human beings are not all a part of one body or all a part of God."}

In his Meditations, Descartes uses the cogito, or \"I think, therefore I am,\" as a foundation for his claim that knowledge is possible.\nOne of the key elements of Descartes' method is to doubt everything. He asks skeptical questions to try to find a foundation for knowledge that is unshakable. One of the things he doubts is his senses. He asks, \"At first, I suppose that everything I see is true. But in the Grand Dream, I saw that everything I see can be a delusion. So, at first, I suppose that everything I see is part of me. But I am a thinking thing. So, part of me is thinking and part of me is not. Therefore, it is impossible for me to see everything I see is part of me.\"\nSOLUTION: Descartes is trying to find a foundation for knowledge that is unshakable. He is not sure if what he sees is true. So, at first, he supposes that everything he sees is part of him. But he is a thinking thing. So, part of him is thinking and part of him is not. He is not his thoughts. He is a thinking thing that has thoughts. So, it is impossible for him to see everything he sees is part of him."}

It goes on to say that the distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth. This means that the only way to find the truth is to look at how things appear and then determine what is real. This is different from the claim that appearances are the only real way we have for knowing reality.\nThe passage also says that even though societies or individuals appear to differ about what is required for the good life, that in no way contradicts the fact that there are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life. This means that there are standards that are not just a matter of opinion. These standards can help you determine what is right or wrong, true or false."}

Some rules are impossible to follow. This means that, for some situations, following the rule would lead to a morally unacceptable outcome.\nAn example of a morally impossible rule would be:\nAlways lie.\nThis rule is impossible to follow because lying is inherently morally wrong.\nAnother example of a morally impossible rule would be:\nAlways do whatever brings about the greatest happiness.\nThis rule is impossible to follow because the greatest happiness is a subjective concept. What makes one person happy may not make another person happy.\nA rule that is not impossible to follow might include the following:\nAlways assert what you don\u2019t think to be the case.\nThis rule is not impossible to follow because it does not require you to do anything morally wrong.\nLICTURE: Imagine an engineer needs to decide whether to build a bridge in a windy location. The bridge must meet safety standards for high wind. To figure out what standards to use, the engineer turns to the literature on wind loads.\nThe literature reports that, for a two-foot-diameter tree in high wind, the wind load is about 0.56 times the wind load on a 4-inch-diameter tree. The engineer needs to figure out what this means in terms of safety standards for the bridge.\nFirst, the engineer needs to figure out the wind load on a 4-inch-diameter tree. The literature reports that the wind load on a 4-inch-diameter tree is 1.05 lbs per square foot.\nThen, the engineer can calculate the wind load on a two-foot-diameter tree. To do this, the engineer multiplies the wind load on a 4-inch-diameter tree by 0.56.\nThis means that the wind load on a two-foot-diameter tree is 0.56 x 1.05 = 0.58 lbs per square foot."}

According to Locke, people give up their natural freedom to governments in order to protect their natural rights. In return, governments are expected to provide the basic rights to life, liberty, and property.\nOne of the ways in which governments can protect people's rights is by making and enforcing laws. Laws are made by the consent of the governed. So, in a government based on the social contract, the majority of the people will make the laws that everyone is expected to follow."}

This view is consistent with a unitary concept of the soul.\nSoul-body dualism implies that the soul and the body are two separate things. This view is inconsistent with a unitary concept of the soul.\nThe biblical account of the soul is described as at odds with soul-body dualism. This means that the biblical account of the soul and the concept of soul-body dualism are fundamentally incompatible.\nThe monistic soul is a unitary concept of the soul. So, the identity theory and a monistic soul are consistent with each other."}

In other words, a argument that begs the question uses its own conclusions as some of its premises.\nMoore argues that many past philosophers have defined good in terms of what is desired or what is approved. He claims that this definition is problematic because it makes good just a matter of what people desire or approve. This means that if everyone desired or approved of something, that thing would be good. Moore claims that this definition of good begs the question because it makes the content of good a matter of what people desire or approve.\nCircular reasoning occurs when an argument assumes what it sets out to prove. In other words, a argument that is circular uses its conclusion as one of its premises.\nThe passage does not contain circular reasoning. Moore is not assuming that good is a matter of what is desired or what is approved. Instead, he is questioning this definition of good.\nThe naturalistic fallacy occurs when someone defines a non-natural property in terms of natural properties.\nMoore is not committing the naturalistic fallacy. He is not trying to define good in terms of natural properties.\nInstead, Moore is questioning the definition of good that makes good just a matter of what is desired or what is approved.\nThe ad hominem fallacy occurs when an argument attacks the person making the argument instead of dealing with the argument itself.\nThe passage does not contain an ad hominem fallacy. Moore is not attacking the person who defines good as a matter of what is desired or what is approved. Instead, he is questioning the definition itself."}

According to Aristotle, we should begin ethical inquiry by specifying what our fundamental duties are.\nAristotle believed that we should live in accordance with virtue, which means living a life of virtuous character. To do this, we must fulfill our fundamental duties, which include both moral duties (duties related to justice and fairness) and social duties (duties related to family and community).\nIn order to determine what our fundamental duties are, we need to figure out what would make us happy. According to Aristotle, living a life of virtue is essential to human happiness. So, by figuring out our fundamental duties, we can also determine what we ought to do to lead a happy life."}

He did not believe that wealth was the source of happiness. In fact, he believed that wealth could act as a distraction from happiness. So, for Epicurus, the wealth required for a good life was not available only to the rich or the gods. It was also not attainable for everyone, but only through great effort.\nEpicurus did not believe that wealth was easily procured. Instead, he believed that wealth could create problems and distractions that would stand in the way of a good life."}

Virtue ethicists argue that a fundamentally important part of being a good person is to practice virtue in all that you do. So, according to Hobbes, one of the laws of nature is to practice virtue in all that you do.\nPracticing virtue in all that you do is a broad principle that can be interpreted in many ways. One way to live up to this principle is to treat others with respect and not to do anything to them that you would not want them to do to you. This is known as the golden rule.\nAnother way to practice virtue in all that you do is to maximize happiness. This means that you should do everything you can to be as happy as possible, and you should help others to be happy too.\nPracticing virtue in all that you do is different from the other answer choices. It is not the same as doing your best to achieve your goals, as doing your best to achieve your goals can involve doing things that are not virtuous. For example, cheating on an exam might help you achieve your goal of getting a good grade, but it is not the sort of thing that a virtuous person would do.\nPracticing virtue in all that you do is also different from never treating another person as a means to your ends. According to this principle, you should treat people with respect and not use them to achieve your own goals. This is a good thing to do, but it is not the same as practicing virtue in all that you do."}

Habit is a form of experience. When you do something repeatedly, you get used to doing it. Habit can also include things you do unconsciously.\nAristotle believed that we can acquire virtues by repeatedly doing what is virtuous. For example, if you consistently tell the truth, you will acquire the virtue of honesty."}

It involves both negative and positive obligations, or duties.\nMill claims that the concept of justice follows from the fact that individuals have both strong and weak claims on each other. These strong and weak claims correspond to the distinction between positive and negative duties.\nA strong duty is a duty to assist or benefit someone. A weak duty is a duty not to harm or exploit someone.\nThese strong and weak duties are the building blocks of justice. They show up in a variety of different institutions and practices that track how strongly or weakly one person is obligated to assist or benefit another.\nSome of these institutions and practices include:\nthe law of contracts, which reflects strong duties to keep promises and the law of torts, which reflects strong duties not to harm others.\nProperty rights, which reflect weak duties not to harm others by damaging or taking their property.\nSocial welfare programs, which reflect strong duties to assist others who are in need."}

He wrote extensively on the nature of happiness and the human condition.\nAugustine believed that happiness, or beatitude, is the highest goal of human life. He defined happiness as a state of perfect peace and contentment. To achieve happiness, he claimed that one must know the causes of good and evil.\nAugustine's view is that humans are beset by a sense of restlessness and dissatisfaction, and that this state of affairs arises from the human tendency to try to find ultimate meaning and purpose in things that are not the ultimate source of meaning and purpose. Augustine called this tendency \"misdirected love.\" He believed that humans can find true happiness only by directing their love toward God, who is the ultimate source of meaning and purpose.\nSOLUTION: Augustine's claim that to be happy, one must know the causes of good and evil is central to his philosophy. Augustine did not believe that happiness could be achieved by understanding the causes of natural occurrences."}

{"question": "Baier argues that moral rules:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "always must be applied to everyone alike."}, {"label": "B", "text": "must applied to everyone alike in the absence of morally relevant differences."}, {"label": "C", "text": "only apply to some members of a group."}, {"label": "D", "text": "are the same in every society."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Baier argues that moral rules apply to everyone alike in the absence of morally relevant differences.\nMoral rules are rules that people may choose to follow because they have a moral reason to do so. Such rules always apply to everyone alike. But the reason they apply to everyone alike is that everyone is morally relevantly the same.\nEveryone is morally relevantly the same in the sense that everyone is a person. And being a person is a morally relevant difference.\nBaier thinks that the idea that people are persons is the central idea in Western ethics. A person is a being that is self-conscious and self-directing.\nThere are many ways in which people may differ from each other. But these differences are not morally relevant. They do not show that people are not persons, or that they may be treated differently.\nSome examples of ways in which people may differ from each other include their age, their sex, their race, and their abilities. None of these differences are morally relevant.\nBeing a person is a morally relevant difference. It is a difference that makes a difference to how people may be treated.\nBaier does not claim that there are no other morally relevant differences. But she does claim that being a person is the most important morally relevant difference."}

The first component is a theory of practical reasoning. This theory should tell you how to decide what is right or wrong. The second component is a theory of the emotions. This theory should explain how moral judgments can influence your emotions. The third component is a theory of the will. This theory should explain how moral judgments can influence your behavior.\nAnother way to get an adequate moral psychology is to include analyses of concepts such as \u201caction,\u201d \u201cintention,\u201d and \u201cduty.\u201d These concepts are important in moral psychology because they are important in understanding how moral judgments influence behavior.\nAn explanation of how free will is possible is not included in Annis's list of components of an adequate moral psychology.

An obligation is an action that is morally or legally required of you. Obligations can be either agent-relative or agent-neutral.\nAn agent-relative obligation is an obligation that is dependent on the identity of the agent. This means that the specific person who has the obligation is relevant to the content of the obligation.\nAn agent-neutral obligation is an obligation that is independent of the identity of the agent. This means that the specific person who has the obligation is not relevant to the content of the obligation.\nParfit's theory is that the obligation to give priority to the welfare of one's children is an agent-relative obligation. This means that the specific parents who have the obligation are relevant to the content of the obligation.\nSo, the obligation to give priority to the welfare of one's children is agent-relative, not agent-neutral."}

He believed that the key to living a good life is to understand what is within our control and what is not.\nHe argued that we should focus our efforts on controlling our own thoughts and actions. We should not try to control things that are outside of our control, such as the thoughts and actions of other people.\nAccording to Epictetus, if we act according to our passions, we are acting outside of our control. Passionate desire can lead to anger, jealousy, and other negative emotions.\nIf we act so as to do whatever comes naturally, without much thought, we are also acting outside of our control. This kind of behavior can lead to impulsive and reckless actions.\nTo live according to Epictetus' philosophy, we need to be careful reflectors. We need to consider the consequences of our actions and make sure that they are in line with our values.\nIf we follow these recommendations, we will be more likely to act in ways that are within our control. This will help us to live a good life."}

He also argued that good and evil are not things, but rather modes of being. So, for Augustine, it is not that some things are good and others are not. Instead, all things are good.\nHowever, Augustine also believed that all created things are not unchangeably good. Instead, they are good up to a point. Evil enters the world through the choices of free creatures. So, for Augustalecture: All created things are good. But they are good up to a point. Evil enters the world through the choices of free creatures.\nSOLUTION: Look at the answer: C.\nAugustine believed that all created things are good.

The person can use the word \"circle\" because of their experience. But this is not the same as knowing the logos, or rational principle, of the circle. The logos of a circle is that it is a simple, closed figure. The person who knows this has a concept of a circle that goes beyond their own experience.\nAn opinion is different from knowledge because it is not based on the logos of the thing. An opinion instead is based on how a thing appears to a person.\nThe difference between knowledge and opinion is important. Knowledge can be more certain than opinion. For example, knowing that a certain food is a stimulant is more certain than opining that the food is a stimulant.\nThe difference between knowledge and opinion is also what is at the heart of the communal divide. The people in the cave who opine that the shadows are reality are distinguishing themselves from the people who have knowledge of the higher things."}

They can be used to make an argument by showing how one thing is similar to another thing that is easier to understand or agree on.\nCleanthes uses an analogy to make his case for the existence of God. He argues that just as the sun, which is a powerful and complex system, is the result of design, so too is the universe, which is also a powerful and complex system, the result of design.\nPhilo says that this analogy is strong. A strong analogy shows that there are many ways in which two things are similar. So, the fact that the sun and the universe are both complex and powerful systems is a reason to think that the universe is also the result of design."}

{"question": "Which of the following is not one of Ross\u2019s prima facie duties?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fidelity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Beneficence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Non-maleficence"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Legality"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, and fidelity are the cornerstones of medical ethics. They have been included in the tenets of the American Medical Association and the World Medical Association's International Code of Medical Ethics.\nThese principles help to guide physicians and other health care professionals in their decision-making. They clarify the standards of conduct and provide a framework for evaluating the ethical acceptability of different treatments and interventions.\nFidelity refers to the physician's obligation to adhere to the values and ethical standards of the profession. This includes maintaining patient confidentiality, obtaining informed consent, and avoiding conflicts of interest.\nBeneficence refers to the duty to act for the benefit of the patient. This means that physicians and other health care professionals must make decisions that promote the patient's well-being.\nNon-maleficence refers to the duty to do no harm. This means that physicians and other health care professionals must avoid taking actions that could cause harm to the patient.\nLegality refers to the duty to comply with the law. This includes following the rules and regulations that govern the practice of medicine.\nSOLUTION: Legality is not one of Ross's prima facie duties. Prima facie duties are the duties that arise in the first instance, before considering any other factors. They are obligations that a person has simply by being in a particular situation.\nLegality is a duty that arises after a court has ordered a medical procedure. It is not a duty that arises as a result of being a physician or a health care professional."}

This means that people are afraid to trust each other, because they do not know if the other person will try to harm them.\nHobbes believed that people would not behave in a civilized manner without a common power to keep them in line. In the absence of a common power, Hobbes thought that people would be in a state of war. War, to Hobbes, is a state of every man against every man."}

So, a rule can be for the good of human beings only if it does not harm anyone and does not impose unnecessary restrictions.\nA rule that promotes the good of some people is not necessarily not harmful or impose unnecessary restrictions.

According to Sartre, existence precedes essence in human beings. This means that people do not have an inherent nature or purpose. Instead, people create their own nature and purpose by the choices they make.\nSartre calls the being in whom existence precedes essence 'man.' This term is not meant to apply to any particular gender. Instead, it refers to all human beings."}

However, he also believes that God has given us reason and judgment, and that we are responsible for using these capacities to act virtuously. So, in order to act in accordance with our highest inward principle, we need to use our reason and judgment to determine what that principle is.\nButler does not believe that our reason and judgment are infallible. He recognizes that we may have different principles that we consider to be our highest inward principle, and that these principles may sometimes come into conflict with each other. So, in order to act in accordance with our highest inward principle, we need to do our best to determine what that principle is, and then act in accordance with it."}

Austin defines the concept of a performative utterance as an utterance whose performance causes something to happen. In other words, when a speaker performs a performative utterance, the utterance has the effect of making something true.\nAnscombe argues that intentionality is necessary for an action to have ethical significance. To have ethical significance, an action must be performed with a specific intention. This intention can include the intention to follow a rule, but it must include some intention to do something that is ethically significant.\nAnscombe criticizes Sidgwick on the grounds that Sidgwick does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one's action. According to Anscombe, it is essential to ethics that actions have ethical significance. To have ethical significance, an action must be performed with the intention of doing something that is ethically significant. This intention must include the intention to do something that you believe to be ethically significant.\nAnscombe does not claim that a distinction should not be drawn between intention and foresight. She claims that a distinction should be drawn between intention and foresight in the service of the distinction between actions that have ethical significance and actions that do not.\nAnscombe does not claim that a divine law conception of ethics is inherently misguided. She claims that a divine command theory is a type of ethical theory that is not based on intentional actions. According to Anscombe, an ethical theory is not based on intentional actions if it does not take into account the intentions of the person whose actions are being considered.\nAnscombe does not claim that the universe has a natural balance. She claims that the idea that the universe has a natural balance is a non-intentional notion. Non-intentional notions cannot provide a basis for ethics, according to Anscombe."}

According to Hobbes, the right of nature is the liberty to use one\u2019s powers to preserve one\u2019s life. This liberty is important to the extent that it helps individuals avoid the state of nature, which is a state of constant conflict and insecurity.\nHobbes argues that individuals have the right to do anything they think necessary to preserve their own lives. This right is part of the right of nature.\nThe other choices are not the right of nature according to Hobbes.\nThe right of the king to rule his subjects is not the right of nature. It is a social contract.\nAn entitlement to the fruits of one's labors is not the right of nature. It is a result of the right of property.\nA claim not to be harmed by others is the right to be free from harm.

If we limit our perspective to an internal dreamworld, we cannot achieve any objective, external knowledge of the real world.\nWe know whether our internal perspective is correct only by comparing it with an objective, external perspective on the world. This applies to both perception and evaluation.\nWhether we are perceiving or evaluating, we use different types of standards to determine what we perceive or what we think is true.\nOur perceptions are true if they are similar to the facts. Our thoughts are true if they are justified.\nTo determine whether our perceptions are similar to the facts, we need to compare them with the facts.\nTo determine whether our thoughts are justified, we need to compare them with the rest of our beliefs and with the facts.\nEvaluating the usefulness, truth, or value of our perspective involves comparing it with a standard.\nIf our goal is to achieve objectively true beliefs, then the standard we use to evaluate our perspective is the set of objective, external facts.\nOtherwise, the standard we use to evaluate our perspective may be different.\nFor example, if our goal is to maximize our own happiness, then the standard we use to evaluate our perspective may be whether it leads to more happiness for us."}

One research question might be: Does the new medicine decrease the number of days with migraines? To answer this question, the investigator could do the following:\nChoice \"In-depth interviewing\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Covert observation\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Structured interviewing\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"Qualitative content analysis\" is incorrect.\nThe investigator could design a study with two groups: one group of patients who take the new medicine and another who do not. The investigator could track the number of days with migraines for each group and compare the results.\nChoice \"Qualitative content analysis\" is incorrect.\nQualitative content analysis is a research method that involves analyzing written or printed text.

{"question": "Craig argues that the series of events in time cannot be actually infinite, so we know that _____.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the universe is finite in the past and began to exist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the universe is infinite in the past"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the universe never is uncaused"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the universe exists only in the mind"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Causation is a concept that is used to explain how one event can cause another event to happen. Many philosophers have argued that causation requires a chain of events that stretches back in time. This means that an event cannot cause another event if there is no other event that happened before it in time.\nSome philosophers have also argued that there must be a first event in the chain of events that link two events together. This first event is often called the cause of the second event. If there is no first event in the chain of events, then the second event does not have a cause.\nThese ideas about causation and the relationship between events in time are important when we are discussing the origin of the universe. If the universe has a cause, then that cause must be an event that is part of the chain of events that stretches back in time. But if the universe is infinite in the past, then there is no first event in this chain of events. So, the universe cannot have a cause.\nIf the universe is finite in the past, then the chain of events that links the cause to the effect is finite. This means that the cause must be an event that is part of the chain of events that stretches back in time. So, the universe has a cause.\nIf the universe never is uncaused, then there is a chain of events that links the cause to the effect. This chain of events must stretch back in time. So, the universe has a cause.\nIf the universe exists only in the mind, then the universe does not have a cause. The idea that the universe exists only in the mind is called idealism. But idealism is not a common view. Most people believe that the universe is not only in their mind, but is also an objective reality.\nSOLUTION: Craig argues that the series of events in time cannot be actually infinite, so we know that the universe is finite in the past and began to exist. The first sentence of the passage states this directly: \"The argument hinges on the idea that an actual infinite cannot exist in the past.\" The rest of the passage explains why this means that the universe began to exist."}

The desire, then, of the thing is called pleasure. Operation, on the other hand, is that which is done by something. The operation of a thing is called its function. So it is that the existence of a thing is called its purpose.\"\nThe passage is talking about the relationship between pleasure, operation, and existence. According to Aquinas, pleasure exists for the sake of operation, and operation exists for the sake of pleasure. This means that the purpose of something is to perform an operation, and the purpose of experiencing pleasure is to help that thing perform its operation."}

A duty or an obligation is something that you have an obligation to do, and that obligation is owed to someone.\nOne of the key points in Anscombe's paper is that the concept of a duty or an obligation is not derived from the concept of a preference. A preference is a matter of what you like or want. The fact that you prefer something does not imply that it is your duty to do it.\nA duty or an obligation is also not derived from the concept of maximizing utility. Utility is a measure of the satisfaction or disappointment that you get from something. But the fact that an action would maximize utility does not imply that it is your duty to do it.\nA duty or an obligation is also not derived from the concept of a positive law. A positive law is a law that is enacted by a government. But the fact that a law exists does not imply that it is your duty to follow it.\nA duty or an obligation is also not derived from the concept of a divine law. A divine law is a law that is given by a god. But the fact that a law is given by a god does not imply that it is your duty to follow it."}

This morality requires that people be concerned for the interests of others because it is in their self-interest to do so. However, this morality also requires that people be concerned for the interests of others independently of their self-interest.\nSo, the morality that Gauthier describes as facing a foundational crisis involves enlightened egoism and a concern for the interests of others. It does not involve pure altruism, which is motivated by a concern for the interests of others without any concern for oneself. It also does not involve justified constraint, which is based on the idea that people are motivated by a sense of duty or obligation to act in certain ways. And it does not involve prima facie duties, which are duties that are binding until they are outweighed by other considerations."}
{"question": "In spite of the fact that Socrates claims to be ignorant of the essence or nature of certain things like justice, he is wise insofar as he recognizes that without such knowledge actions are rationally unjustified.

It tells you what Socrates' wisdom consists of.\nSocrates is wise because he recognizes that without knowledge of the essences of things, actions are rationally unjustified. His wisdom consists in his recognition not only that he is ignorant of such essences but also that: to know what is just, we must know the essence of justice.\nJustice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.\nHe knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.\nHe does not claim to have knowledge of the essences of things. Instead, he claims to be looking for them.\nKnowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.\nHis method of asking questions is a way of helping people to examine their beliefs about the essences of things."}

Prudence is not solely about matters of desire, pleasure, piety, or fame. It is concerned with right judgment about what is best to do in a particular situation, and this involves evaluating the morally good choices."}
{"question": "According to Locke, a man in the state of nature will relinquish his absolute freedom to the state because _____.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "he will also enjoy absolute freedom when subject to the state"}, {"label": "B", "text": "in the state of nature the enjoyment of his freedom is very uncertain and vulnerable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "he wants to have absolute power over others"}, {"label": "D", "text": "he rejects the laws of the state of nature"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: This is a question about the social contract. The social contract is an agreement between rulers and ruled. According to Locke, the rulers get the power to rule by getting the consent of the ruled.\nThe question asks you to determine why someone would consent to give up their freedom to a state. The right answer is B. In the state of nature, Locke argues that the enjoyment of your freedom is very uncertain and vulnerable. You might be free to do something, but that freedom could be taken away by someone else. This could be dangerous and uncertain. So, people give up some freedom to a state to have a more certain and secure amount of freedom."}

According to Ross, justice is when the guilty are punished for their crimes.\nJustice is punishment for wrongdoing, not for being unhappy or for breaking a contract. If you're not punished for breaking a contract, then justice is not served. If you're punished for being unhappy, that's not justice."}

This means that mental states do cause behavior, but according to logical behaviorism, they do not cause any other mental states.\nThis theory is at odds with our commonsense intuition that mental states can also include things like beliefs, desires, and feelings.

Some find moral answers by proving them philosophically. But that is not how Ross finds our prima facie duties.\nRoss believes that we can see what our prima facie duties are by looking at particular acts. We can see what we have a prima facie duty to do by looking at what would be right if we saw the act in question from the perspective of the moral rules. We can then apprehend the general duty that is revealed by these particular acts.\nSo, we learn of our prima facie duties by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles."}

These theories explain why certain actions are right or wrong.\nMoral theories can also help to resolve moral conflicts. This is because moral theories can provide a common set of principles to guide decision-making.\nMoral theories can be based on a variety of things. They may be based on religion, philosophy, or personal preference. Some moral theories are based on the idea that actions are right if they promote the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Others are based on the idea that actions are right if they follow natural law.\nSOLUTION: Look at the explanations for each answer choice.\nA moral theory explains why an action is right or wrong.\nA moral theory can also explain why one moral event caused another. But this is not the only thing that a moral theory can explain.\nA moral theory can also explain why people do what they do. But this is not the main thing that a moral theory explains.\nA moral theory explains where a moral agent got her values. But a moral theory can also explain why those values are correct."}

{"question": "To argue that he is obliged to obey the laws of Athens, Socrates compares the city to:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "an employer."}, {"label": "B", "text": "a parent."}, {"label": "C", "text": "a friend."}, {"label": "D", "text": "a spouse."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Socrates compares the city to a parent in the passage. He says that a parent who abandons or mistreats their child is not to be obeyed. He argues that the city of Athens is like a parent who has nurtured and cared for him. Therefore, if the city asks him to do something wrong, he will not obey."}

Soft determinism does not entail that we are free to choose our desires. It does not entail that there are no restraints on human behavior. It does not entail that the thesis of determinism is false. And it does not entail that the thesis of determinism is true."}
{"question": "In the moral life, feelings are _____.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "essential and inevitable"}, {"label": "B", "text": "essential to impartiality"}, {"label": "C", "text": "an unerring guide"}, {"label": "D", "text": "reason based"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Feelings are important to moral judgments, but they are not an unerring guide. This means that feelings can be a factor in moral judgments, but they do not always determine the moral rightness or wrongness of an action.\nMoral judgments are also based on reason. Reason can help you determine the moral rightness or wrongness of an action."}

Whether a moral code is ideal, or the best possible set of rules, depends in part on the costs of its restrictions. The costs of a set of restrictions include the effect that the restrictions have on the people who follow the moral code.\nOne of the costs of a set of restrictions is the guilt that it induces. Guilt is a psychological cost, and it can be harmful. So, one of the things that Brandt thinks matters for whether a moral code is ideal is the costs of its restrictions, in terms of the guilt it induces."}
{"question": "The view that we consist of two distinct substances (body and mind) and that these two interact is known as _____.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "functionalism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "identity theory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "substance dualism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "materialism"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Substance dualism is the view that we consist of two distinct substances (body and mind) and that these two interact. This is the opposite of materialism, which is the view that we are purely physical beings and that the mind arises from the body."}
{"question": "According to Stevenson, the word \u201cgood\u201d has a pleasing emotive meaning that fits it for:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "descriptive use."}, {"label": "B", "text": "constructive use."}, {"label": "C", "text": "dynamic use."}, {"label": "D", "text": "propositional use."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The value of a word is called its use. The use of a word includes the ways in which it is used to describe, discuss, or analyze ideas, objects, or topics.\nThe dynamic use of a word is its use in explaining how things change. The propositional use of a word is its use in propositions, or sentences that express claims. The descriptive use of a word is its use in describing things. The constructive use of a word is its use in constructing objects or structures.\nSOLUTION: Stevenson's paragraph uses the word \"good\" in the descriptive sense. The word \"good\" is used to describe something as having a pleasing emotive meaning."}

In order to make claims about what other people ought to do, you need to have a theory of what it means to say that someone ought to do something.\nOne thing that a theory of ought must do is tell you what kind of reasoning is relevant to determining what people ought to do. In other words, it must tell you what facts about a case are relevant to deciding what people ought to do.\nOne of the key questions in the theory of ethics is what kinds of facts are relevant to moral judgments. Some theorists argue that moral judgments are based on facts about the case alone. Other theorists argue that moral judgments are based on facts about the case, plus the moral inclinations of the people involved.\nStill, others argue that moral judgments are based on facts about the case, plus the moral opinions of the people involved.\nIf the latter two theories are correct, then people can disagree about what someone ought to do even if they agree about the facts of the case. This is because their differing moral inclinations, or moral opinions, would lead them to different conclusions.\nIf the theory that says moral judgments are based on facts about the case alone is correct, then people will not disagree about what someone ought to do if they agree about the facts of the case. This is because their different moral inclinations, or moral opinions, would not matter if the only facts that are relevant to moral judgments are facts about the case."}
{"question": "To explain the notion of a prima facie duty, Ross draws an analogy with:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "natural laws."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the laws of a nation."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the commands of a dictator."}, {"label": "D", "text": "our emotions."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: A duty is a concept from ethics. To have a duty to do something is to have a moral obligation to do it. Ross believes that we often have a duty to act in ways that promote the happiness of other people. He draws an analogy in order to explain what he means by a duty.\nAn analogy is a comparison that highlights similarities between two things. An analogy can be helpful in explaining a concept by showing how it is similar to a familiar concept.\nHere is the analogy:\nA duty is like a bill of goods. A bill of goods is a phrase for a situation in which you are sold something that is not what you thought you were buying. A duty is not what you thought you were buying when you were born. But just as a bill of goods is not what you thought you were buying, a duty is not what you thought you were signing up for when you were born.\nA duty is also like a gift. A gift is something that is given to you. Often, a gift is not something that you would have chosen for yourself. But you are glad to have the gift anyway. A duty is not something that you would have chosen for yourself. But you are glad to have the duty anyway.\nA duty is not like a command. A command is a order to do something. A command from a dictator is not binding. You are not required to follow a command from a dictator.\nA duty is also not like our emotions. Our emotions are not moral judgments. Our emotions are not based on moral principles."}

Thrasymachus is a character in the Republic who claims that justice is \"the advantage of the stronger.\" This means that he believes that justice is whatever the powerful want it to be.\nThis idea is controversial. Some people believe that justice is objective\u2014that is, it exists independently of what people think about it. These people believe that justice is based on values that are timeless and universal.\nOther people believe that justice is subjective\u2014that is, it depends on the opinions of individuals. These people believe that justice is a matter of personal preference."}

He believed that love is a force that can transform the human soul. According to Epictetus, genuine love is not concerned with the duration of life, but with the quality of it. He argued that the desire for one's loved ones to live forever is a sign of a self-centered love, not a genuine love.\nHe also recognized that this desire is a natural instinct, but he argued that it is a symptom of a lack of understanding of the nature of love. In his view, this desire is blasphemous, because it is to assume that one's love can extend beyond the limits of one's own life."}

Its first principle is that man is nothing, which means that humans do not have any inherent meaning or purpose.\nSOLUTION: Look at the four choices.\nGod is dead is not the first principle of existentialism.\nMan is all-powerful is not the first principle of existentialism.\nMan is nothing else but what he makes of himself is the first principle of existentialism.\nMan is nothing is the first principle of existentialism."}

It does not specify what specific choices are in our power or not in our power. So, the opposite of this claim is not presented in the passage.\nThe claim that virtue is in our power, and so is vice, is not presented in the passage. The passage does not discuss whether vice is in our power.\nThe passage does present the claim that virtue is in our power, but vice is not. This opposite claim is presented in the passage.\nThe passage does not discuss whether neither virtue nor vice is in our power."}
{"question": "Hume describes reason as:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "cool and disengaged."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the source of all moral actions."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the first spring or impulse to desire."}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Hume says that reason is the first spring or impulse to desire. This means that reason can give us ideas of things that we may want, and can help us to decide what to do. But according to Hume, reason alone cannot cause us to act.\nHe also says that reason is the slave of the passions. This means that reason can be strongest when we are motivated by our passions. In other words, our desires can help reason to figure out what we want.\nHume does not say that reason is cool and disengaged.\nHe does not say that reason is the source of all moral actions."}
{"question": "According to Brandt, John Stuart Mill\u2019s view most closely resembles:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "act-utilitarianism."}, {"label": "B", "text": "a rule-utilitarianism based on the actual rules of society."}, {"label": "C", "text": "a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kant\u2019s ethics."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Rule-utilitarianism is the view that the rules of a society should be made to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number. This view is based on the idea that people's actions are right if they follow the rules that would promote the greatest happiness.\nMill's utilitarianism is a form of act-utilitarianism, which is the view that whether an action is right is determined by how much happiness it produces. So, Mill's view is most similar to act-utilitarianism."}

He is suggesting that hypothetical knowledge, or reasoning from observed similarities and differences, cannot provide the foundation for dialectical knowledge.\nA hypothesis is a provisional assumption used as a starting point for further investigation. In contrast, dialectic aims to reach the first principles, or the ultimate underlying facts, through a series of logical steps.\nExamples of hypothetical knowledge include:\nDescribing the color, texture, and taste of a fruit.\nExplaining why a friend is late based on traffic conditions.\nAssistant: These examples use observations to make predictions or explain events.

Philosophers use logic to come up with arguments to answer these questions.\nMetaphysics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the most basic questions about existence. These questions include: What is the nature of reality? What is the difference between mind and body?\nEpistemology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of knowledge. These questions include: How do you know what you know? How do you find out what is true?\nAxiology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the study of ethics and value. These questions include: What is the right thing to do? What is the value of a human life?\nLogic is the science of good reasoning.

The degree to which one acts compassionately depends on the balance between these two sets of motivations.\nOther affections besides compassion can include motivations such as self-interest, personal gain, or even a sense of duty. These motivations can come into conflict with compassion. For example, self-interest might lead someone to act in a way that is not compassionate."}

These consequences can make it harder for the person to do what is required by the constitution.\nA person who is by nature envious and ungenerous does not have constitutional moral luck. This is because being envious and ungenerous are not actions. They are traits of character.\nA person who lived in Nazi Germany in 1940 does have constitutional moral luck. This is because the actions of the Nazi government made it hard for people to live up to the constitution.\nA person who drives drunk and hits a child does have constitutional moral luck. This is because the consequences of driving drunk are beyond the person's control.\nAll of the above have constitutional moral luck."}

He claims that these two principles can be known empirically. He then uses these two principles to derive the principle of utility.\nSo, Mill claims that the principle of utility can be proven from principles that are known empirically."}

Butler believes that conscience is the inner voice of the soul, which is directed by the moral sense. The moral sense is informed by the principles of religion, and it is through the use of reason that the principles of religion are applied to specific situations. So, to follow nature is to act on one's conscience, which is guided by the moral sense and the principles of religion.\nAccording to Butler, to act on one's passions is to act in a non-rational way. To act on one's strongest passion would be to give into one's lowest and most base desires. This would be acting in a non-rational way, and would not be following nature.\nActing as one pleases is also acting in a non-rational way. If one is following their desires instead of their conscience, they are not following nature."}

Other aesthetic values are more particular to specific individuals or cultures.\nSOLUTION: Look at the choices.\nAesthetic values have to do with the moral value of works of art and other objects that could be judged beautiful. This choice is incorrect.\nAesthetic values are not necessarily about good and bad works of art. They are about the ways in which works of art and other objects can be judged beautiful.\nThe moral values of artists and critics have to do with the characters of the people who create and evaluate works of art.
