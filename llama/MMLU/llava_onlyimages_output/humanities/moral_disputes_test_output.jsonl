Jus in bello deals with the ethics of war, and the principle of military necessity is one of its rules.\nJus ad bellum, or the laws of war, deal with the ethics of going to war. They define the conditions under which war is justified. The principle of military necessity does not belong to jus ad bellum.\nMoral nihilism is the belief that there is no morality, that it is not true that any action is right or wrong. Such a view would not consider the principle of military necessity to be part of a set of rules for the conduct of war.\nAll of the above. Jus in bello is the branch of just war theory that deals with the conduct of war. It is concerned with the rules that govern the use of military force. The principle of military necessity is one of its rules. So, the principle of military necessity belongs to jus in bello."}
{"question": " According to Mill, censoring speech that is possibly true", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "violates human dignity."}, {"label": "B", "text": "fails a prima facie duty of honesty."}, {"label": "C", "text": "is tantamount to asserting that you are infallible."}, {"label": "D", "text": "is a risk worth taking of the speech is dangerous enough."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Mill argued that free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. One of the reasons he gave for this is that censoring speech can prevent the truth from coming out.\nAccording to Mill, censoring speech that is possibly true is a violation of human dignity. It treats people as if they are too foolish to be able to handle the truth. This, in turn, violates their human dignity.\nCensoring speech that is possibly true also fails a prima facie duty of honesty. A prima facie duty of honesty is a duty to always tell the truth. By censoring speech that is possibly true, you are not fulfilling this duty.\nCensoring speech that is possibly true is also tantamount to asserting that you are infallible. If you are censoring speech, you are claiming that you know what is true and what is not. This is a tall claim.\nFinally, Mill did not think that the fact that a speech is dangerous was a reason to censor it. He believed that the value of a truthful speech is not determined by the harm that it might cause. The harm caused by a speech is one of the eight headings under which harm can be classified. The others include the harm to people's livelihoods, the harm to their relationships, and so on.\nThus, according to Mill, censoring speech that is possibly true is a violation of human dignity, fails a prima facie duty of honesty, is tantamount to asserting that you are infallible, and is not a risk worth taking if the speech is dangerous enough. The last three reasons support the first reason: if censoring speech is wrong for those reasons, it is also wrong because it violates human dignity."}

An analogy can be used to compare a situation to something else that is known to be true or to draw a conclusion from an example.\nBe careful when using analogy to argue. The analogy may not be perfect.

Another important feature is that their effects are also felt worldwide. As a result, the institutions that are in place to address these problems are often inadequate.\nGardiner defines an environmental problem as a issue that is caused by human activities and has negative effects on the environment. He defines an institution as the set of formal and informal rules that govern how individuals or groups interact. Institutional adequacy refers to whether the institutions that are in place are appropriate for the problem at hand.\nSOLUTION: Read the passage carefully. It discusses the characteristics of global environmental problems.\nOne of the major features of global environmental problems is that they are caused by human activities that take place across the world. Another important feature is that their effects are also felt worldwide. As a result, the institutions that are in place to address these problems are often inadequate.\nInstitutions are designed to deal with problems that are caused by people following their self-interest. Environmental problems are often caused by people not following their self-interest. They are often caused by people not taking into account the negative effects of their actions on others.\nThis means that the institutions that are in place to address these problems are often not well-suited to the task. For example, the rules that govern the use of the world's oceans were developed by nations and are enforced by their coast guards. But nations have incentives to overexploit the oceans. So, the rules are not enforced well.\nAnother example is the international trade in endangered species. The rules that govern this trade were developed to prevent the extinction of species. But these rules are not well-designed to prevent the trade in species that are not yet extinct but are on their way to becoming so.\nAs a result of these and other problems, the rules that govern the use of the world's resources are often not well-designed to protect the environment. This leads to a problem of institutional adequacy."}

This approach is based on the idea that people deserve punishment for their crimes, and that punishment is necessary to maintain social order.\nPreventive theories of punishment, by contrast, aim to prevent people from committing crimes in the future. This approach is based on the idea that people can be deterred from committing crimes by the threat of punishment.\nBoth retributive and preventive theories of punishment can be justified by consequentialist reasoning. That is, one can argue that these approaches to punishment lead to good consequences.\nHowever, legal theories of punishment are not concerned with the consequences of punishment. Instead, legal theories focus on the principles that should guide the punishment of individuals. These principles include the ideas of fairness, justice, and equality.\nPerfectionist theories of punishment are also not concerned with the consequences of punishment. Instead, perfectionist theories focus on the idea that punishment should be used to reform individuals and promote their moral growth."}

One ground is that cloning constitutes unethical experimentation. Experimentation on humans is always ethically suspect, and experimentation on cloned humans is no different. But cloning humans is not the same as cloning sheep. Sheep are not persons.\nAnother ground is that cloning threatens identity and individuality. Each person has a unique identity and individuality. Cloning would threaten this.\nA third ground is that cloning will produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones. This is not an objection that Kass makes. It is a fact that cloning will produce harmful mutations. But this is not a reason to ban cloning. It is a reason to ban the creation of human clones.\nThe last ground is that cloning perverts our values concerning parenthood and the raising of children. The values that would be perverted are those that regard parenthood and child-rearing as sacred. But these values are not shared by everyone. And they are not values that anyone would identify as essential to a good life."}

Reiman disagrees with this argument and instead argues that the death penalty is a form of revenge, not justice.\nReiman also argues that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to murder. Therefore, the refusal to execute criminals has a civilizing effect.\nDeath by torture is a form of cruel and unusual punishment and is therefore unconstitutional.\nMurder is wrong.

{"question": " According to Singer, the principle of equality requires", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "identical treatment."}, {"label": "B", "text": "differential treatment."}, {"label": "C", "text": "equal consideration."}, {"label": "D", "text": "differential consideration."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The principle of equality requires that people be treated equally. This means that people should be given equal consideration when it comes to matters of social justice.\nEqual consideration does not mean that everyone willreceive the same treatment. Rather, it means that the needs and interests of different individuals will be taken into account when decisions are made. For example, a policy that benefits one group of people may not be the best policy for everyone. So, equal consideration requires that the needs and interests of all groups be taken into account when a policy is being developed.\nDifferential treatment, on the other hand, means that people are given different treatment based on their status. For example, a policy that gives preferential treatment to a certain group of people is an example of differential treatment."}

Virtue ethics is an important development of moral principles that has moved beyond the rightness and wrongness of actions to include the rightness or wrongness of character. But care ethics goes further than virtue ethics in emphasizing the importance of relationships and the caring role of the moral agent. So, care ethics is an important development of virtue ethics."}

Therefore, any attempt to justify the claim that humans have a higher moral status than other animals by appealing to some version of rationality as the morally relevant difference between humans and animals will fail to give an adequate answer to the argument from marginal cases.\nIn order to make the case that rationality is morally relevant to the status of animals as moral patients as opposed to their status as moral agents, a theorist would need to do more than simply assert that rationality is the morally relevant difference between humans and animals. They would need to argue that being rational is what makes animals as moral patients."}

Fine recognizes that there are limits to how clearly these rules can be distinguished from one another. So, he uses the example of a yoga group that practices in Central Park to show that there are rules about how a group can exclude people from its activities, and there are rules about how people can exclude each other from a territory.\nRules of membership relate to how a group chooses its own members. Rules about settlement within a territory relate to how individuals who are not part of a group are allowed to use the territory. So, rules of membership and rules about settlement within a territory can differ.\nIn the example, the yoga group is free to reject prospective members.

{"question": " The annual death-toll from poverty related causes is, according to Pogge,", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "around one quarter of all human deaths."}, {"label": "B", "text": "around one third of all human deaths."}, {"label": "C", "text": "around one half of all human deaths."}, {"label": "D", "text": "none of the above."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Pogge argues that poverty is the primary cause of premature death. A significant proportion of global poverty is found in developing countries. According to the MIT article, poverty is the lack of access to the resources necessary for a human being to live a healthy, happy life. These resources include food, water, sanitation, shelter, and health care. Developing countries have a hard time providing these resources to their citizens.\nThe World Health Organization estimates that of the 57 million deaths each year, about 36 million are related to poverty. One-third of all human deaths is around 24 million. So, around one-third of all human deaths is a better description of the data."}
{"question": " What is the overall percentage of capital cases that are overturned because of serious errors?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "under 50 percent"}, {"label": "B", "text": "52 percent"}, {"label": "C", "text": "68 percent"}, {"label": "D", "text": "82 percent"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: There are many ways to overcome a death sentence. One of the most common ways is to show that the trial was seriously flawed. Over the past 50 years, more than 140 death row inmates have been released from death row because they were found to have been convicted of a crime they did not commit.\nMany of these inmates were found to have been convicted based on evidence that was later found to be false or misleading. For example, some inmates were convicted based on the testimony of jailhouse informants who were paid to testify against the inmate.\nMoreover, some of these inmates were convicted based on evidence that was later found to have been planted or fabricated.\nIn other cases, inmates were convicted based on the testimony of experts who later admitted that their testimony was false.\nIn still other cases, inmates were convicted based on trial errors that were so serious that they violated the inmate's right to a fair trial.\nThe American Bar Association estimated that in 1995, 18% of death row inmates were actually innocent.\nIf we assume that the death penalty is applied randomly, then about 1% of all capital cases are overturned because of serious errors.\nIf we use the ABA's estimate that 18% of death row inmates are actually innocent, then about 18% of all capital cases are overturned because of serious errors.\nIf we use the ABA's estimate and assume that the death penalty is applied randomly, then about 82% of capital cases that are overturned because of serious errors are overturned because the inmate was actually innocent.\nThe other 18% are overturned because of errors that did not affect the inmate's guilt or innocence."}

{"question": " In Corvino's reading of Aquinas, \"unnatural\" sexual acts are those that are", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "deliberately pro-creative."}, {"label": "B", "text": "non-consensual."}, {"label": "C", "text": "deliberately non-procreative."}, {"label": "D", "text": "uncommonly practiced among adults."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Corvino argues that for Aquinas, the key to determining whether a sexual act is immoral is to figure out what the act does. If the act is deliberately procreative, then it is not immoral; if it is not deliberately procreative, then it is.\nCorvino notes that Aquinas allows for some exceptions to this rule. An act that is not deliberately procreative may not be immoral if either the partners use contraceptives to prevent procreation, or the couple has good reason to believe that the woman is infertile.\nHowever, Corvino claims that non-procreative sex can be immoral if it is chosen for the wrong reason. If a couple has sex only to relieve boredom, for example, they are treating sex as a mere pleasure. For Aquinas, this is not a good enough reason for having sex.\nCorvino also argues that Aquinas would not consider non-procreative sex to be intrinsically evil. Instead, he claims that non-procreative sex is not immoral simply because it is non-procreative.\nSOLUTION: Look at the passage. It discusses what makes a sexual act unnatural for Aquinas.\nAccording to Corvino, Aquinas believes that non-procreative sex is not immoral simply because it is non-procreative. So, a sexual act that is deliberately non-procreative would not be considered unnatural by Aquinas."}

He does this to answer the question of whether killing is morally worse than letting die.\nRachels argues that killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die. He contends that whether the outcome is killing or letting die affects how bad the outcome is, but does not affect whether the outcome is morally worse than the other.\nJones's case shows that letting die can have worse consequences than killing. In Jones's case, the outcome is that the boy dies. Whether this outcome is called letting die or killing does not affect how bad it is. So, letting die is not in itself morally worse than killing.\nSOLUTION: To let die is to refuse to do something that would keep someone alive. Killing is the opposite of letting die. So, to decide whether letting die is in itself morally worse than killing, consider which outcome is better.\nJones's case shows that letting die can have worse consequences than killing. In Jones's case, the outcome is that the boy dies. Whether this outcome is called letting die or killing does not affect how bad it is. So, letting die is not in itself morally worse than killing."}

Ethical theories have different views on what entities have direct moral standing.\nThis means that there are different types of theories. Some theories, for example, hold that the only beings that have direct moral standing are human beings. Other theories, by contrast, hold that all and only sentient creatures have direct moral standing.\nA living being is an organism that is alive. So, all living beings, because they are living, possess direct moral standing.\nAn ecosystem is formed when living beings interact in an environment. So, ecosystems cannot be the primary bearers of direct moral standing. Instead, the living beings that make up an ecosystem have direct moral standing."}

It is a consideration of what the agent could have done instead of what the agent did do.\nMany consequentialist theories also hold that an action is right if and only if it is the action that would produce the best consequences.\nStrongly impartialist moral theories hold that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on whether the action would be justifiable for all persons affected by it.\nThese theories are similar to impartialist theories, but they do not allow for any exceptions.\nThey hold that the same actions are right or wrong for all persons in the same circumstances."}

Neglecting to take steps toward self-sustenance does not directly injure a person's sense of autonomy. Dominating a partner and actually coercing them are forms of mistreatment that can injure a person's sense of autonomy.

{"question": " According to Huemer, even if drug use harms a person's friends, families, and other relations,", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "this would still not justify drug prohibition."}, {"label": "B", "text": "this would justify drug prohibition."}, {"label": "C", "text": "this would only justify drug prohibition if drug use was extremely likely to cause these harms."}, {"label": "D", "text": "this would only justify drug prohibition if drug use was more likely to cause these kinds of harms than other prohibited activity."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Huemer believes that if a person's actions harm their friends, families, and other relations, this would be a reason to prohibit those actions. This principle applies to drug use as well. So, if drug use is likely to harm a person's friends, families, and other relations, this would justify drug prohibition.\nHowever, the extent to which this principle applies depends on the likelihood of harm. Huemer believes that if the harm is extremely likely to occur, this would justify prohibition. But if the harm is only more likely to occur than many other kinds of harm that are already prohibited, this would not justify prohibition."}
{"question": " The basic idea of social contract theories of morality is that correct or justified moral rules or principles are the ones that result from", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "a social leader's moral deliberations."}, {"label": "B", "text": "an actual or hypothetical social agreement of some sort."}, {"label": "C", "text": "a contract that has been signed by most of the affected parties."}, {"label": "D", "text": "none of the above"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Social contract theories of morality use the idea of a contract as a way to explain how moral rules and principles can be justified. According to this idea, a group of people agree to follow certain moral rules, and the rules are then justified because people have agreed to them.\nAn actual or hypothetical social agreement of some sort is one way that a contract can come into existence. Such an agreement may have led to the development of moral rules.\nA contract that has been signed by most of the affected parties is one example of an agreement that could serve as the basis for a social contract.\nA social leader's moral deliberations may have led to the development of moral rules, but they do not directly result from a social contract.\nNone of the above answers are correct."}

He believes that the desire to spare animals is a natural feeling, but that it is not an absolute.\nSinger believes that the principle of the equality of all beings applies to animals as well as to humans. He thinks that if it is wrong to kill a human being painlessly, then it is also wrong to kill an animal painlessly. But he believes that we cannot say precisely where to draw the line."}

She does this by contending that drug prohibition is done for the benefit of others, not the benefit of those who wish to produce or sell drugs.\nIt is not clear that this response succeeds. After all, many people argue that drug prohibition is not in fact for the benefit of others. They argue that it is not effective at achving its stated goals (e.g., reducing drug use), and that it has a range of negative consequences (e.g., increasing the power of criminal organizations).\nIf de Marneffe wants to argue that drug prohibition is not paternalistic, she needs to do more than simply assert that it is done for the benefit of others. She needs to show that it is."}

It does not discuss global poverty, the scope of which is vast and complex. It does not discuss how to balance addressing immediate harm and addressing structural injustice, which is a difficult but separate issue. It does not discuss how to reconcile different moral theories, which is a philosophical issue. It does not discuss the personal sacrifices that people might need to make in order to live up to Singer's arguments, which is a separate issue.

It asks how Ashford supports her thesis. Then, look at each answer choice.\nAid to the world's poor is not the thesis. The thesis is global social institutions violate the rights of the world's poor. The fact that aid to the world's poor exceeds illicit cash flow to tax havens from rich countries does not violate the rights of the world's poor. So, the thesis is not supported by this answer.\nMixed and at worse adverse impacts on the economic and social rights of the world's poor are not the same as violating the rights of the world's poor. So, this answer does not support the thesis.\nThis answer is correct. Pressuring poor countries to comply with neoliberal policies has had mixed and at worse adverse impacts on the economic and social rights of the world's poor, which supports Ashford's thesis that global social institutions violate the rights of the world's poor.\nAll of the above does not make a difference.

This approach would not directly address the overall intrinsic value brought about by abortion.\nA consequentialist theory approach to the morality of abortion would consider the overall intrinsic value brought about by abortion. This approach would evaluate the specific outcome of an abortion and compare it to other possible outcomes.\nA Kantian ethics approach to the morality of abortion would focus on the principles that should guide our actions, even if following those principles sometimes leads to bad outcomes. These principles include treating people as ends in themselves, not just as means to ends. This approach would consider the overall intrinsic value brought about by abortion.\nA natural law theory approach to the morality of abortion would consider the morality of an action based on the action's adherence to the laws of nature. This approach would focus on the fact that abortion is the deliberate termination of a human life, and the intrinsic value that each human life has. This approach would therefore consider the overall intrinsic value brought about by abortion."}

Surveys and longitudinal studies can both be used to identify patterns of behavior.\nLongitudinal studies observe individuals over time to see how their behavior changes. Surveys can ask individuals to report on their own behavior.\nShapiro claims that surveys have been confirmed by longitudinal studies. This means that the surveys identified a pattern of behavior that was also observed in the longitudinal studies.\nThe pattern identified in the surveys and confirmed by the longitudinal studies shows that moderate and/or controlled use of illegal drugs is the norm.

Nathanson argues that some crimes are more morally reprehensible than others, and that the punishment should reflect this difference in severity.\nNathanson also argues that an \"eye for an eye\" is an inadequate measure of moral desert. His argument is that the principle of equality does not provide an adequate measure of moral desert. Nathanson believes that some people deserve more punishment than others, and that the punishment should reflect this difference in desert.\nPunishing criminals in ways that are morally unacceptable is a problem for Kant's principle of equality and an \"eye for an eye.\" According to Nathanson, the principle of equality requires that we punish criminals in ways that are morally unacceptable. For example, the principle of equality would require us to punish a minor crime with the same severity as a major crime. This is an unacceptable punishment for a major crime, according to Nathanson.\nIt fails to tell us what the appropriate punishment would be for all cases of criminal action. is incorrect. The principle of equality tells us that the appropriate punishment for a crime is the same for all people.\nIt does not provide an adequate measure of moral desert. is incorrect.

In Rescue I, the man had good intentions. In Rescue II, the man had evil intentions.\nThe fact that the man had evil intentions does not mean that he necessarily originated a harmful sequence. As described in the case, the man had evil intentions when he started the car. But he then allowed a harmful sequence to occur."}

The Confucian model holds that individuals have a moral responsibility to act in accordance with a standard of conduct that is accepted by society. This model does not use the threat of punishment to change people's behavior. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of education and the spread of cultural values."}

It provides a basis for evaluating each statement.\nThe passage explains that Leopold believes that history has shown that being a conqueror is self-defeating. He gives three reasons: (1) the conquered people will fight back; (2) the conquerors will eventually have to rule a larger area than they really want; and (3) the conquerors will have to take on the difficult and expensive task of restoring the natural community within the area they have conquered.\nChoice \"the conqueror doesn't understand what makes the conquered community tick.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"the conqueror doesn't know what and who within the community is valuable.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"the conqueror doesn't know what and who is worthless in community life.\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"all of the above\" is incorrect.\nChoice \"D. \" is incorrect.\nChoice \"A. \" is incorrect.\nChoice \"B. \" is incorrect.\nChoice \"C. \" is incorrect."}

{"question": " Shapiro discusses experiments about the role of expectations in the experience of drug use to show that", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "drug effects are inherently biological and are not influenced at all by expectations and other psychological factors."}, {"label": "B", "text": "users who do not expect to get addicted to \"hard\" drugs almost always do."}, {"label": "C", "text": "there is no such thing as drug addiction."}, {"label": "D", "text": "sometimes a drug's effects are the direct result of what one expects from the drug."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Shapiro's experiments show that drug effects are influenced by expectations and other psychological factors. For example, if a user expects a drug to produce certain effects, those effects are more likely to occur. This is true whether the drug is a placebo or a real drug.\nExpectations can also influence whether a user becomes addicted. For example, users who do not expect to get addicted to \"hard\" drugs almost always do not.\nThere is evidence that certain drugs can be addictive. For example, some people may be addicted to drugs that they use to relieve stress. Other people may be addicted to drugs that they use to feel good.\nSOLUTION: Read the experiment described in the text carefully.\nThe experiment involved two groups of people who did not use drugs. One group was given a drug that was described as a stimulant, and the other was given a drug that was described as a sedative. Both drugs were actually inactive.\nThe experiment found that people who expected the stimulant to produce alertness and arousal were more alert and aroused after taking the drug than those who expected the stimulant to produce calmness and relaxation.\nSimilarly, people who expected the sedative to produce calmness and relaxation were more calm and relaxed after taking the drug than those who expected it to produce alertness and arousal.\nExpectations can also affect how likely people are to become addicted to a drug.\nExamples of substances that almost never produce addiction include caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco.\nExamples of substances that often produce addiction include cocaine and heroin."}
{"question": " What kind of consequentialist theory does Dershowitz think can justify terrorism in certain extreme particular cases?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "act-based deontology"}, {"label": "B", "text": "rule-based hedonism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "rule utilitarianism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "act utilitarianism"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Dershowitz argues that a rule utilitarian could justify terrorism in certain extreme cases. Rule utilitarianism is a type of consequentialist theory that focuses on the rules and principles that promote the greatest amount of overall happiness or utility. So, according to this theory, the right thing to do is determined by the rules that would produce the most happiness.\nDershowitz mentions the hypothetical case of a terrorist who has a bomb that could kill many people. A rule utilitarian might conclude that it would be better to have a rule that permits terrorists to use bombs if following the rule would produce the most overall utility. The utilitarian would need to calculate the utility that would be produced by following this rule. This calculation might lead the utilitarian to conclude that it would be better to have the rule than to follow the rule in this particular case. So, the rule utilitarian would argue that it is better to have a rule that permits terrorists to use bombs than to follow a rule that prohibits terrorists from using bombs."}

Hardin argues that the commons can be saved by setting it aside as a public park, but this requires that people not be allowed to use the commons for their own purposes.\nIf the proposal were to be realized, the operation must be conducted consistently.\nThis means that if world food banks were established, they would need to be operated consistently over time.\nOnly the richer countries have some moral obligation to make deposits in the world food banks.\nHardin's essay does not discuss the role of richer countries in helping those in need.\nIt would be subject to the tragedy of the commons.\nHardin's essay discusses the possibility that the commons could be saved by setting it aside as a public park. However, he argues that this would require people not to use the commons for their own purposes. If world food banks were established, they could be subject to the same type of overuse and depletion that Hardin associates with the commons.\nWe need to go with the idea because we ought not to punish poor people who are caught in an emergency.\nHardin's essay does not discuss the ethics of punishing people who are caught in an emergency."}

It also does not address the issue of the death penalty.\nThe retributive theory of punishment does claim that punishment should fit the crime, and that the punishment should be proportional to the crime. This means that for a crime as serious as murder, the punishment should be as serious as the crime. The death penalty is a possible punishment for murder in some places. But whether the death penalty is a just punishment for murder is a matter of moral debate."}
{"question": " Mary's laptop deserves moral consideration only because she owns it and cares about it.

For example, if a being values a particular thing, such as a piece of property, does that thing really have moral standing? Or is it the being that has moral standing, and the thing is just valued by that being?\nRelative moral standing means that the moral standing of a being is contingent on its relation to other beings. This view would say that a being has as much moral standing as it can get, based on its relationships with other beings. For example, if a being is part of a family, it has as much moral standing as a family can have. But the being does not have any moral standing outside of the family.\nInherent or intrinsic worth is a view of moral standing. According to this view, beings have moral standing because they have inherent or intrinsic worth. This means that beings have value in and of themselves, apart from their relationships with other beings.\nSOLUTION: Mary's laptop has indirect moral standing. Mary's laptop is something that is valued by Mary, a being with direct moral standing."}

Non-instrumental value means that something is valuable for its own sake, not just as a means to some other end.\nCollins suggests that the non-instrumental value of caring actions comes from the intrinsic value of caring attitudes that motivate caring actions. In other words, the moral value of caring actions comes from the fact that they are motivated by attitudes such as love and compassion."}

But Shapiro argues that this is incorrect. Instead, Shapiro argues that drug laws can affect the price of drugs and that the effect of drug laws on the price of drugs can affect how much of the drug is consumed.\nDrug laws can affect the price of drugs. As mentioned above, by reducing competition among sellers, drug laws can increase the price of drugs. This increase in price can affect how much of the drug is consumed. For example, an increase in price may lead to a decrease in the amount of the drug that is consumed.\nSo, drug laws can affect access to illegal drugs by affecting the price of drugs. If drug laws increase the price of drugs, this may decrease the amount of the drug that is consumed. And if the amount of the drug that is consumed decreases, this may decrease access to the drug."}

One way to do this is to look at the language he uses in the passage.\nKass does not say that cloning is inherently morally wrong. He does not say that we have a good reason not to clone. So, these are not premises of Kass's argument.\nKass does say that in reproductive cloning, one seeks to impose one's will on a child's future. This is a premise of his argument. It is what he believes is wrong with cloning.\nKass does not say that the permissibility of cloning depends on the parent's intent to raise the child. This assertion is not a premise of Kass's argument."}

It tells you what Kamm claims. Kamm claims that Sandel's moral distinction between treatment and enhancement assumes that nature in itself has no moral value.\nNature in itself has no moral value means that the natural world is not inherently good or bad. This view assumes that the value of nature is determined by its use to humans.\nSeveral of the other answer choices are consistent with this view. For example, if human beings want enhancement more than they want treatment, that could be why Kamm says that Sandel's view assumes that nature in itself has no moral value. This would mean that the value of nature is determined by its usefulness to humans."}

In this case, the feeding tube was removed, which allowed Terri Schiavo to die of dehydration.\nVoluntary euthanasia is conducted at the request of the patient. In Terri Schiavo's case, no request was made by her.\nPhysician-assisted suicide is when a physician provides a patient with the means to commit suicide, such as prescribing a lethal dose of medication. In Terri Schiavo's case, no physician assisted in her death.\nActive euthanasia is the deliberate act of ending a patient's life, such as by lethal injection. In Terri Schiavo's case, no lethal injection was administered."}

Kamm argues that sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire.\nKamm's argument does not contradict the claim that all actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible. Kamm is not claiming that actions motivated by bad desires are ever permissible; she is arguing that sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire.\nThe desire for mastery is a bad desire. As Sandel argues, the desire for mastery can lead to actions that are not in the best interest of others.\nSometimes the only way to cure a disease is through selfish desires. This statement is irrelevant to the argument. Whether an action is permissible can depend on the desires of the people involved. But whether a desire is bad can depend on whether the desire leads to actions that are not in the best interest of others."}

So, determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person will not settle the abortion issue.\nSome people argue that a fetus is a person from the moment of conception. If abortion is murder, then abortion is never morally permissible.\nOther people argue that a fetus is not a person until it is viable outside the womb. Viability means that the fetus can survive on its own. If abortion is not murder, then it is morally permissible at least until viability.\nBut whether abortion is murder or not is not the question at hand.

The means of subsistence is not the primary focus of the definition. On the other hand, the violation of fundamental human rights brought about the political structures of a particular government is too narrow of a definition. It does not cover all structural human rights violations. Ongoing patterns of behavior by a large number of agents which predictably result in many others coming to be deprived of the object of a fundamental human right: the means of subsistence is a better fit for a structural human rights violation. However, it is still too narrow of a definition. A structural human rights violation may include deprivations of the means of subsistence, but it may also include other types of violations that affect an individual's practical, social, and political agency. So, all of the above are part of the definition of a structural human rights violation."}

They define the minimum that is owed to people. They are not simply claims that people have, but obligations that are imposed on others.\nFreely made commitments are obligations that people make to others because they have voluntarily entered into an agreement. These commitments include both contractual and other types of agreements.\nSpecial relations are obligations that people have because of their relationship with others. These obligations are not based on voluntary agreement, but on the nature of the relationship. Examples include obligations that parents have to their children and that children have to their parents.\nSOLUTION: Cohen does not consider rights, freely made commitments, and special relations to be the same as obligations. Instead, he considers each of these to be a source of obligations. So, Cohen does not consider any of the above to be a possible source of obligations."}

This argument considers how we would evaluate beings with a mixture of human and animal features. If we exclude animals from having full moral standing, it is not clear why beings with human fetuses or infants with severe cognitive impairments should have full moral standing.\nThe ontological argument and the argument from cosmology do not address the question of what criteria should determine full moral standing. So, they do not pose a formidable challenge to any proposed criterion of full moral standing that excludes animals."}

He believes that a fetus has the potential to develop into a valuable person, and that this potential is all that is needed to make the fetus valuable.\nHe also believes that the fact that the fetus is inside a woman's body is not relevant to the question of whether it is wrong to kill the fetus.

This new state is not necessarily to the system's benefit, but it is difficult to return to the previous state.\nAccording to the underlined text, the use of a world food bank to feed the hungry leads to an escalating series of emergency situations. This can lead to a change in the way food is distributed globally, but this change may not be to the benefit of the hungry. Once this change is made, it may be difficult to return to the previous way of distributing food."}

He does not claim that desires are the only source of evidence, but rather that they are the only evidence of what is desirable.\nHe distinguishes between two types of evidence:\nevidence of what is desirable, and\nevidence of what is good.\nEvidence of what is desirable is not the same as evidence of what is good.\nEvidence of what is good includes evidence of what will produce the greatest amount of pleasure or the least amount of pain. This is evidence of what is good, not evidence of what is desirable.\nEvidence of what is desirable includes evidence of what people actually desire. This is evidence of what is desirable.\nExperts on desirability use evidence of what people actually desire to determine what is desirable. So, evidence of what experts on desirability have deemed desirable is evidence of what is desirable.\nRational insight, or insight into what is rational, is not evidence of what is desirable. Rationality concerns what is good, not what is desirable.\nGod has deemed something desirable because it is good, not because people desire it. So, evidence of what God has deemed desirable is not evidence of what is desirable."}

It can also be used to describe a person's right to be treated with certain things, such as respect and fairness.\nVelleman worries that the word dignity is sometimes used to mean that people have a right to certain things. But this is not what dignity means. Dignity is about how people are seen and valued. It is about how they are treated.\nSo, the word dignity is sometimes used to glorify a patient's worthiness of being protected or cared for. This use of the word dignity is not incorrect. But it is not the only way that dignity can be used."}

Tallness, honesty, and simplicity are virtues of character. Physical beauty is not a virtue of character.\nBeing honest helps an individual be moral by helping him or her tell the truth.\nSimplicity is a virtue of character because it can help an individual be moral by making it easier for him or her to live a simple life. A simple life can be easier to live with integrity."}

He believes that nonhuman creatures have inherent moral worth and that economic motives are not the only moral consideration. An economic motive is a consideration of money or economic efficiency. Leopold is saying that economic motives are not the only thing that is morally relevant."}

The key is in the answer: humans are rational and animals are not.\nSome defenders of meat-eating use this logic to argue that animals do not suffer as much as humans do. They claim that animals do not have the same level of consciousness as humans, so their suffering is not as bad."}

It asks you to identify what Locke is accepting. The question gives you a list of five theories.\nNatural law conception of morality is a theory about the foundation of morality. It holds that there are natural laws that dictate how we ought to behave.\nKantian theory is a theory about the foundation of morality. It holds that moral principles are derived from reason.\nUtilitarianism is a theory about the foundation of morality. It holds that the right course of action is the one that maximizes overall well-being.\nVirtue ethics is a theory about the foundation of morality. It holds that moral principles are based on the virtues.\nBeing able to follow rules is a virtue. So, Locke's argument that we have a duty to obey the rules of government, even when we disagree with them, can be seen as consistent with a virtue ethics approach to morality."}

One way to understand dignity is a capacity for certain kinds of feelings or sentiments.\nAccording to this view, dignity is based in the unique human feelings of self-consciousness, sympathy, and respect. These feelings are not shared by other animals and are what give humans a unique sense of identity and worth."}

It explains that Nathanson proposes a form of retributivism that requires a scale of punishments that correspond to the seriousness of certain crimes.\nNathanson does not discuss the death penalty. He does not include it in his list of responses to serious harm. So, the death penalty for the most serious crimes does not follow from Nathanson's theory."}

Carens's main conclusion is that liberal egalitarians should favor more open immigration policies. Carens argues that immigration restrictions are \"a major obstacle to global equality\" and that liberal egalitarians have good reasons to be skeptical of anticosmopolitanism. But he also acknowledges that anticosmopolitan concerns about cultural difference and the potential loss of solidarity are not unreasonable. Carens argues that these concerns can be addressed through policies that promote cultural assimilation and that allow for the retention of cultural identity by immigrants."}

So, the principle of equality and a consequentialist theory of punishment are out.\nDignity is a concept used in debates about the value of human beings and the moral rules that should guide how we treat each other. Dignity implies certain rights and duties, and it can be threatened or violated by certain actions.\nEquality retributivism is the view that punishment should be proportional to the crime, and that the punishment for killing another person should be the same for everyone who does it. This view holds that people have a right to equal treatment under the law."}

As we discussed earlier, having direct moral standing means that a being is morally considerable for its own sake.\nHaving direct moral standing is what gives you your basic moral rights. These are the rights that you have simply by virtue of being a morally considerable being.\nHaving indirect moral standing means that a being is morally considerable because it is part of a larger being that has direct moral standing.\nHaving relative moral standing means that a being is morally considerable because it has relationships with other beings that have direct or indirect moral standing.\nSOLUTION: Mary is a person, and as such she plausibly deserves moral consideration because of features inherent to her (e.g., being self-aware). This suggests that she has direct moral standing."}

Values shape our ideas about what is important and what is not.\nRights are claims that people have by virtue of being members of a community. Desert is the idea that what people get should be related to what they do.\nJustice is a value that is concerned with fairness and equality.\nFairness is a value that is concerned with treating people in a way that is appropriate and fitting.\nRespect for other persons is a value that is concerned with showing consideration for the worth and dignity of other people.\nThese values are not rights or desert. They are more fundamental than both rights and desert.\nSOLUTION: Arthur believes that justice, fairness, respect for other persons, and rights are values that are more fundamental than rights and desert."}

It states that one should act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law. In other words, choose your actions as if your actions were a universal law that everyone had to follow.\nIf you never used other people as a means to your own ends, this would be a universal law that everyone had to follow. This law would prevent people from being treated as mere means to other people's ends. So, the best way to follow the categorical imperative is to never use other people as a means to your own ends."}

This means that he believes that moral principles can place constraints on what is possible, and that these constraints can make certain actions impossible to perform, even if they would be the right thing to do.\nA moral principle can place a constraint on what is possible by defining a specific set of circumstances that would make an action right. For example, the moral principle that one should not kill defines a set of circumstances in which the killing is right. If a set of circumstances fits this definition, then the killing is right. But the principle also defines a set of circumstances that would make the killing impossible to perform. If a set of circumstances fits the definition of the moral principle, then the killing is impossible to perform, even if it would be the right thing to do.\nSo, Nagel denies the moral principle that ought implies can. This means that he belves that there can be a distinction between what one ought to do and what one can do."}

How do you determine what type of punishment is justified? You need to figure out what the wrongdoing was and what was wrong with it.\nImagine a driver who speeding on a windy day. The driver's action was to speed. The unfriendly action that is proportionate to the unfriendly wrongdoing, aimed at correcting the wrongdoing. is to give the driver a ticket. The ticket is an unfriendly action that is proportionate to the unfriendly wrongdoing of speeding. It is aimed at correcting the wrongdoing and preventing it from happening in the future.\nAnother driver is careless and causes a harmful accident. The driver's action was to drive carelessly. The harmful punishment that is proportionate to the harm done by the wrongdoing is to fine the driver. The fine should be proportionate to the harm caused by the driver's carelessness. This punishment would be harmful, but it would be proportionate to the harm done by the wrongdoing.\nYet another driver throws a piece of litter on the ground. The driver's action was to litter. The degradation proportionate to the degrading impacts of the wrongdoing is to make the driver pick up the litter. This punishment is degrading, but it is proportionate to the degrading impact of the wrongdoing."}

This means that each person has an equal right to the social and economic inequalities that are built into society.\nThese inequalities include opportunities and resources that belong to that person but nobody else. For example, if a person has a talent for music, they have a right to the opportunities and resources that would allow them to develop and use that talent.\nThe principle of greatest equal liberty also allows for the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similarly liberty for others. This means that each person has the right to basic liberties, such as freedom of speech and religion, as long as these liberties do not infringe on the similar liberties of others."}

It says that Hardin was concerned about the \"tragedy of the commons,\" which is a situation in which individuals acting in their own self-interest use up a shared resource. Hardin believed that this situation could be avoided with private property and a tax on use of the resource.\nHardin did not argue that sharing ethics is anti-Christian, and he did not argue that sharing ethics would lead to a stronger system of taxation for the affluent."}

This means that the greater moral evil rule allows for the greater good to be achieved by sacrificing the lesser good.\nThis principle allows for the idea that it is permissible to keep some earnings, even if this means that a greater evil cannot be prevented by giving them away. This is because the earnings are not the cause of the greater evil."}

This culture encourages students to confabulate reasons to feel oppressed, and it leads universities to bear overly burdensome legal obligations.\nHowever, Lukianoff and Haidt do not argue that the pursuit of justice by marking out racism, sexism, and classism is misguided or wrong. Instead, they argue that the trend to uncover microaggressions has led to a narrow focus on speech codes and trigger warnings, to the exclusion of other important forms of social justice work."}

Doing anything that would make them parties to injustice includes doing anything that would make them act as terrorists do. Terrorists do two main things: they attack civilians, and they try to spread fear and terror.\nWalzer argues that we should not use tactics that would make us act as terrorists do. This means that we should not attack civilians, and it means that we should not try to spread fear and terror.\nThe first two choices are on the test:\nWe make an effort to convince the terrorists that they are acting wrongly.\nWe avoid harming terrorists to the same extent that we would avoid harming innocent civilians.\nThese choices identify tactics that would not make us act as terrorists do.\nThe third choice is not on the test:\nWe attack the lower-ranking terrorists first.\nThis choice does not address the criteria for a just war.\nThis choice just sets out a tactic that may be more or less effective in responding to terrorism.\nThe fourth choice is not on the test:\nWe do not repeat the wrongs of terrorism in the process.\nThis choice may refer to tactics that are not in accord with the criteria for a just war.\nRepeating the wrongs of terrorism would make us parties to injustice."}

Practical reasoning is the ability to figure out what to do. Self-awareness is the ability to reflect on what one is doing.\nAnimals can use practical reasoning to figure out what to do in order to get food or avoid predators. But they do not have self-awareness. So, animals lack the capacity for rational agency.\nConscious experience is one part of the capacity for rational agency. So, animals lack the capacity for conscious experience as well.\nAnimals can suffer. So, they have the capacity for suffering."}

One example is pollution. Pollution can affect the health of people living near factories or power plants. But because the factories and power plants are often in poorer neighborhoods, the external costs of pollution are often imposed on people who are less politically powerful than the factories and power plants.\nAnother example of an externality is crime. Crime can affect people who are not involved in the transaction that led to the crime. For example, if a bank is robbed, the bank's customers may be affected.\nAuthoritarian regimes are a type of government. While authoritarian regimes may have the ability to prevent negative externalities, this is not their primary purpose. Authoritarian regimes are designed to concentrate power in the hands of the ruler and to restrict individual freedoms.\nAn unequal social order is a type of externality. An unequal social order is created when there are large differences in wealth or income between people. Such differences can lead to social conflicts and can make it difficult for people to move up the economic ladder."}

Nussbaum's critique can be seen as an application of the ethics of prima facie duty, which holds that we have a duty to respect certain rights and capacities of individuals.\nOne of the central parts of Nussbaum's critique is her argument that the \"expectations\" essay can be seen as a form of moral manipulation. She notes that the essay appeals to the idea that people will want to live up to the expectations of others, and that this appeal is designed to get people to change their consumption habits. But this appeal is problematic, according to Nussbaum, because it is based on a view of human beings as easily manipulated by their social environment.\nThis criticism can be seen as an application of the ethics of prima facie duty. According to this theory, we have a duty to respect people's capacities and to not manipulate them. Nussbaum's argument is that the \"expectations\" essay manipulates people by appealing to their desire to live up to the expectations of others.\nAnother part of Nussbaum's critique is her argument that the \"expectations\" essay is based on a view of human beings as self-interested and as having a fixed set of preferences. This view is problematic, according to Nussbaum, because it is based on a conception of human beings that is too limited.\nThis criticism can be seen as an application of the ethics of prima facie duty. According to this theory, we have a duty to respect the capacities of human beings. One of the capacities that this theory holds is the capacity to develop new preferences and values. Nussbaum's argument is that the \"expectations\" essay is based on a view of human beings that does not respect this capacity.\nSOLUTION: Nussbaum's critique can be seen as a criticism of the \"expectations\" essay from a virtue ethics approach. Virtue ethics is a view about the right way to live life. It holds that we should live life in a way that develops certain virtues. Nussbaum's argument is that the \"expectations\" essay is based on a view of human beings that does not respect the capacities that virtue ethics holds are important."}

This means that the use of torture in any case would be permitted, not just the use of torture in the ticking bomb case.\nIt is virtually impossible for torture to be limited to just one instance. This is because torture is a harmful practice that can have long-lasting and far-reaching consequences. As such, once torture is initiated, it is difficult to control and may continue for longer than intended."}

Instead, she argues that caring attitudes are not just based on empathy and compassion, but also on attentiveness to the needs of the cared-for person. This means that we can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly, by paying attention to the needs of others.\nFurthermore, Collins does not claim that we are responsible for our attitudes in the sense that we can simply decide to have any attitude we want. Instead, she argues that we are responsible for the attitudes we have and the actions that result from them. So, when we fail to have attitudes of care toward someone, we are still responsible for that lack of care."}

Kant believed that people have intrinsic value as rational beings, and that it is wrong to use them as a means to an end.\nConsequentialism and utilitarianism are moral theories that focus on the consequences of actions. These theories would not see using someone as a mere means as inherently wrong.\nNatural law theory is a moral theory that holds that there are universal principles of justice and that these principles should be used to guide our actions. Using someone as a mere means would violate the principle of justice that requires respect for persons."}

Intrinsic value is a measure of how much a particular outcome is valued for its own sake.\nPunishments are aimed at producing a change in the offender's behavior. To determine which punishment would produce the most overall intrinsic value, you would have to estimate how much each punishment would change the offender's behavior and then compare that to how much each punishment is valued for its own sake.\nThe other answer choices are not necessary conditions for consequentialist punishment.\nProportionality does not require that the punishment produce the most overall intrinsic value. An alternative approach is to argue that the punishment should be proportional to the wrongness of the crime, as measured by the severity of the harm that the crime caused. This approach does not require that the punishment produce the most overall intrinsic value.\nTreating the person as an end in themselves does not require that the punishment produce the most overall intrinsic value. On this approach, the punishment is justified if it is consistent with treating the person as an end in themselves. The value of treating someone as an end in themselves is not a measure of how much a particular outcome is valued for its own sake."}

According to him, the law is a rule of conduct that is binding on all members of a community. The common good is the sum of the goods that a community's members consider important. So, the law is ordained to the common good because the law is a means to that end. The law cannot ordain itself to the truth, human perfection, or individual happiness. These things are not rules of conduct that are binding on all members of a community. So, the law cannot be ordained to them."}

But other things are not equal in the cases described in the question.\nPoisoning food is an active act. Sending poisoned food is more like killing someone than is letting them die by withholding medicine or information.\nWithholding medicine is also an active act. Withholding medicine is more like killing someone than is letting them die by withholding information.\nDepriving someone of information is not an active act.

This means that there is something special about humans that makes us the only beings who can bear rights. Cohen believes that this special thing is our capacity for self-awareness and rationality.\nOther animals may have some form of awareness or consciousness, but they do not have the same level of self-awareness and rationality that humans do.

According to Corvino, the \"unnaturalness\" charge can carry moral weight only if those who level it can do two things: explain the harms of anal sex and establish that all homosexuals will inevitably suffer those harms.\nThere are many ways in which sexual behavior can be harmful, and it is certainly possible that engaging in anal sex could be harmful. But it is not clear that all homosexuals will inevitably suffer those harms. So, those who claim that homosexuality is immoral because it is unnatural have not done the necessary work to make their case."}
{"question": " Mill defends the harm principle on the basis of which moral theory?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Kantian moral theory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Utilitarianism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The ethics of prima facie duty"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Social contract theory"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Mill defends the harm principle on the basis of the ethics of prima facie duty. The harm principle is the principle that says that the only time a government has a right to interfere with an individual's liberty is when that individual's actions cause harm to others. This principle is based on the idea that individuals have a right to freedom of action, but that this right is subject to the duty not to harm others.\nThis is an example of the ethics of prima facie duty. The ethics of prima facie duty is the idea that individuals have certain duties that they must fulfill as a matter of course. These duties are called \"prima facie\" duties, which means that they must be fulfilled unless there is a compelling reason not to. The harm principle is an example of a prima facie duty. It tells individuals that they have a duty not to harm others, unless doing so would be necessary to prevent greater harm."}

Carruthers argues that our moral obligations to animals are indirect and derivative.\nAn indirect duty is one that is not owed to an individual but to some other person or group. For example, a duty to help the poor is indirect because the obligation is not to the individual but to the group. Derivative duties are duties that are based on other duties. The duty to help the poor is also derivative because the duty to help the poor is based on the duty to help fellow human beings.\nCarruthers argues that our duty to avoid cruelty to animals is a derivative duty. This means that the duty is based on other duties,, and in this case, the duty is based on the duty to avoid cruelty to fellow human beings.\nSome people argue that we have direct and basic duties to avoid cruelty to animals. But Carruthers believes that these duties are not based on other duties. So, they are indirect and derivative."}

It tells you what absolutism is.\nAbsolutism is the view that we should always follow the moral rules that forbid murder.\nAvoidance is not a duty. A duty is an obligation. Obligations are indebted to others. Avoidance is not indebted to anyone. So, avoidance is not a moral duty.\nIf avoidance is not a duty, then absolutism implies that we should sometimes prevent murder. This means that absolutism is inconsistent."}

The four principles of justice are: (1) equality, or fairness, in the distribution of goods; (2) fairness, or justice, in the distribution of goods; (3) the right to acquire goods, or wealth, through one's own efforts; and (4) the right to keep what one has acquired, or wealth.\nThe principle of equality/fairness in the distribution of goods holds that people should get the same goods if they have the same needs. The principle of fairness/justice in the distribution of goods holds that people should get different goods based on their needs.\nThe principle of the right to acquire goods through one's own efforts holds that people have the right to acquire goods as a result of their own efforts. This principle supports the idea that people should be able to get goods by working for them.\nThe principle of the right to keep what one has acquired holds that people have the right to keep the goods they have acquired. This principle supports the idea that people have a right to their own property.\nSinger does not ignore the principles of equality and harm. He argues that these principles support assistance to the poor. He also does not ignore the principles of the right and the good. He argues that it is good to do what we can to help others.\nSinger does ignore the principles of rights and desert. The principle of rights states that people have a right to goods if they have a right to them. The principle of desert states that people get the goods they have a right to. These principles are concerned with the distribution of goods based on people's rights and deserts. Singer does not argue that people have a right to goods because they have a right to them. He does not argue that people get the goods they have a right to."}

So, if sexual attraction involves seeing another person in this way, then sexual relations could be seen as immoral.\nHowever, Kant does not think that this means that all sexual relations are immoral. Instead, he thinks that sexual attraction can be moral if, and only if, the person is treated as an end in themselves, not as a means to our own ends. In other words, sexual attraction can be moral if we see the other person as worthy of respect and love, not just as someone to satisfy our own desires."}

These actions are \"adaptive\" in the sense that they increase the chances of survival and reproduction. Over time, natural selection has favored actions that are adaptive. So, according to the basic principle of natural law theory, an action is right if and only if it is of a type that the laws of natural selection have favored.\nIn order to determine whether a action is of a type that has been favored by natural selection, you need to figure out what promotes survival and reproduction. This involves identifying the basic values that guide natural selection.\nSome examples of basic values that promote survival and reproduction are:\nincreasing the chances of survival and reproduction for the actor and their offspring;\nincreasing the chances of survival and reproduction for the actor's group;\nincreasing the chances of survival and reproduction for some other group of organisms.\nAn action is of a type that has been favored by natural selection if it is designed to increase the chances of survival and reproduction for the actor and/or their group and/or some other group of organisms.\nSOLUTION: Look at the different actions proposed and decide which ones are of a type that have been favored by natural selection.\nAn action that increases the chances of survival and reproduction for the actor and their offspring is of a type that has been favored by natural selection. So, the basic principle of natural law theory would judge such an action to be right.\nAn action that increases the chances of survival and reproduction for the actor's group is of a type that has been favored by natural selection. So, the basic principle of natural law theory would judge such an action to be right.\nAn action that increases the chances of survival and reproduction for some other group of organisms is of a type that has been favored by natural selection. So, the basic principle of natural law theory would judge such an action to be right.\nAn action that does not increase the chances of survival and reproduction for the actor and their offspring, for the actor's group, or for any other group of organisms is not of a type that has been favored by natural selection. So, the basic principle of natural law theory would judge such an action to be wrong."}

Mutual denial of humanity between partners in an intimate relationship can lead to sexual objectification.\nIf both partners in an intimate relationship deny each other's humanity, they may treat each other as objects for their own use. This can include treating the other person as a sexual object. So, in this case, sexual objectification may occur."}

The Universal Law formulation is a standard that an agent's actions must meet to achieve moral excellence.\nA way to measure the value of an action's consequences is not the purpose of the Universal Law formulation. The Universal Law formulation is a consistency test that an agent's maxims must pass.\nThe Universal Law formulation is a kind of consistency test. The formulation helps identify moral conflicts by asking whether a maxim could be a universal law of nature."}

These implications include the inability to explain why it would be wrong to force Canada to join NAFTA and the inability to explain why it would be wrong for the United States to forcefully annex Canada.\nIf a country has a right to freedom of association, it has a right to choose with whom it associates. The implication of denying this right is that it would be difficult to explain why it would be wrong to force Canada to join NAFTA or to forcefully annex Canada."}

{"question": " According to Kant, an imperative that represents an action as a necessary means to something that is willed is what kind of imperative?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "categorical"}, {"label": "B", "text": "universalizable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hypothetical"}, {"label": "D", "text": "noumenal"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: An imperative is a type of proposition that tells you what to do. Imperatives can be represented as statements of the form 'do this' or 'refrain from this.'\nImperatives can be classified by the way they are formulated. One way to do this is by considering the relation that the imperative sets up between the action described in the imperative and the purpose of that action.\nAn imperative that represents an action as a necessary means to something that is willed is an imperative that sets up a relation of necessity. This type of imperative tells you that you must perform the action in order to achieve a certain purpose. The action described in the imperative is not willed for its own sake. Instead, the action is willed as a means to achieve a further end.\nAn imperative that sets up a relation of necessity is a categorical imperative. A categorical imperative is an imperative that represents an action as necessary, regardless of your desires or interests.\nA categorical imperative is universal. This means that the imperative applies to everyone, regardless of their individual desires or interests.\nA hypothetical imperative is an imperative that is based on a specific desire or interest. This type of imperative represents an action as necessary for the satisfaction of a specific desire or interest.\nA hypothetical imperative is not universalizable. This means that the imperative does not apply to everyone, but only to individuals who have a specific desire or interest.\nA noumenal imperative is an imperative that is not based on any particular desires or interests. This type of imperative is sometimes called a pure imperative.\nNo such thing as a noumenal imperative. As Assistant: imperative sets up a relation of necessity, it must have a rational ground. A noumenal imperative would tell you to do something without any rational ground. This makes no sense."}

He says that we have been treating the natural world as if it is a commodity to be exploited for our own purposes. He argues that we need to recognize the intrinsic value of the natural world, and that we need to think about land use in terms of ethical and ecological concerns, not just economic concerns.\nThese claims are all consistent with this central message. The problem with the economy and our values is that they do not distinguish between goods and bads. Goods are economic, but bads are not. The economy often treats pollution and deforestation as goods, and they are not. The economy often treats community and beauty as goods, and they are not. The economy often treats grassland and wetland as goods, and they are not.\nThe claim that Leopold would clearly accept is B. The problems associated with how we should use our natural environment are not merely economic problems, but they are problems about how we value the environment. To properly appreciate the value of the environment, we need to recognize the balance of nature."}

He contends that if a person does not have a good reason for a belief, then they do not know it is true. But if they have a good reason for a belief, then they know it is true for them, even if it is not true in an absolute sense. So, for Mill, the absence of a good reason for a belief is a sign that the person does not know the truth of the belief."}

The scope of morality refers to the types of actions that morality applies to. Norcross is arguing that the scope of morality is not limited to human actions. Instead, he claims that it also includes actions that affect other animals.\nNorcross supports his claim that animal suffering is a moral issue by comparing it to the torture of puppies. He says that if it is wrong to torture puppies for the sake of our own eating pleasure, it is also wrong to cause unnecessary suffering in other animals that we raise for food.\nThe only choice that directly addresses the issue of animal suffering is C. Choice A does not directly address the issue of animal suffering. Choice B and D do not address the issue of animal suffering. Choice B implies that following the Golden Rule is enough to ensure that we do not cause unnecessary suffering in animals. But the Golden Rule only tells you to treat others the way you want to be treated. It does not address the issue of animal suffering. Choice D tells you to treat others the way you want to be treated. But again, it does not address the issue of animal suffering."}

One of the consequences is the execution of innocent persons. Fourteen states have executed persons who were later found to be innocent. Another consequence is the great financial cost of the death penalty. California has spent an average of $184 million annually on its death row program. The incitement effect refers to the possibility that the death penalty may increase the likelihood of murder. The prevention of future murders is a argument in favor of the death penalty."}

The writer, Lawrence A. Kurdi, frames the question in terms of whether people who destroy the environment are bad people. The problem with this question, according to Hill, is that it leads to the false conclusion that people who are not bad in other areas of their lives are bad people when they engage in environmentally harmful activities.\nHill wants to ask a different question: why the act of destroying nature might be immoral. This question is important because it focuses on the act of destroying nature, rather than the people who destroy nature. It also avoids the implication that people who engage in environmentally harmful activities are bad people."}

To do this, a moral theory needs to explain how to act in a way that is both good and practical.\nParsimony refers to the principle that, all else being equal, we should choose the theory that posits the fewest numbers of entities. This principle does not ensure that a theory is more practical.\nExplanatory power refers to the principle that, other things being equal, we should choose the theory that provides the most comprehensive explanation of the relevant phenomena. This principle does not ensure that a theory is more practical.\nPractical guidance refers to the principle that, other things being equal, we should choose the theory that provides the best practical guidance. This principle ensures that a theory is practical.\nExamples of practical guidance include the principle that we should not kill, and the principle that we should help others.\nExplanatory power does not ensure that a theory is more practical. For example, a theory that explains why it is wrong to eat meat may not be as practical as a theory that explains why it is wrong to eat food that has expired."}

By recognizing that we have backup duties to donate to aid agencies, Ashford argues that we can acknowledge that effective altruism fails to be the right response to global poverty. Feeling relieved about our duties to the global poor, since backup duties are not morally urgent, is not an appropriate response to Ashford's argument."}

Dershowitz does not argue that torture is permissible in any and all cases, nor does he argue that no democratic society should allow public officials to engage in illegal actions \"off the books.\" Dershowitz does argue that a democratic society should have a system of laws that allows for the use of torture in ticking bomb cases, but he does not argue that torture is permissible in all cases."}

In other words, according to Kant, persons have inherent value or worth, and this value is not based on their usefulness to others. Rather, persons have this value simply by virtue of being persons.\nKant refers to this inherent value of persons as dignity. Dignity is a type of praiseworthiness that is not based on the usefulness of the person to others. Instead, it is based on the person's ability to act in accordance with the moral law.\nBeauty, on the other hand, refers to the inherent value of objects, not of persons.\nVirtue and praiseworthiness are related to the moral worth of actions, not to the inherent value of persons."}

He observes that many sub-Saharan Africans believe that it is wrong to take a life, and that doing so would show a lack of respect for the inherent dignity of the person who was killed. He goes on to argue that this value does not necessarily entail opposition to the death penalty, because the death penalty is not necessarily a taking of life. However, Metz does conclude that the death penalty is degrading, and so therefore wrong.\nThe words in bold in the passage indicate that Metz believes that dignity-based arguments based on African values fail because they do not show that the death penalty is degrading.\nChoices:\nA. is incorrect.\nIt does not show that capital punishment is degrading.\nB. is incorrect.\nThe paragraph says that dignity-based arguments based on African values fail.

A mother carrying a fetus is someone who is pregnant. A mere biological mother is someone who has given birth. A mother in a thick, normative sense is someone who is engaged in the complex, practical, and emotionally laden job of raising a child. The three are not the same. Why not? Being a mother in the thick, normative sense is not just a matter of having a child. It is also a matter of having various preferences and values. ...\nA gestating mother is somewhere in between a mere biological mother and a mother in a thick, normative sense. Between 1973 and 2015, the maternal mortality rate in the United States nearly tripled, from 12 to 30 deaths per 100,000 live births. The increase was mostly due to pregnancy-related complications, including heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. So, being a mere biological mother is not as safe as being a mother in a thick, normative sense. But being a mother in a thick, normative sense is not as safe as it could be. ...\nA mother carrying a fetus is someone who is pregnant. A mere biological mother is someone who has given birth. A mother in a thick, normative sense is someone who is engaged in the complex, practical, and emotionally laden job of raising a child. ...\nConsider a thought experiment. It is possible to remove a fetus from a pregnant mother and place it in the womb of another woman. This is not possible for a mere biological mother. But it is possible for a mother in a thick, normative sense. So, being a mother in a thick, normative sense is a matter of more than just giving birth. It is also a matter of raising a child."}

It argues that the best actions are those that have the best overall consequences.\nAccording to utilitarianism, actions are right or wrong based on their consequences. A right action is one that produces the best overall consequences, and a wrong action is one that produces bad overall consequences.\nOne important aspect of utilitarianism is that it focuses on the overall effects of actions. It does not focus on the intentions of the person performing the action, or on the act itself, or on the duties that one has inherited through implicit social contracts.\nThere are, however, many other moral theories that focus on different aspects of actions. These theories include deontological ethics, virtue ethics, and social contract theories.\nDeontological ethics focuses on the act itself and the intentions of the person performing the act. Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the person performing the act. Social contract theories focus on the duties that one has inherited through implicit social contracts."}

According to Singer, being at least six feet tall and having an IQ of at least 150 are positional goods. Singer's definition does not rely on the idea that there is a \"normal\" height or IQ. Rather, Singer's definition says that these goods are positional goods because their value depends on the position of the good in a distribution.\nBeing at least six feet tall is a positional good in the population described in the question. At average height, people in this population are six feet tall, and they are valued because they are taller than the average. But, in a population where six feet is below average height, being six feet tall would not be valuable.\nHaving an IQ of at least 150 is a positional good in the population described in the question. At average IQ, people in this population have an IQ of 150, and they are valued because they are more intelligent than the average.
