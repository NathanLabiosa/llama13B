The chemical shift can be used to determine the pH of a solution.\nThe chemical shift of H2PO4\u203e is 3.42 ppm. The chemical shift of HPO42\u2013 is 5.82 pPM. As the pH of the solution changes, the ratio of H2PO4\u203e to HPO42\u2013 in the solution changes. This ratio change affects the average chemical shift of the phosphorus atoms in the solution.\nIf the pH of the solution equals the pKa of H2PO4\u203e, the chemical shift will be equal to 3.41 ppm.\nThe pKa of a compound is a measure of the acidity of that compound. It is the negative log10 of the acid dissociation constant (Ka) of the compound. The pKa of H2PO4\u203e is 2.17.\nIf the pH of the solution equals the pKa of H2PO4\u203e, the ratio of H2PO4\u203e to HPO42\u2013 in the solution is equal to the ratio of 2.17 to 5.82. This ratio means that there are more H2PO4\u203e molecules than HPO42\u2013 molecules in the solution.\nSince there are more H2PO4\u203e molecules, the average chemical shift of the phosphorus atoms is 3.41 ppm."}

Unlike other types of nuclear fuel, a radioactive isotope does not continue to release energy for a long time. Instead, it releases energy until it \"decays\" into a different, non-radioactive isotope. This process is called radioactive decay.\nThe time it takes for a radioactive isotope to decay into a different isotope is called its half-life. The half-life of a radioactive isotope is a measure of the time when only half of the isotope decays. So, for a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 6.0 hours, half of the isotope will decay in 6.0 hours.\nSOLUTION: A half-life of 6.0 hours means that the isotope will decay to half of its original value in 6.0 hours. So, after 6.0 hours, there will be 150 mCi / 2 = 75 mCi of the isotope left.\nAfter another 6.0 hours, the isotope will decay to half of its remaining value. So, there will be 75 mCi / 2 = 38 mCi of the isotope left."}

Because the fluorescent molecule is no longer fluorescing, the assistant professor can tell that the specific molecule is present.\nParamagnetic metal ions are a type of metal ion that can be used as a quencher.

This means that the metal ion can be charged two different ways during the reaction.\nSOLUTION: To be found at the active site of a redox enzyme, a metal ion must be able to take at least two different oxidation states. Copper, iron, and cobalt are the only metals that can do this. So, the only metals from the first three groups that can be found at the active site of redox enzymes are Cu, Fe, and Co.\nZinc, calcium, and gallium cannot be found at the active site of redox enzymes. Neutral zinc, calcium, and gallium are not involved in redox reactions.\nSr, Ga, and Mg are not involved in redox reactions. These metals do not change their oxidation state. So, they cannot be found at the active site of redox enzymes.\nAluminum is an unusual metal. It does not have a stable oxidation state! So, aluminum cannot be found at the active site of redox enzymes."}

An atom's electron affinity can change when an atom absorbs an electron.\nScientists use different types of models to describe atoms. One type of model is the atomic orbital model. In this model, each orbital represents a region in space where an electron may be found. The number of orbitals in an atom is equal to the number of electrons in the atom.\nThe energy of an electron is determined by the distance it is from the nucleus. Orbitals that are closer to the nucleus have lower energy than orbitals that are farther away. The orbitals in an atom are ordered by their energy. This ordering is called the electron configuration of the atom.\nSOLUTION: The electron affinity of an atom tends to decrease as the number of electrons in the atom decreases. So, atoms with fewer electrons have lower electron affinities.\nSi has the fewest electrons of all the atoms. So, Si has the lowest electron affinity."}

Different substances have EPR spectra with different numbers of lines. The numbers of lines in an EPR spectrum are clues that can be used to identify a substance.\nSOLUTION: Dimethylnitroxide has one nitrogen atom. Each nitrogen atom can bond with one hydrogen atom and with one electron. So, each molecule of dimethylnitroxide has one hydrogen atom and one electron.\nThere are two hydrogen atoms in dimethylnitroxide. So, the EPR spectrum of a solution of dimethylnitroxide will have 2 lines.\nThe lines in the EPR spectrum do not overlap. So, the EPR spectrum will have 21 lines."}
