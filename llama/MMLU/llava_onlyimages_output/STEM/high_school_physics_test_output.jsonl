The flow speed is affected by the diameter of the pipe.\nThe flow speed is given by the following equation:\nflow speed = diameter of the pipe / 18\n\nFor example, if the diameter of the pipe is 2 cm, the flow speed is:\nflow speed = 2 cm / 18 m/s\nAnd if the diameter of the pipe is 4 cm, the flow speed is:\nflow speed = 4 cm / 18 m/s\n\nSOLUTION: At the given point in the pipe, the diameter is 2 cm and the flow speed is 18 m/s. So, the flow speed is equal to 2 cm / 18 m/s.\nThe diameter at the other point in the pipe is 3 cm. So, the flow speed at that point is:\n3 cm / 18 m/s = 6 m/s."}
{"question": "An ideal fluid flows through a pipe with radius Q and flow speed V.

One of the properties of fluids is that the flow speed of the fluid is equal to the distance over which the fluid flows divided by the time it takes to flow through that distance. This property is called the fluid's flow speed.\nThe flow speed of a fluid is a function of the radius of the pipe through which the fluid flows. For a fluid flowing through a pipe with radius R, the flow speed is given by the equation:\nV = Q / (2R)\nThis equation says that the flow speed is equal to the quantity of the fluid that is flowing per time, divided by the distance over which the fluid flows per time.\nThe quantity of the fluid that is flowing per time is given by the volume of the fluid divided by the time it takes to flow. The volume of the fluid is given by the formula:\nQ = VR\nSubstituting Q = VR into the equation for flow speed, we get:\nV = VR / (2R)\nV = 1 / (2R)\nSo, the flow speed of a fluid is equal to 1 / (2R).\nSOLUTION: When a fluid flows through a pipe with radius R, the flow speed is given by the equation:\nV = 1 / (2R)\nIf the pipe splits up into three separate paths, each with radius R/2, the flow speed through each of the paths is:\nV = 1 / (2R/2) = 1 / R = V/2\nSo, the flow speed through each of the paths is 1/3 V."}

The normal force is equal in magnitude to the weight of the object.\nThe weight of an object is determined by its mass and acceleration due to gravity.\nWhen an object is on a surface with an inclined plane, the angle of the plane affects the magnitude of the normal force.\nThe normal force increases as the angle of the plane decreases.\nThe normal force decreases as the angle of the plane increases.\nSo, if the angle of the plane is measured from the horizontal, the normal force does not change when the angle of the plane is 0\u00b0 (horizontal plane). It increases as the angle of the plane becomes more negative, and it decreases as the angle of the plane becomes more positive."}

The total kinetic energy of the two carts is:\nK = 1/2 \u00d7 m + 4m = 1/2 \u00d7 5m.\nBecause the collision is elastic, the total kinetic energy before the collision is equal to the total kinetic energy after the collision. So,\n1/2 \u00d7 m + 4m = 1/2 \u00d7 5m.\nSolving this equation for v, the velocity of cart A, gives you the value of v.\nVelocity is a magnitude, or a measure of distance per time. It is different from speed, which is a measure of distance per time without considering the direction of the object.\nThe magnitude of a velocity is given by the Pythagorean theorem:\nv = sqrt(v^2).\nSo, the magnitude of the velocity of cart A is 1.41v, not v."}

For a pure substance, the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure of the gas.\nThe volume of the gas is reduced, which means that the number of gas molecules is reduced. But, the temperature remains constant, so the pressure of the gas must increase to compensate for the smaller volume.\nThe pressure of the gas is given by the formula:\nP = n/V\nwhere P is the pressure of the gas, n is the number of gas molecules, and V is the volume of the gas.\nThe number of gas molecules is reduced, but the volume is reduced more, so the pressure must increase.\nThe number of gas molecules is given by the formula:\nn = PV/R\nwhere R is the gas constant.\nSubstituting the given values, you can calculate the initial pressure and the final pressure as follows:\nInitial pressure = P = n/V = (1 \u00d7 105 Pa)/(20 cm3/molecule) = 5 \u00d7 105 Pa\nFinal pressure = P = n/V = (0.5 \u00d7 105 Pa)/(5 cm3/molecule) = 0.25 \u00d7 105 Pa"}

The friction force will be in the opposite direction to the direction the motor lifts the mass.\nThe efficiency of the electric motor is 75%. This means that 75% of the energy supplied to the motor is used to lift the mass. The other 25% is lost to friction and other losses.\nThe input power to the motor is 120V AC, 1.0 Amps, 60 Hz.

You can use the efficiency of the motor to find the speed it needs to lift the mass.\nYou can calculate the speed as follows:\n120 watts / 0.75 = 1.6 kg m/s\n1.6 kg m/s / 6 kg mass = 0.267 m/s^2\n0.267 m/s^2 / 6 kg mass = 0.044 m/s^2\n0.044 m/s^2 / 1.0 kg = 0.044 m/s^2\n0.044 m/s^2 x 0.5 m = 0.022 m/s"}

The magnitude of the mass of the electron is 9.11 x 10-31 kg. The speed of the electron is 2.00 x 103 m/s.\nThe radius of the path for a clockwise rotation is:\nmv/(eB) = 9.11 x 10-31 kg x 2.00 x 103 m/s / (1.60 x 10-19 C/kg x 2.00 x 10-3 T) = 4.85 x 10-3 m.\nThe radius of the path for a counterclockwise rotation is:\neB/(mv) = 1.60 x 10-19 C/kg x 2.00 x 103 m/s / (9.11 x 10-31 kg x 2.00 x 10-3 T) = 4.85 x 10-3 m.\nSo, the radius of the path is the same for both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation."}

Oscillators can be designed to have a specific pattern of motion.\nThe period of a pendulum is a measure of the time it takes for the pendulum to complete one swing. The formula for the period of a pendulum is:\nperiod = 2\u03c0 / frequency of oscillation\nwhere frequency of oscillation is the number of swings per second.\nSOLUTION: The formula for the period of a pendulum is:\nperiod = 2\u03c0 / frequency of oscillation.\nThe frequency of oscillation is given by the formula:\nfrequency of oscillation = 1 / period.\nSo, the period is equal to 2\u03c0 / frequency of oscillation.\nTo decrease the period of the pendulum, you want to increase the frequency of oscillation. You can do this by either decreasing the angle from the horizontal when the string is released or by decreasing the mass of the ball.\nDecreasing the angle from the horizontal when the string is released has the same effect as decreasing the mass of the ball. So, either way, the period of the pendulum will decrease."}

So, when the capacitors are fully charged, they store a total of 2 \u03bcF x 600 \u03bcC = 1200 \u03bcC.\nThis is a decrease in the total amount of charge stored compared to the 2 \u03bcF capacitor.

This force is called an electrostatic attraction if the spheres are of the same polarity, and a electrostatic repulsion if they are of opposite polarity.\nAn electric field is a force field that pulls or pushes on electric charges. When a nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, an electric field is induced within the conducting sphere.\nThe electric field that is induced within the conducting sphere is strongest at its surface. It pulls or pushes on the charges in the conducting sphere. The stronger the electric field, the more strongly the charges in the conducting sphere are pulled or pushed.\nThe magnitude of the electric field is called the electrostatic potential. The higher the electrostatic potential, the more strongly the electric field pulls or pushes on the charges.\nThe electrostatic potential is greater at the surface of the conducting sphere than at its center. So, the electric field is stronger at the surface of the conducting sphere than at its center.\nThe charges in the conducting sphere that are closer to the noncharged sphere will be more strongly pulled or pushed by the electric field than the charges that are farther away. So, the closer the noncharged sphere is to the conducting sphere, the more strongly the charges in the conducting sphere will be pulled or pushed.\nSOLUTION: The electrostatic attraction and repulsion between two spheres depend on the distance between them. The distance between the two spheres is smallest at the center of each sphere. So, the electrostatic attraction and repulsion are greatest at the center of each sphere.\nThe noncharged sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, so, it will experience an electrostatic repulsion from the conducting sphere.

The magnitude of the electric force is a measure of the acceleration of the particles.\nThe greater the magnitude of the electric force between two particles, the more strongly the electric force pulls or pushes on the particles.
