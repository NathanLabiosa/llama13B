This probability is given by the formula:\nquantum efficiency = probability of detecting a photon / probability of a photon hitting the detector\nIf a photon detector has a quantum efficiency of 0.1, then the detector has a 10% chance of detecting a photon that hits it.\nTo calculate the expected value (average) number of times a detector will detect photons, consider that the quantum efficiency of a photon detector is 0.1. This means that the detector has a 10% chance of detecting a photon that hits it.\nIf 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, the detector will detect photons. The expected value is 10 times, which is the average number of times the detector will detect photons.\nTo calculate the root mean square deviation (rms) from the expected value, consider that the expected value is 10 times. The root mean square deviation is a measure of the spread of the data. It can be calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squared deviations from the expected value.\nFor this distribution, the average of the squared deviations from the expected value is 0.3. So, the root mean square deviation is about 0.3."}

The mass of three helium atoms is 0.0078 times the mass of one helium atom.\nSo, the energy produced is 0.00256 times the mass of two hydrogen atoms times c^2, which is equal to 0.00256 times the mass of two hydrogen atoms times 9.01 x 10^16 meters per second squared, or 2.56 x 10^13 meters per second squared. This is the energy produced per gram of hydrogen.\nTo figure out how much energy is produced per second, divide by the mass of the Sun:\n2.56 x 10^13 meters per second squared / 1.989 x 10^30 kilograms = 1.28 x 10^6 meters per second squared.\nThis is the average energy produced per second per gram of hydrogen.

One way to do this is to measure the change in the concentration of one of the particles involved in the reaction.\nImagine a reaction in which particles of a certain isotope are produced. The concentration of the isotope will increase during the reaction. So, by measuring the concentration of the isotope, you can calculate the rate of the reaction.\nTo determine how long the reaction takes to complete, you need to measure the time it takes for the concentration of the isotope to increase by a certain percentage. This measurement will give you the rate of the reaction.\nFor example, suppose you want to calculate the rate of a reaction in which the concentration of a certain isotope increases from 100 to 105 particles per milliliter. If the concentration increases by 5% during the reaction, then the reaction takes 10 minutes to complete.\nTo calculate the rate of the reaction, you can use the following formula:\nrate = (concentration final - concentration initial) / (time final - time initial)\nYou can use this formula to calculate the rate of the reaction described above. The concentration initial is 100 particles per milliliter, the concentration final is 105 particles per milliliter, and the time initial is not given, so you cannot use the formula to calculate the rate of the reaction.\nInstead, you can use the formula to calculate the time it takes for the concentration of the isotope to increase from 100 to 105 particles per milliliter.\nIf the concentration increases by 5% during the reaction, then the reaction takes 10 minutes to complete.\nTo estimate the uncertainty in your rate measurement, you need to determine how many significant figures the rate has. The rate has 3 significant figures.\nTo get a rate with 1 percent uncertainty, you can multiply the number you are given by 1.01. This will give you a rate with 2 significant figures, which is the number of significant figures the original rate has.\nSo, to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, you need to measure the concentration of the isotope for 80 seconds."}

Heat pumps can move heat energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer by using work.\nWhen a heat pump is used to heat an outdoor environment, it must move heat energy from the indoor environment to the outdoor environment. To do this, the heat pump uses work. The amount of work that the heat pump needs to do is determined by the difference in temperature between the two environments and the number of joules of heat that the heat pump delivers to the outdoor environment.\nThe following equation shows the relationship between the amount of work that a heat pump does and the temperature difference and the amount of heat delivered:\nwork / amount of heat = (temperature difference / 15) - 1\nSOLUTION: To answer the question, use the equation above.\nThe temperature difference is 20\u00b0C.\nFor each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately 500 J.\nThis means that a heat pump needs to do 500 J of work to move 15,000 J of heat from the outdoor environment to the indoor environment."}

For a circular orbit, the angular momentum is given by the formula:\nangular momentum = mass x distance\nFor the two satellites, the distance is given by:\ndistance = R/2, where R is the orbital radius.\nSo, the angular momentum of each satellite is:\nA: angular momentum = (mass of A) x (R/2)\nB: angular momentum = (mass of B) x (R/2)\nSOLUTION: The mass of each satellite is equal to the ratio of their orbital radii. So, the angular momentum of A is:\nA: angular momentum = (2R/2) x (R/2) = R^2 / 2\nAnd the angular momentum of B is:\nB: angular momentum = (R/2) x (R/2) = R^2 / 4\nThe ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B is:\nA: angular momentum / B: angular momentum = R^2 / 2 / R^2 / 4 = sqrt(2)"}

If the particles stick together after the collision, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy that is lost is determined by the mass ratio.\nThe mass of the two particles is 2m and m, respectively. So, the fraction of the mass that is lost is m/2m = m/2.\nThe initial kinetic energy is 1/2(2m) = 1/2m. The fraction of this initial kinetic energy that is lost is 1/2m \\* m/2 = m/4.\nSOLUTION: The particles stick together after the collision, so all of the initial kinetic energy is lost. This is consistent with the fact that, when particles stick together, their final speed is zero."}

The angle at which the light is reflected is called the angle of reflection.\nThe angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. The angle of incidence is the angle at which the light strikes the boundary.\nSOLUTION: White light is a combination of many different colors, or wavelengths. When the light reaches the surface of the oil, it is reflected. The most strongly reflected wavelength is the wavelength for which the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\nFor a thin film of oil, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. So, the most strongly reflected wavelength is also the wavelength of the light that is normally incident on the oil/water interface.\nWhen light is normally incident on a surface, the angle of incidence is 0. The only wavelength that produces an angle of reflection equal to 0 is the wavelength that is reflected at a 0-degree angle.\nThis happens when the wavelength is equal to the thickness of the oil film.\n500 nm is equal to the thickness of the oil film. So, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 500 nm."}

An object's acceleration is a change in its velocity.\nAn object undergoes acceleration in the presence of a net force. For the object, the stronger the net force is, the more quickly the object's velocity will change.\nSOLUTION: The payload is dropped from a height of 0 m, so it starts with a downward velocity of 0 m/s. The only net force acting on the payload is gravity, which pulls downward. So, the payload has an acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2 downward.\nThe velocity of the payload 4.0 s after it is released is given by the following formula:\nv = v0 + at\nWhere v0 is the initial velocity (0 m/s downward), a is the acceleration (9.8 m/s^2 downward), and t is the time (4.0 s).\nPlugging in the values, you get:\nv = 0 m/s downward + (9.8 m/s^2 downward) \u00d7 4.0 s\nv = 40 m/s downward."}

The possible values of n are 1, 2, and 3.\nWhen n is 3, the positronium atom is in its highest energy state. An atom in its highest energy state emits photons when it makes a transition to a lower energy state.\nThe energy of a photon is determined by the difference in energy between the two states. The transition from the n=3 state to the n=1 state involves a decrease in energy. So, the photon emitted in this transition has a lower energy than the photon emitted in the transition from the n=3 state to the n=2 state.\nThe energy of the photon emitted in the transition from the n=3 state to the n=1 state is closest to 6.0 eV."}

So, the time is proportional to R."}
