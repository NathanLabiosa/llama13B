So, a completely submerged object always displaces its own weight in the fluid.\nThe volume of a substance is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the volume of a small car is about 1,500 liters. In scientific notation, 1,500 is written as 1.5 x 10^3.\nThe density of a substance is a very large quantity as well. Like volumes, densities are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the density of iron is about 7.8 x 10^3 kg/m^3. In scientific notation, 7.8 x 10^3 is written as 7.8 x 10^3.\nSOLUTION: A completely submerged object displaces its own weight in the fluid. So, the weight of fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object.\nAccording to the formula, the weight of a object is equal to the object's volume times its density. So, to figure out the weight of fluid displaced, you need to use the formula with the density of the fluid.\nA completely submerged object's volume is equal to the object's volume. So, the weight of fluid displaced is equal to the object's volume times the fluid's density."}

This can be seen in the equation for the gravitational field, which shows that spacetime is curved by the presence of mass.\nThe curvature of spacetime is what causes gravity. In curved spacetime, objects move along geodesics, which are the shortest paths between two points. If an object follows a geodesic, it will move along a straight path. If it moves along a straight path, it will not accelerate. So, in curved spacetime, objects do not accelerate.

Astronomers use spectroscopy to sort stars based on their spectra.\nSpectral lines are specific colors, or wavelengths, that are emitted by an object. Spectral lines can reveal information about the object's temperature, density, and chemical composition.\nScientists can use the spectral lines of stars to determine the stars' temperatures. Hot stars have sharp, narrow spectral lines. Cool stars have broader, fainter lines.\nSOLUTION: The positions of spectral lines in an object's spectrum are determined by the object's temperature.\nHotter objects have shorter wavelengths in their spectra, while cooler objects have longer wavelengths. This means that the spectral lines of hotter objects are positioned closer to the blue end of the spectrum, while the spectral lines of cooler objects are positioned closer to the red end of the spectrum.\nThe amplitude of a wave is a measure of its maximum displacement from its average value. The higher the amplitude of the wave, the higher the intensity of the emitted light.\nSo, spectral lines are positioned by amplitude. This means that the higher the amplitude of the underlying wave, the higher the position of the spectral line in the spectrum.\nSOLUTION: The phases of two waves tell you how the waves are related to each other. One wave can be a multiple of the other wave.\nThe spectral lines of different elements are always in the same relative positions in an object's spectrum.

But some of the radiation reaches space, taking thermal energy with it.\nConduction and convection are types of heat transfer. They occur when there is a difference in temperature between two substances. In conduction, the substances are in direct contact. In convection, the substances are not in direct contact. Instead, the substances are separated by a medium that is heated by one of the substances and rises, carrying the heat with it.\nRadioactivity is a type of radiation.

Isotopes of a element are different forms of the element. Isotopes have the same number of protons, but a different number of neutrons.\nThe protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom make up its atomic mass. The greater the ratio of neutrons to protons in an atom's nucleus, the more massive the atom is. Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons. So, the atomic mass of an isotope is different from the atomic mass of other isotopes of the same element.\nThorium-238 has 2 more neutrons in its nucleus than uranium-238.

This means that the higher the frequency of the sound, the higher the speed of sound.\nThe speed of sound in air is also affected by the temperature of the air. The warmer the air, the higher the speed of sound.\nSOLUTION: Look at the choices.\nThe frequency of a sound is determined by its wavelength. So, the speed of sound in air depends on both frequency and wavelength.\nWavelength is inversely proportional to frequency. This means that as the frequency of the sound increases, the wavelength of the sound decreases.\nSo, the speed of sound in air depends on both the frequency and the wavelength of the sound."}

When an atom emits an alpha particle, it becomes an atom of a different element with the same number of protons, but a different number of neutrons.\nFor example, uranium-238 (U-238) is a chemical element.

This high specific heat can play a role in regelation.\nWhen water is frozen, it has a high heat capacity, which means it takes a lot of heat to change the temperature of the water from its frozen state to its liquid state. So, when a substance that is colder than water comes into contact with water, the substance may not have enough heat to raise the temperature of the water to its melting point. In this case, the substance will not melt. Instead, it will stay in a solid state at or near the freezing point of water. This is regelation.\nOpen-structured ice crystals can also play a role in regelation. Open-structured ice crystals have spaces between the crystals. When a substance that is colder than water comes into contact with open-structured ice crystals, the substance may not have enough heat to melt the ice crystals. So, the substance will freeze and fill the spaces between the ice crystals. This can form a layer of ice on the surface of the water.\nThe rate of expansion of water when it freezes is also important in regelation. When water freezes, it expands. So, if water is in a container, the water will expand and try to fill any space in the container. If a substance that is colder than water comes into contact with the water in the container, the substance may not have enough heat to melt the water. So, the substance will freeze and fill any space in the container. This can form a layer of ice on the surface of the water.\nA substance's tendency to freeze when its temperature is lowered depends on the substance's temperature. Substances that have a lower temperature than water will freeze when they come into contact with water. So, a substance's tendency to freeze when its temperature is lowered has nothing to do with regelation.\nSOLUTION: Look at the table:\nRegelation | Cooling\nIce crystal structure | Open-structured, long, thin\nHeat capacity | High\nSpecific heat | High\nRate of expansion | High\nTendency to freeze | High\nSo, water has a high specific heat, open-structured ice crystals, and a high rate of expansion. These are important factors in regelation."}

To find the value of the length of the tube at a specific frequency, you can use the following formula:\nL = 1/4nL0\nwhere L is the length of the tube, n is the frequency of the wave, and L0 is the length of the tube when it is not vibrating.\nFor a tube closed at one end, n is equal to 256. To find the value of L, you can use the formula above with n=256.\nL = 1/4 x 256L0\nL0 is the length of the tube when it is not vibrating. So, for a tube closed at one end, the length at a frequency of 256 Hz is one-quarter the value for a tube open at both ends."}

The element with the same number of protons as the nucleus of an atom is that atom's element.\nSOLUTION: Neon-20 has 10 protons and 10 neutrons in its nucleus. So, neon-20 is the element.\nIf two protons and two neutrons are removed from neon-20, a nucleus with 8 protons and 10 neutrons remains. This is the nucleus of magnesium-22.\nMagnesium-22 is the element."}

This energy is released in the form of motion of the fission fragments and photons.\nBecause the mass of the fission fragments is equal to the mass of the original nucleus minus the mass of the energy released, the mass of the fission fragments per nucleon is either greater or less than the mass of the original nucleus per nucleon.\nSOLUTION: An iron nucleus (Fe) with 26 nucleons has more mass per nucleon than a nucleus with 26 nucleons that is not iron. So, if an iron nucleus splits into two fragments, both fragments will have more mass per nucleon than a nucleus with 26 nucleons that is not iron.\nThe energy released when an iron nucleus splits into two fragments is about 200 million times greater than the energy released when a nitrogen-14 nucleus (N-14) splits into two fragments.

When this happens, the waves can combine to form a new wave. The result is a change in the amplitude of the new wave.\nDiffraction occurs when a wave passes through a small opening. As the wave passes through the opening, it spreads out. This spreading is diffraction.\nDiffraction gratings use diffraction to split a beam of light into its component colors. A diffraction grating is a pattern of lines that are pitched at a specific angle. The lines act as a series of narrow slits. When light passes through the grating, it diffracts, or spreads out, into its component colors.\nThe angle at which the lines are pitched is called the d-spot angle. The d-spot angle tells you what colors the diffraction grating will produce.\nSOLUTION: A diffraction grating relies on diffraction.

This means that when a metal object is placed in a magnetic field and the magnetic field strength changes, an electric current will be induced in the metal object.\nOhm's law states that the electric current through a conductor is equal to the voltage across the conductor divided by the resistance of the conductor. This means that the electric current in a metal object can be measured by applying a voltage to the object and measuring the resulting current.\nSOLUTION: To describe how metal detectors work, you need to know how they use electricity. Ohm's law can describe how electric current and voltage relate to each other in a conductor.\nWhen a metal object is placed in an magnetic field, the magnetic field strength changes. According to Faraday's law, this change in magnetic field strength can induce an electric current in the metal object. The electric current can be measured by applying a voltage to the metal object and measuring the resulting current.\nThe voltage needed to measure the electric current is equal to the product of the electric current and the resistance of the metal object. This voltage is known as the voltage drop.\nThe voltage drop is a measure of the change in the electric potential of the metal object. The greater the electric current flowing through the metal object, and the higher the resistance of the metal object, the more strongly the magnetic field affects the metal object, and the more strongly the electric potential of the metal object is changed.\nSo, metal detectors can use Faraday's law to detect changes in the magnetic field caused by metal objects.

The higher the pitch of the note, the higher the frequency of the note.\nThe frequency of a piano note is determined by the frequency of the tuning fork that is used to tune the note. If a tuning fork vibrates at the same rate as a piano note, the tuning fork is said to be tuned to the note.\nThe table below shows the frequencies of some piano notes and the tuning forks that are tuned to those notes.\n | Tuning Fork | Frequency |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| F2 | 358 Hz |\n| F#2 | 370 Hz |\n| G2 | 392 Hz |\n| G#2 | 411 Hz |\n| A2 | 440 Hz |\n| A#2 | 462 Hz |\n| B2 | 485 Hz |\n| C3 | 523 Hz |\n| C#3 | 554 Hz |\n| D4 | 587 Hz |\n| D#4 | 622 Hz |\n| E5 | 658 Hz |\n| F6 | 698 Hz |\nThe frequency of a note is higher than the frequency of a tuning fork that is tuned to the note.
