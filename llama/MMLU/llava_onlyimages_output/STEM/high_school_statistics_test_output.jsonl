This means that the outcomes can be mapped to numbers.\nFor example, if you roll a die, the outcomes are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. These numbers are numerical.\nThe possible outcomes of a discrete random variable must be mutually exclusive. This means that each outcome is unique.\nFor example, if you roll a die, the outcomes are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. These outcomes are mutually exclusive.\nThe mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability.\nThis statement applies to all discrete random variables.\nFor example, if you roll a die, the expected value is 3.5. This means that, on average, the die will land on 3.5. You can use the following formula to calculate the expected value of a discrete random variable:\nexpected value = sum(value \u00d7 probability)\nFor a die, the values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

{"question": "Which of the following is a true statement about hypothesis testing?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered."}, {"label": "C", "text": "If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Hypothesis testing is a process that can be used to test whether an assumption is true. This process begins with a null hypothesis, which is a statement that the assumption is true. Then, data is gathered and analyzed to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. A hypothesis test can be conducted at any level of significance, or probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. The level of significance is chosen before the test is conducted.\nThe power of a test is a measure of the probability that the test will detect an effect if the alternative hypothesis is true. This power is a function of the level of significance and the effect size. The higher the level of significance and the larger the effect size, the more powerful the test is.\nIf there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level. This means that a test with a 10% level of significance can detect effects that a test with a 5% level of significance could miss.\nWhether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered. A one-sided test is used when the researcher is interested in whether the null hypothesis is true on one side of the sampling distribution. A two-sided test is used when the researcher is interested in whether the null hypothesis is true on both sides of the sampling distribution.\nIf a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. This chance is equal to the level of significance.\nThe power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis. A test with a high power will detect a large effect with a high probability."}

And if you are using a statistical test to detect outliers, the test may be misled by a small number of outliers.\nOn the other hand, if you have a large data set and you ignore outliers, you may miss important information.\nSOLUTION: An outlier is an observation that is seen less frequently than the other observations in the data set. If an observation is seen less frequently than the other observations, it is a outlier."}

For example, an experiment can be designed to determine whether a new drug is effective at treating a disease. In this case, the experiment would have two groups of patients: one group would receive the new drug, and the other would receive a placebo.\nBefore the experiment begins, the researchers decide on a significance level, or alpha level. The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, true. The most common significance level is 0.05, which means that the researchers decide to accept the null hypothesis if the probability of a Type I error is 5% or less.\nA Type I error is a mistake of the first kind. It occurs when the researchers reject the null hypothesis, and it is not true. In the experiment described above, a Type I error would occur if the researchers conclude that the new drug is effective when, in fact, it is not.\nA Type II error is a mistake of the second kind. It occurs when the researchers do not reject the null hypothesis, and it is not true. In the experiment described above, a Type II error would occur if the researchers conclude that the new drug is not effective when, in fact, it is.\nThe power of a test is a measure of the probability that the test will detect a true effect. A test with a high power will have a high probability of detecting a true effect.\nSOLUTION: The power of a test depends on the probability of a Type II error. So, if the probability of a Type II error decreases, the power of the test will increase.\nThe probability of a Type II error is affected by the number of experimental units. The larger the number of experimental units for each treatment, the higher the probability that the test will detect a true effect.

Experiments can investigate whether these variables have a specific outcome. For example, an experiment can investigate whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil was the variable. The height of the pea plants was the outcome.\nExperimental designs include types of experiments called randomized experiments and observational studies. Randomized experiments investigate whether a variable has a specific outcome. Participants in a randomized experiment are assigned to groups.\nThe groups receive different levels of the variable. Then, researchers measure the outcome for each group.\nIn contrast, observational studies investigate how a variable affects an outcome. In observational studies, researchers observe how different groups of participants are affected by the variable.\nFor example, an observational study might investigate whether listening to music affects reading comprehension. Students who listen to music while reading and students who do not listen to music are compared on their reading comprehension.\nIn both experimental designs, the goal is to find out whether a variable has a specific outcome. However, in randomized experiments, participants are assigned to groups. This allows researchers to conclude that any differences in outcomes between groups were caused by the variable.\nIn contrast, in observational studies, researchers observe differences between groups. This can make it difficult to conclude that any differences in outcomes between groups were caused by the variable.\nSOLUTION: In this study, subjects were given three beers to consume. Their reaction time was measured before and after drinking the alcohol.\nThis study was an experiment. It had a variable (drinking the beers) and measured an outcome (reaction time).\nThe study was designed to investigate whether alcohol affects reaction time. By measuring reaction time before and after drinking the beers, the study was able to conclude that alcohol does affect reaction time.\nLack of blocking makes this a poorly designed study.\nBlocking is the process of making sure that each subject is only measured under one condition. In this study, subjects were not blocked. This means that each subject's reaction time was measured under two conditions: before and after drinking the beers.\nThis lack of blocking means that the study cannot conclude that any effect of the beers on reaction time was due to the alcohol. It is possible that a placebo effect, or the effect of being in the study, had an effect on reaction time.\nThe placebo effect is irrelevant in this type of study.\nIn this type of study, the placebo effect is not important. The placebo effect occurs when people improve simply because they are in a study. Since this study investigated a change in reaction time due to alcohol, the placebo effect is not relevant.\nThis study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls.\nExperiments can include multiple groups. In the study described above, each subject's reaction time was measured before and after drinking the beers. The change in reaction time showed that alcohol affects reaction time.\nThis study was designed to investigate whether alcohol affects reaction time. By measuring reaction time before and after drinking the beers, the study was able to conclude that alcohol does affect reaction time."}

This means that, for large samples, the mean will be normally distributed.\nHowever, the Central Limit Theorem does not apply to proportions. Proportions are always between 0 and 1, which means that the sampling distribution of the proportion will always be bounded.\nMoreover, whether a procedure uses z or t will affect the values of the test statistic.\nIf a procedure uses z, the test statistic will be based on the standard score for proportions, which is the z-score.\nIf a procedure uses t, the test statistic will be based on the t-score for proportions, which is the t-score.\nBoth the z-score and the t-score have the same mean and standard deviation as the normal distribution. But, the z-score has a different standard score for proportions than the t-score does.\nSo, the choice of z or t affects the value of the test statistic."}

It states that the mean of the sampling distribution of x is equal to the mean of the population, and that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x is equal to the standard deviation of x divided by the square root of the sample size.\nThe central limit theorem tells you that as the sample size grows larger, the distribution of the sample means becomes normal.

Each sample is used to estimate a population parameter. For example, if you want to estimate the average height of all people in a country, you can take a sample of people and calculate the average height of the sample. Then, you can use this sample mean to estimate the average height of the entire population.\nThe sample statistics, such as the sample mean, are used to estimate the population parameters. The sample mean is used to estimate the population mean.\nHowever, the sample statistics are only estimates. They may be different from the true population parameters. The difference between the sample statistics and the true population parameters is called sampling error.\nThere are many ways in which sampling error can occur. Here are some of the most common factors that can cause sampling error:\ninterviewers make mistakes, leading to bias\nthe sample is too small\nthe population is not representative\nthe sample is not random\nthe interviewers use judgment when picking the sample\nWhen a sample is too small, it can lead to high sampling error. This is because small samples have a wider range of values. So, the difference between the sample statistics and the true population parameters can be larger."}

It is a way to use the relationship between the variables to predict values of the response variable.\nIn a regression analysis, the goal is to choose the explanatory variables that have the most predictive power. One way to measure the predictive power of an explanatory variable is to look at the strength of the linear relationship between the variable and the response variable.\nThe strength of the linear relationship between two variables is called their correlation. Correlation can be measured using the correlation coefficient, which has a range from -1 to +1:\nA correlation coefficient of +1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables. This means that the variables increase together.\nA correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a strong negative linear relationship between the two variables. This means that the variables decrease together.\nA correlation coefficient of 0 indicates that the two variables are not linearly related.\nSOLUTION: The correlation coefficient is represented by the r-squared value. The r-squared value from the regression analysis was 0.981, or 98.1%. This means that 98.1% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.\nSo, there is a strong positive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables. And, about 98% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable."}

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. In this case, the fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating. The number of tomatoes is the variable that you are investigating. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the variable whose effect you are investigating is fertilizer. And, the variable that you are investigating is the number of tomatoes. These two variables are called the dependent and independent variables, respectively.\nThere are several things that can affect the results of an experiment. These things are called confounding variables. Controlling for confounding variables means that you eliminate or remove their effects on the dependent variable. This helps you to see how the independent variable affects the dependent variable.\nControl of confounding variables is important in the design of experiments.\nRandomization is the process of assigning subjects to treatments by chance. In a experiment with two or more treatments, randomization can help to make sure that each treatment has a similar number of subjects. This can help to ensure that any differences between the treatments are due to the actual treatments and not to the way the subjects were assigned to treatments.\nUse of a confounding variable to control the placebo effect is not a reason to use randomization in assigning subjects to different treatments.\nReplication of the experiment using sufficient numbers of subjects is important in the design of experiments. Replication means running the experiment multiple times and using data from each run to estimate the effect of the independent variable. Replication can help to increase the reliability of the experiment's results."}

For example, researchers who want to find out whether a certain drug improves cognitive performance can give the drug to a group of participants and compare their performance to that of a group that does not get the drug.\nIn surveys, researchers use already-defined groups, and they need to consider the effects of confounding factors. For example, a survey that aims to find out whether children who do not watch television have higher cognitive performance than children who do watch television is designed to compare the performance of these two groups. But, children who do not watch television may have parents with different values regarding educational investment.\nSo, surveys can be influenced by confounding factors. For example, households with more money may be more likely to complete a survey. This could lead to biased results, as the results may reflect the views of households with more money, rather than the views of the whole population.\nTo reduce the effects of confounding factors in surveys, researchers use techniques such as randomization and stratification. These techniques can help ensure that the groups are comparable.\nSOLUTION: A simple random sample is a group of individuals selected in such a way that each individual has an equal chance of being selected. So, the study is designed well with respect to chance.\nThe response rate is the percentage of individuals who complete the survey. A response rate of 86% is high. So, the study is designed well with respect to the response rate.\nSelection bias occurs when the individuals in a group are not similar to the individuals in the population. So, the study may be designed poorly with respect to selection bias.\nA voluntary response study is a study in which individuals decide for themselves whether to participate. These types of studies can be influenced by selection bias. So, voluntary response studies can give too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions."}

Experimental designs are ways to perform experiments. One way to design an experiment is to use a randomized controlled trial. In a randomized controlled trial, participants are assigned to groups by chance.\nOne of the benefits of a randomized controlled trial is that it helps to avoid bias. A randomized controlled trial is a type of experiment. Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether a variable has an effect. For example, you might want to find out whether adding a fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. In this case, the variable is the fertilizer. The effect of the fertilizer is the change in pea plant height.\nOne of the ways to design an experiment is to investigate one group of pea plants at a time. You can investigate the effect of adding fertilizer to soil by growing one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measuring the height of the plants. Then, you can grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants.\nAnother way to design an experiment is to investigate both groups of pea plants at the same time.

These factors are called confounding factors, or factors that can make it seem like one of the parts of the study is affecting the outcome, when it is actually the confounding factor.\nOne way to deal with confounding factors is to assign participants randomly to groups. This way, the groups are balanced with respect to the confounding factors. For example, if you want to study the effect of caffeine on sleep, you could assign participants to groups so that each group has the same number of sleepy people.\nAnother way to deal with confounding factors is to select groups that are already balanced with respect to the confounding factors. For example, you could study two groups of people: drinkers and nondrinkers. These groups are already balanced with respect to caffeine use.\nBlocking is a type of randomization that involves selecting groups of participants from smaller units, such as classes or departments. This method is particularly useful for oversampling certain groups. For example, if you want to study the effect of a new drug on men and women, you could select each group (men and women) from a smaller unit that is already balanced with respect to gender, such as a class at a women's college.\nSOLUTION: A randomized block design is a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups using a randomized algorithm that takes into account the associations between the confounding factors and the outcome.\nThe purpose of blocking is to make the groups balanced with respect to the confounding factors. So, you should block on the factors that are associated with the outcome.\nExercise is associated with cholesterol level.

You can design an experiment to investigate whether one variable has an effect on another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out whether fertilizer has an effect on the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables. The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was not associated with the number of tomatoes. So, changing the amount of fertilizer added to the soil did not affect the number of tomatoes.\nOther things that affect the number of tomatoes include the type of tomato plant, the location of the plant, and the amount of water the plant receives. These things are called confounding variables because they can affect the number of tomatoes without affecting the effect of fertilizer.\nExperiments can be designed to avoid confounding variables. One way to do this is to hold confounding variables constant. For example, to find out whether fertilizer has an effect on tomatoes, you could investigate plants that are identical in all other ways.\nAnother way to design experiments is to measure and control the confounding variables. For example, you could measure the effect of fertilizer on tomatoes in plants grown in sandy soil versus clay soil.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether taking fish oil capsules or garlic capsules has more of an effect on cholesterol levels, you need to find out whether cholesterol level is associated with capsule type.\nYou can do this by comparing the cholesterol levels of people who take fish oil capsules to the cholesterol levels of people who take garlic capsules.\nFirst, choose a baseline cholesterol level. A baseline cholesterol level is a cholesterol level that is not affected by the capsules. You can use a past study to help you choose a baseline cholesterol level.\nThen, block, or hold constant, the effect of the capsules by having people take the capsules for a month.\nFinally, compare the cholesterol levels of the people who took fish oil capsules to the cholesterol levels of the people who took garlic capsules. This will tell you whether taking fish oil capsules or garlic capsules has more of an effect on cholesterol levels."}

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. In this case, fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating. The number of tomatoes is the variable that you are investigating.\nExperiments have two groups of units. One group of units is exposed to the variable whose effect you are investigating, while the other is not. Then, you measure the effect of the variable by comparing the results from the two groups.\nExamples of experiments with two groups include studies that compare the test scores of students who study using different textbooks, and studies that compare the survival rates of plants grown in different soil types.\nExamples of experiments with more than two groups include studies that compare the test scores of students who study using different textbooks, and studies that compare the health outcomes of people who take different drugs.\nSOLUTION: A factor is a type of variable. It is a response variable because its value can be affected by the treatment.\nExamples of factors include the effect of adding fertilizer to soil on tomato plant height, and the effect of different teaching methods on student test scores.\nExperimental units are the animals, plants, or objects that are studied in an experiment. They are also called subjects.\nExamples of experimental units include tomatoes, trees, and rats.\nExperimental units are assigned to groups. Each group is exposed to a different treatment.\nLevels are the different treatment options. In the experiment described above, each group of tomato plants was grown in a different type of soil.\nExamples of levels include different types of fertilizer, and different teaching methods.\nReplication means that the experiment is repeated multiple times. Each replication may have its own set of experimental units.\nBy replicating an experiment, you can get a more accurate measure of the effect of the variables.

Power is important because it reflects the test's ability to measure the effect size of a treatment.\nPower is determined by the significance level, alpha, and the sample size, n. For a given set of values of alpha and n, the greater the effect size of the treatment, the higher the power of the test.\nSOLUTION: The greatest power for a test is achieved when the test is most likely to detect a true difference if one exists. This occurs when the effect size of the treatment is greatest.\nFor a given sample size, the effect size is determined by the difference between the two groups' means and the magnitude of the sampling variability.\nThe magnitude of the sampling variability is determined by the significance level. A lower significance level requires a smaller difference between the two groups' means to achieve statistical significance. So, for a given sample size, a lower significance level results in a higher power test.\nFor a given significance level, the effect size is determined by the magnitude of the difference between the two groups' means and the sample size.

This is important because many statistical tests use the normal distribution as a basis for their conclusions.\nIf the standard deviation of the original population is known, the sample size, n, can be determined by the desired precision of the sample mean. A larger sample size will give a more precise estimate of the population mean.\nIf n is large, no matter what the distribution of the original population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be close to the normal distribution. This is the central limit theorem.\nIf the value of n is small and the distribution of the original population is not normal, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will not be close to normal. In this case, you may not be able to use the central limit theorem to calculate a confidence interval.\nNo matter what the value of n or what the distribution of the original population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will tell you how the sample means behave on average. This means that you can use the sampling distribution to calculate the probability that a specific sample mean will fall between two values. For example, you could calculate the probability that a sample mean will fall between 0 and 1, or the probability that a sample mean will be less than 0.5."}

It is up to you to decide which null hypothesis to test.\nOne way to decide which null hypothesis to test is to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nThe null hypothesis for this experiment could be that growing plants in different soil types does not affect plant height.\nThe independent variable is the soil type.

You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.\nFor example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:\nYou grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.\nYou grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.\nBy comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude that adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.\nExamples of experiments include studies of the effects of adding fertilizer to soil, of giving a new medication to people, or of adding extra thermal insulation to houses.\nExamples of observational studies include studies of people's diets and cancer rates, or studies of how many hours people spend watching television and how often they get cancer.\nIn an observational study, you don't use variables to investigate a question. Instead, you observe how things are different between groups.\nFor example, an observational study might compare people who watch more television to people who watch less television, to see whether there is a relationship between television watching and cancer."}

This interval tells you that you can be 95% confident that the true average height of adults in the population is between 172.5 cm and 177.5 cm.\nThe width of a confidence interval depends on the number of observations in the sample. The wider the confidence interval, the less confident you can be that the true population parameter is within the interval.\nA narrower confidence interval is usually better, but it requires a larger sample size. For example, consider the two intervals:\n175 cm +/\u2013 2.5 cm and 75 cm +/\u2013 1.5 cm.\nThe second interval is narrower than the first. But the first interval is 95% confident, and the second interval is only 80% confident.\nSo, a larger sample size is needed to get a narrower confidence interval.\nSOLUTION: To get a 90% confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08, use the following formula:\nn = (3.07/0.08)^2 \\* 270\nn = 64\nSo, you need to sample 64 students to get a 90% confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08."}

In other words, power is a measure of the test's ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.\nThere are two types of errors that can occur with a significance test:\nType I error: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, true. This type of error is also called a false positive.\nType II error: The probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, false.
