Second messengers can either stimulate or inhibit the activity of proteins. Second messengers are called \"second\" because they follow \"first\" messengers, which are outside signals that activate the first messengers.\nCalcium ions (Ca2+) are one type of first messenger. When calcium ions are needed elsewhere in the cell, they can stimulate the release of second messengers. One such second messenger is inositol triphosphate (IP3). IP3 stimulates the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum.\nAnother second messenger that stimulates the release of calcium ions is cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP does this by activating a protein called calmodulin. Calmodulin can stimulate the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum.\nProstaglandins are not second messengers. Prostaglandins are a group of signaling molecules that are involved in many different cellular processes.\nCalmodulin is a second messenger. Calmodulin can stimulate the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum."}

These fungi colonize the roots of plants, and the fungal hyphae help the plant acquire water and nutrients from the soil.\nOne of the benefits of mycorrhizal fungi to plants is that they can help the plant access phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils. This can be a particular advantage in soils that are deficient in phosphorus.\nNitrogen is an essential element that many plants need to grow. Nitrogen is often limited in soil, and plants can have difficulty obtaining it. Mycorrhizal fungi can help plants obtain nitrogen by fixing it. Nitrogen fixation is the process of converting nitrogen gas, which plants cannot use, into a form of nitrogen that plants can use.\nMany plants grow in dry habitats, and desert plants often have to cope with extreme water stress. The hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi can help alleviate water stress by absorbing water from the soil and releasing it to the plant.\nCarbon is an essential element for plants, and plants need it to do photosynthesis.

In ferns, the dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte.\nThe dominant sporophyte produces spores that give rise to the gametophyte. The gametophyte is the independent stage of the life cycle, meaning it can produce eggs and sperm. When the gametophyte produces eggs and sperm, it is called the sexual stage.\nAfter the sexual stage, the eggs and sperm fuse to form a zygote. The zygote grows into a dominant sporophyte. The dominant sporophyte produces spores, but not until it has grown and developed for a while.\nSo, a dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte. The dominant sporophyte grows and develops, and then produces spores that give rise to a gametophyte. The gametophyte is independent because it can produce eggs and sperm."}

It is made of thick and thin filaments.\nThe thick filaments are made of myosin. The thin filaments are made of actin and tropomyosin.\nAt the center of the myosin filament are four myosin heads. The myosin heads have an actin-binding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site.\nTroponin is a complex of three proteins: troponin C, troponin T, and tropomyosin. Troponin T has an ATP-hydrolyzing site and a actin-binding site.\nWhen a muscle is stimulated to contract, calcium ions bind to troponin C. This binds troponin T to the actin-binding site of myosin. This allows the myosin heads to attach to the actin.\nAfter the myosin heads have attached to the actin, they can pull the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere. This causes the sarcomere to shorten."}

In other words, an embryologist can use an organism's development to learn about its evolutionary history.\nThis idea was proposed by Ernst Haeckel in 1873. Haeckel noticed that embryos of many animal species go through stages that resemble the adult forms of other animal species. For example, embryos of many vertebrates have gill slits at one stage of development. Haeckel proposed that this recapitulation of adult forms took place during the embryo's development.\nHowever, subsequent research has shown that Haeckel exaggerated the extent of recapitulation. Some similarities between embryos of different species are due to the shared ancestry of those species. But many similarities are due to the fact that similar structures have been favored by evolution.\nNonetheless, embryologists still use the concept of recapitulation to describe the stages of an organism's development. For example, an embryologist might refer to the stage in an embryo's development when it has gill slits as the \"fish stage.\"\nThe first stage of an embryo's development is the zygote stage. A zygote is a fertilized egg.\nEarly embryos display identical features of their class, order, and species. A class is a group of organisms. An order is a group of one or more classes. A species is a group of very similar organisms.\nScientists use these terms to describe organisms that have many traits in common. The traits must include both body parts and behaviors.\nAn early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos. This conclusion is based on research. Scientists have compared the development of human embryos to the development of embryos of other organisms.\nA human embryo displays features of adult fish and birds in the course of its development. This conclusion is based on research. Scientists have described the stages of human embryonic development in detail."}

Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.\nFossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. These rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an old rock sequence are pushed down to form a rock called sedimentary rock.\nThe type of fossils that are found in a rock sequence can tell you the organisms that lived during that time. Fossils of body parts that are found in a rock sequence are called body fossils. Footprints and burrows are examples of body fossils.\nFossils of organisms' activities are called trace fossils. Hieroglyphics are a type of trace fossil.\nHere are three ways in which fossils can form:\nA body fossil is a fossil that is formed from the remains of an organism's body.\nA trace fossil is a fossil that is formed from the remains of an organism's activities.\nA mold fossil is a fossil that is formed from the remains of an organism's body that have been replaced by mineral deposits.\nSOLUTION: The discovery of fossils is what started scientists on the path to understanding how species change over time. In 1656, the English scientist Robert Hooke was the first to use the term fossil. He called fossils \"the remains of organisms that had lived a long time ago.\"\nThe remains of organisms that did not have hard parts, such as body parts, were not fossilized. So, for a long time, fossils were the remains of animals and plants with hard parts.\nIn 1859, Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. In this book, Darwin described a mechanism for how species change over time. He did not discuss fossils. But his book provided a framework for understanding how fossils could form.\nDarwin's book explained how a population's members can change over time. This change happens through the process of natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which some traits make an organism more likely to survive or reproduce. As a result, these traits become more common in a population.\nThe principles of natural selection that Darwin described in 1859 are called Mendelian principles today. They are based on the work of the botanist Gregor Mendel. Mendel's work was published in 1866.\nMendelian principles explain why some traits are dominant and others are recessive. They also explain why some versions of a trait are more common in a population than other versions. But Mendelian principles do not describe how a population's members change over time.\nThe fossil record is a record of the remains of ancient organisms. It shows how the diversity of life on earth has changed over time. So, the fossil record was established before 1859."}

In terms of pressures within the venous and arterial compartments, this transfer results in a decrease in venous pressure and an increase in arterial pressure.\nThe pressure within a compartment is determined by the amount of fluid in the compartment and the pressure exerted on the fluid. For a closed compartment, the pressure exerted on the fluid is equal to the height of the fluid in the compartment.\nSo, for the venous compartment, the decrease in pressure is caused by an increase in the height of the fluid in the venous compartment. This increase in height occurs because the volume of blood in the venous compartment increases by an amount equal to the stroke volume.\nFor the arterial compartment, the increase in pressure is caused by a decrease in the height of the fluid in the arterial compartment. This decrease in height occurs because the volume of blood in the arterial compartment increases by an amount equal to the stroke volume.\nSOLUTION: The transfer of a volume of blood equivalent to the stroke volume from the venous compartment to the arterial compartment causes a decrease in venous pressure and an increase in arterial pressure. These pressure changes are equal and opposite.\nThe pressure in each compartment remains equal throughout the transfer of blood. So, there is no change in pressure in either compartment."}

They represent about 80% of all plant species. Angiosperms have flowers and use their flowers to reproduce.\nOne of the characteristics of angiosperms is that they have flowers. Angiosperm flowers can have many different structures. But all angiosperm flowers have both male and female parts.\nAnother characteristic of angiosperms is that their seeds are enclosed in fruit. The fruit grows from the ovary of the flower. Each fruit grows from a pollinated flower.\nSome plants have ways to store sperm. The sperm can stay alive inside the plant for a long time. Angiosperms have pollen sacs. These pollen sacs can store sperm.\nAfter a pollen sac lands on a female part of the flower, the sperm can be released. The sperm can swim to the egg. This is called double fertilization.\nThe diagram below shows how angiosperm flowers can have both male and female parts. It also shows where pollen sacs are found.\nThere are many different types of flowers. But all angiosperm flowers have both male and female parts.\nSome flowers have more than two male parts. And some flowers have more than one ovary. But all angiosperm flowers have both male and female parts.\nSOLUTION: Double fertilization is a characteristic unique to angiosperms. The other choices are not characteristics unique to angiosperms."}

{"question": "A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack.

Osmotic pressure is a measure of the pressure required to stop a solute from diffusing into a cell.\nThe pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways. They undergo dehydration and shrink. When the pollen grains shrink, they may undergo plasmolysis, a process in which the cell membrane collapses. This process is driven by an increase in the osmotic pressure of the pollen grains.\nWhen the pollen grains rupture, their contents are released into the surrounding environment. The release of starch granules is triggered by the increase in osmotic pressure when the pollen grains are exposed to water. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack.\nIf the pollen grains were hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment, they would absorb water and swell.\nThe pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment. This means that the pollen grains were hypertonic. They underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents."}

The transpiration rate increases when the rate of evaporation from the leaves increases.\nSOLUTION: High relative humidity and wind increase the rate of transpiration from plants. When the air around the plants is high in relative humidity, the air is already saturated with water vapor. So, evaporation from the plants will be at a higher rate than if the air were at a lower relative humidity.\nWind also increases the rate of transpiration from plants. When wind blows over the plants, it increases the rate at which water vapor is carried away from the plants. This increases the rate of evaporation from the plants, which in turn increases the transpiration rate.\nHigh temperature and low relative humidity decrease the rate of transpiration from plants. High temperatures increase the rate of evaporation from the soil, which leads to a higher rate of water uptake by the plants. But high temperatures also increase the rate of evaporation from the plants. So, the transpiration rate is not as high at high temperatures as it would be if the temperature were lower.\nLow relative humidity decreases the rate of transpiration from plants. When the air around the plants is low in relative humidity, the air is not saturated with water vapor. So, evaporation from the plants will be at a lower rate than if the air were at a higher relative humidity."}

From an evolutionary perspective, the optimality theory can be represented by the idea that a trait will persist in an organism's genome if the benefits gained from the trait exceed the costs.\nThe text also introduces the concept of conditional rules, which are rules that determine whether a trait will increase the number of offspring an organism produces. These conditional rules can include both the benefits and the costs of a trait. The benefits and costs that are included in conditional rules can include effects that are both immediate and delayed.\nAn immediate effect of a trait is a change in an organism's fitness, or reproductive success. A delayed effect of a trait is a change in an organism's ability to survive or reproduce that is triggered by a change in the organism's environment.\nThe costs of a trait include both the immediate costs and the delayed costs. The immediate costs of a trait include the energy and physiological resources that are required to perform the trait. The delayed costs of a trait include the long-term effects of the trait on the organism's survival or reproduction.\nAn organism's relative fitness is a measure of the organism's fitness relative to the fitness of other organisms. This measure can include both the immediate effects of a trait and the delayed effects of a trait.\nThe optimality theory can be used to predict how natural selection will act on a trait. This theory can be applied to any trait, not just survival or reproduction.\nThe theory can be used to predict how natural selection will act on an organism's genome as a whole. This prediction is based on the theory that the genes in an organism's genome are included in the organism's genome because they increase the organism's relative fitness."}
{"question": "In the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase, the rate of reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol increases as the concentration of acetaldehyde is increased.

The word specific in this context means that the enzyme can bind to and catalyze the reaction of only one substrate.\nAn enzyme's specificity for a substrate is a result of the enzyme's structure. The substrate must fit into the enzyme's active site, the location on the enzyme where the substrate binds. The substrate also must trigger the correct movement of the enzyme's atoms to catalyze the reaction.\nSOLUTION: At the maximal rate of reaction, the enzyme is specific for acetaldehyde. And, in the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme is interacting with acetaldehyde molecules. So, nearly all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with acetaldehyde molecules.\nThe enzyme is no longer specific for acetaldehyde when the maximal rate of reaction is reached. At this point, the enzyme starts to interact with ethanol molecules. So, at the maximal rate of reaction, the enzyme is not specific for acetaldehyde.\nThe change in free energy of the reaction decreases as the reaction proceeds. This means that the reaction is favorable, or spontaneous.\nThe activation energy of the reaction decreases as the reaction proceeds. This means that the reaction becomes easier to proceed as the reaction progresses."}

The genotype contains information about the organism's genes, and genes contain information about the proteins that an organism produces.\nA phenotype is the observable trait of an organism. Some traits are affected by multiple genes. For example, an organism's height is affected by the genes it inherited from both its mother and its father. In these cases, the expression of the genes is affected by the organism's genotype.\nHow do mutations in an organism's DNA change its phenotype?\nA mutation in an organism's DNA can change a gene. These changes can affect the way the gene encodes a protein. If the change in the gene affects the protein that the gene encodes, then the phenotype of the organism will change.\nSOLUTION: A different polypeptide is produced.\nA mutation in a gene may change the way the gene encodes a protein. This change can affect the structure of the protein. And the function of a protein is affected by its structure. So, the change in the protein can change the organism's phenotype.\nThe polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA.\nThe polarity of a tRNA is the orientation of its nucleotides. This description refers to the way the nucleotides in the tRNA are arranged. The polarity of tRNA is opposite that of DNA. So, this change would change the way tRNA binds to DNA. But how tRNA binds to DNA does not affect the expression of a gene. So, a change in the polarity of tRNA does not explain how a mutation in a gene can change the expression of that gene.\nNucleic acids are methylated.\nNucleic acid methylation is the addition of a methyl group to a nucleotide. This can affect the way a gene is expressed. But this change does not change the sequence of nucleotides in a gene. So, nucleic acid methylation does not explain how a mutation in a gene can change the expression of that gene.\nThe gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction.\nThe direction that a gene is read in affects the sequence of the protein that the gene encodes. So, reading a gene in a different direction can change the protein that the gene encodes. But this change does not affect the sequence of nucleotides in the gene. So, reading a gene in a different direction does not explain how a mutation in a gene can change the expression of that gene."}

This happens because gene flow allows for the exchange of alleles, some of which may be deleterious.\nThe increased likelihood of speciation is a result of gene flow, but only in the long term. In the short term, gene flow can actually decrease the likelihood of speciation by increasing genetic homogeneity.\nDisruption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the metapopulation is a result of gene flow.

One important factor is the length of the day.\nPhotoperiod is the term used to describe how long a day is. In most temperate ecosystems, the length of the day changes throughout the year. So, photoperiod can be used to tell a plant what time of year it is.\nFlowering plants have a special mechanism for detecting photoperiod. One part of this mechanism is a set of photoreceptors, or light-sensitive molecules, that respond to different colors of light. These photoreceptors are located in the leaves.\nWhen the days get longer, the plants use this information to begin flowering. They can tell that it is time to reproduce.\nCircadian rhythm is the term used to describe the sleep-wake cycle of an organism. In plants, circadian rhythm can affect when they flower. But circadian rhythm is not the primary signal that triggers flowering in response to daylength.\nChanging air temperature can also affect when a plant flowers. But air temperature is not a reliable indicator of daylength. So, air temperature cannot be the most dependable signal that a plant in a temperate ecosystem could use to initiate flowering.\nAbscisic acid is a hormone that can affect when a plant flowers. The concentration of abscisic acid can change throughout the year. So, fluctuations in abscisic acid levels could be used to trigger flowering. But abscisic acid is not the most dependable signal that a plant in a temperate ecosystem could use to initiate flowering."}

One of the roles of the matrix is to provide a high-energy state for the molecules that will be used as a source of energy for the cell.\nMitochondria can alter their matrix pH to affect the rate of certain reactions. For example, if the matrix pH is higher, the rate of one reaction that produces ATP will be increased. If the matrix pH is lower, the rate of a different reaction that produces ATP will be increased.\nThe concentration of OH- in the mitochondria matrix can affect the matrix pH. As the concentration of OH- in the matrix increases, the matrix pH will decrease. So, if the low external pH increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix, the matrix pH will decrease.\nAn increase in the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix will increase the matrix pH. So, if the low external pH increases the acid concentration in the matrix, the matrix pH will increase.\nThe concentration of OH- in the mitochondria matrix can affect the rate of certain reactions.

So, if the low external pH increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix, the matrix pH will decrease.\nAn increase in the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix can affect the rate of certain reactions. As the OH- concentration in the matrix increases, the matrix pH will decrease. So, if the low external pH increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix, the matrix pH will decrease.\nSOLUTION: A decrease in the matrix pH increases the rate of certain reactions that produce ATP. So, the effect of a low external pH is to decrease the matrix pH.\nThere is a slope of a graph at the beginning of the reaction. The slope of a graph represents the change in the dependent variable for a change in the independent variable.

These responses are called fixed because they are triggered the same way every time the animal encounters that stimulus.\nFixed action patterns can include both motor responses and reflexes. A motor response is a behavior that requires the animal to move. A reflex is a rapid, automatic response that occurs in response to a stimulus.\nAn important feature of fixed action patterns is that they can be triggered by cues in the environment that do not require sensory processing by the animal. This means that the animal does not need to think about or decide how to respond to the stimulus. The response is triggered by a simple detection of the stimulus.\nAnother feature of fixed action patterns is that they are relatively inflexible. Once an animal has started to perform a fixed action pattern, it will usually continue to do so until the stimulus is no longer present.\nSOLUTION: A fixed action pattern occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life. This means that the animal has already encountered this stimulus before."}

These genes were first discovered in flies by Edward B. Lewis, who was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work.\nLewis found that mutations in homeotic genes could cause large parts of the fly's body to transform into other parts. For example, a mutation in one of the homeotic genes could cause the antennae to transform into legs.\nThese developmental defects are called homeotic transformations. They involve the mutual exchange of parts. For example, a transformation from an antenna to a leg might involve the exchange of a single segment.\nThe segments of an animal's body are a series of similar parts. In a healthy animal, each segment is the same from the head to the tail. For example, all of the legs of a fly are the same.\nMutations in homeotic genes can cause the segments to become disorganized. For example, a mutation in a homeotic gene might cause the first segment to transform into the second segment. This would change the identity of each segment.\nPolarity defects are not the same as homeotic transformations. In polarity defects, the segments are still organized in a series, but each segment is the opposite of what it should be. For example, the first segment might be on the second side of the animal.\nTumor formation in imaginal discs is not a result of a mutation in a homeotic gene. Imaginal discs are groups of cells that will eventually become parts of the animal's body. Tumor formation in imaginal discs can be caused by many things, including genetic mutations and exposure to chemicals."}

The simplification of an ecosystem can be described in terms of changes in species diversity and changes in the way species interact. For example, a disturbed ecosystem may have a smaller number of dominant species, and the interactions between species may be less complex.\nThe underlined part of the quote discusses the regulatory mechanisms that can keep population levels of a species at equilibrium. These mechanisms can include both density-dependent and density-independent factors. Density-dependent factors can regulate a species' population by affecting the survival or reproduction of the species. Density-independent factors can regulate a species' population by affecting its survival or reproduction without depending on the population's density.\nAccording to the quote, a given prey organism is subject to higher predation rates by more diverse predators in a disturbed ecosystem. This means that in a disturbed ecosystem, there may be more predators with a wider range of hunting strategies, which can increase predation rates on prey organisms.\nThe presence of predators can have a density-dependent effect on a prey organism's population. For example, predators can keep a prey organism's population at a lower equilibrium population size. So, in a disturbed ecosystem, a given prey organism is less likely to undergo a population surge.\nThe passage does not discuss the existence of large populations of a low number of species. So, the quote does not imply that large populations of a low number of species exist in a disturbed ecosystem."}

This shows that the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is best explained by crossing over."}

The planet's active carbon pools are those that are readily exchanged between Earth's systems.\nThe atmosphere is an active pool of carbon because carbon in the atmosphere is exchanged between the atmosphere and other systems.\nRain-forest vegetation is an active pool of carbon because the carbon in the vegetation is exchanged between the vegetation and the atmosphere.\nRecoverable fossil fuels are an active pool of carbon because the carbon in the fossil fuels is exchanged between the fossil fuels and the atmosphere.\nThe oceans are an active pool of carbon because the carbon in the oceans is exchanged between the oceans and the atmosphere.\nSOLUTION: The atmosphere is the largest active pool of carbon. Atmospheric carbon is exchanged between the atmosphere and other systems.\nThe oceans are the largest active pool of carbon. Like the atmosphere, the oceans are an active pool of carbon because carbon in the oceans is exchanged between the oceans and the atmosphere."}

It is a well-established theory that has been tested and confirmed through many studies.\nThe following is a correct statement about the cohesion-tension theory: Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure. This movement of water is driven by the difference in hydrostatic pressure, which is a result of the cohesion of water molecules and the tension generated within the water column.\nThe following statements are not correct:\nThe evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column.\nEmbolisms (air bubbles) in the water column are caused by the cohesion of water molecules.\nLiving cells of the xylem provide the main conduit for an ascent of water."}

{"question": "In plants, proton pumps are involved in the process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport. Which of the following is true about this process?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is passive."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It depends on DNA."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It requires ATP."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It translocates starch."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The phloem is a complex plant tissue that can transport sugars, amino acids, and other molecules across long distances. Plant cells use proton pumps to move protons from one side of a membrane to the other. This creates an imbalance in the number of protons on each side of the membrane, known as a proton gradient. The proton gradient can then be used to drive the transport of molecules across the membrane, using a process called active transport.\nWhen a substance is transported across a membrane, it can move against the direction of the proton gradient. This movement requires energy. So, the creation of a proton gradient is the first step in a process that can use it to transport substances across a membrane.\nSOLUTION: In plants, proton pumps are involved in the process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport. This process creates a proton gradient. The proton gradient can then be used to drive the transport of the sugars across the membrane. So, the process does not depend on DNA and does not require ATP."}
