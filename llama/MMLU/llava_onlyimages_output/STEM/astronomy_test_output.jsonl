One of the stars is a white dwarf, and the other is a larger star. The larger star is able to pull the hydrogen from the white dwarf. This causes the white dwarf to become unstable and explode in a supernova.\nType-Ia supernovae produce high amounts of X-rays. This is because a type-Ia supernova is so explosive. The explosion is so powerful that it sets off a shock wave that travels through space. This shock wave can produce X-rays.\nType-Ia supernovae do not produce gamma-ray bursts. A gamma-ray burst is a brief, intense release of gamma rays. Type-Ia supernovae are not intense enough to produce gamma-ray bursts.\nType-Ia supernovae can occur in any galaxy. A galaxy is a collection of stars and other matter. Some galaxies are rich in matter. So, it is easier for a type-Ia supernova to occur in a young galaxy.\nType-Ia supernovae do not produce high amounts of X-rays. This is because a type-Ia supernova is not explosive enough to produce high amounts of X-rays."}

{"question": "Why is the sky blue?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. When light travels through the atmosphere, the molecules in the atmosphere scatter, or reflect, the light. Scattering can cause the light to change direction.\nThe color of a substance is a result of the wavelengths of light that it reflects. Objects that look blue to the human eye reflect a short wavelength of light.\nSOLUTION: The atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\nWhen light with a short wavelength enters the atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions. So, the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\nThe sky is blue because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths."}

The higher the object's total energy, the more work the object can do.\nThe kinetic energy of an object is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure force, the greater the mass of the object and the higher the speed of the object, the higher their kinetic energy.\nSo, for a comet, the greater the comet's mass and the higher the speed of the comet at the time of impact, the more energy is released during the impact.\nSOLUTION: The minimum impact speed is the speed at which the comet can hit the Earth and still clear the Earth's surface. This speed is called the minimum impact speed because it is the speed at which the comet will have the highest kinetic energy.\nAt the minimum impact speed, the kinetic energy of the comet is given by the formula:\n0.5*m*v^2\nwhere m is the mass of the comet and v is the speed of the comet.\nSo, the total energy released in the impact is:\n0.5*m*v^2."}
{"question": "Some of Mars'water is frozen in the soil and the ice caps and some was lost due to solar wind stripping but much of the original water is thought to have been lost through another mechanism.

In fact, some of the asteroids that are made mostly of water are named for the water they contain: 5142 Flora, 6542 Asuka, and 1862 Apollo.\nSo, the water on these asteroids could have been a source for the water on Earth.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether Earth's oceans came from asteroids, you need to consider both the source of the water and the destination.\nThe source of the water on most asteroids is not local. Instead, the water on asteroids formed farther out in the solar system and was transported to the asteroids by comets.\nSo, the water on asteroids did not come from Earth.\nAs for the destination, Earth's oceans did not come from asteroids.\nThe oceans on Earth are thought to have formed on Earth.\nThe evidence for this comes from the isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's oceans. Isotopes are types of atoms that have the same number of protons (and thus the same atomic number) but a different number of neutrons.\nThe isotopes of hydrogen in Earth's oceans are different from the isotopes in water on other solar system bodies. This difference suggests that Earth's oceans were not formed by water that came from other solar system bodies.\nInstead, the oceans were formed by water that was already on Earth.\nThe water was either part of the original Earth or was added to the Earth as water was transported to the planet in comets."}

But motion alone does not create a magnetic field. Instead, the motion of molten iron in Earth's core generates an electric current, and it is the interaction of electric currents with magnetic fields that creates a magnetic field.\nSo, to have a strong magnetic field, a planet must have a liquid metal core and be rapidly rotating.\nThe other terrestrial planets have solid cores. Venus and Mars are the only other terrestrial worlds with partially molten metallic cores. But Venus is not rapidly rotating, and Mars is. So, Earth is the only terrestrial world with both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation."}

A resonance occurs when a planet's orbital period is a simple fraction of the orbital period of another planet. For example, Venus orbits the Sun in 1.6 years, which is a simple fraction of Earth's 1 year orbit. They are in a 1:1 resonance, because for every 1 year that Earth orbits the Sun, Venus orbits the Sun 1.6 years later.\nAnother example is the 3:2 resonance. Neptune orbits the Sun in 165 years, which is a simple fraction of Pluto's 248 year orbit. For every 3 orbits of Neptune, Pluto orbits the Sun 2 times.\nThe Kirkwood gaps are areas of decreased asteroid density in the main asteroid belt. These gaps are due to resonances with Jupiter. Jupiter's orbit is 11.86 years, which is a simple fraction of the 5:2 resonance. For every 5 times Jupiter orbits the Sun, the asteroids move around the Sun 2 times.

So, particles in a planet's rings must be nearer to the planet than any of the planet's large moons.\nSOLUTION: A large moon is, by definition, a moon that is larger than any of the other moons of its planet. So, for a planet to have large moons, it must be nearer to its planet than any of its large moons. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, nearer to their planet than any of the planet's large moons. is not a requirement for planetary rings.\nThe other three statements are requirements for planetary rings. So, the correct answer is B."}

They also discovered that some meteorites are made mainly of metals. So, scientists predict that some asteroids are the source of some meteorites.\nSOLUTION: Scientists can use the similarities between meteorites and asteroids to determine which asteroids are the sources of the meteorites.\nOne way to do this is to study the spectra of the two objects. A spectrum shows how the color and brightness of light change as it passes through an object.\nScientists have found that the spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt. But the spectra of meteorites are not identical to the spectra of any known asteroids.

An ellipse is a stretched-out circle. The Sun is at one focus of the ellipse.\nThe second law states that planets move faster when they are closer to the Sun.\nThe third law states that the force of attraction between the Sun and a planet is proportional to the distance between them. This means that the force of attraction is weaker when a planet is farther from the Sun.\nSOLUTION: As a planet moves around its orbit, it sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This law is known as the conservation of area. It does not directly follow from Kepler's laws.\nThe orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. This is Kepler's first law.\nThe force of attraction between any two objects decreases with the square of the distance between their centers. This is a definition of the inverse square law.

One of the leading hypotheses is that the Earth and Moon formed together in the same location, a hypothesis known as co-accretion. This hypothesis was first proposed in the 1970s and has been supported by a number of subsequent findings.\nSome of the evidence that supports the co-accretion hypothesis includes:\nthe Moon has a chemical composition that is almost identical to that of the Earth's crust.\nThe moons of other planets are more likely to form in orbit farther from their planet.\nThe Earth and Moon are the closest in size to each other of any planet-moon pair.\nSome of the evidence that has been interpreted as supporting the capture hypothesis includes:\nthe Moon's orbit is always oriented in the same direction as the Earth is orbiting the Sun, which could be the result of the Moon being captured into an orbit that was already aligned in that direction.\nThe Moon does not have the same composition as the Earth.\nThe leading hypothesis for the origin of the Moon is co-accretion, not capture.\nThe tidal forces hypothesis suggests that the Moon was once in a closer orbit to the Earth, but the Earth's spin was too slow. The Moon was then pushed into a higher orbit by the tidal forces raised by the Earth's ocean tides. Eventually, the Moon's orbit settled into its present location.\nThis hypothesis does not explain why the Moon is made of the same material as the Earth.\nThe idea that the Earth was rotating so rapidly that the Moon split from it is not a hypothesis that has been considered by scientists."}

Scientists can use the principle of superposition to determine the relative ages of layers of sediment. For example, in a sedimentary rock, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.\nAnother line of evidence is the cratering history of Earth\u2019s surface. The impact of a asteroid or comet on the surface of the Earth produces a crater. Counting the number of craters in an area can give an estimate of the time elapsed since the area was last affected by an impact.\nA third line of evidence is the radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites.

But what if the organisms had never turned into fossils? What if they never died in the first place? That's where the study of fossils of extinct organisms comes in.\nThe process of an organism turning into a fossil is called fossil formation. The way an organism turns into a fossil depends on the type of fossil formation.\nThere are several different types of fossils, including:\npermineralization: This type of fossil formation happens when an organism's body turns into a fossil while the organism is still alive. This type of fossil formation is very rare.\nburial: This type of fossil formation happens when an organism's body is buried. The body may be broken down by bacteria, but the fossil can still form.\nfossil formation by replacement: This type of fossil formation happens when a different organism's body replaces the body of an organism. This type of fossil formation often happens when an organism's body turns into a different type of rock.\nfossil formation by evaluation: This type of fossil formation happens when a fossil is formed from the remains of an organism's body that have been eroded out of a rock.\nSOLUTION: The first fossils formed from organisms that never turned into fossils were fossils formed by evaluation. This type of fossil formation happened when a fossil was formed from the remains of an organism's body that had been eroded out of a rock.\nFossils formed by evaluation are usually the remains of plants and animals that lived in ancient oceans. The remains of organisms that lived on land are usually destroyed by weathering and erosion. But organisms that lived in oceans could be preserved in rocks that formed far below the surface of the earth."}

When this happens, the moons and the planet are in resonance.\nThere are many resonances in our solar system. For example, Jupiter's moon Europa is in a 2:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. This means that for every two orbits Europa makes around Jupiter, Jupiter makes one orbit around the sun.\nThe diagram below shows how three of Jupiter's moons are in a 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3 resonance with Jupiter.\nThe moons and Jupiter are in resonance because the periods of their orbits are in a 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3 ratio, respectively.\nGaps in planetary rings and the 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3 resonances\nThe gap in Saturn's rings is caused by the 4:3 resonance. The same is true for the gaps in Jupiter's ring.\nHowever, the 2:3 periodic ratio of Neptune:Pluto is not caused by orbital resonance.\nThe Kirkwood gaps are small gaps in the asteroid belt. They are caused by the 1:1 and 2:1 resonances with Jupiter.\nThe breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials is not caused by orbital resonance.\nSOLUTION: A 2:3 periodic ratio means that Neptune and Pluto complete 2 and 3 orbits, respectively, while making one orbit around the sun. They are not in orbital resonance.\nThe Kirkwood gaps are caused by the 1:1 and 2:1 resonances with Jupiter. These resonances affect the orbits of the asteroids, but not their periods.\nGaps in Saturn's rings are caused by the 4:3 resonance.

The presence of a strong magnetic field can enhance a planet's greenhouse effect.\nThe solar wind is a stream of charged particles that is constantly released by the sun. When the solar wind reaches a planet, it can affect that planet's magnetic field and atmosphere.\nThe solar wind can strip away a planet's atmosphere, which can cool the planet down. This is what is thought to have happened to Mars. Without a strong magnetic field to protect the atmosphere, the solar wind was able to strip away most of Mars' atmosphere. This significantly reduced the greenhouse effect on Mars, cooling the planet down."}

This ratio is called the greenhouse effectiveness. On Mars, the atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, but there is not enough of it to create a strong greenhouse effect.\nThe greenhouse effect actually helps to keep Mars warm. Without a greenhouse effect, the temperature on Mars would be about 195 K (-88oC). With a greenhouse effect, the temperature on Mars is about 218 K (-55oC). So, Mars would be 35oC colder without a greenhouse effect.\nMars does not have enough internal heat to drive the greenhouse effect. Internal heat is created by the decays of radioactive elements. Mars has some radioactive elements, but not enough to create a lot of internal heat.\nThe greenhouse effect requires an ozone layer which Mars does not have.

These planets are thought to form as gas giants beyond the frost line and then migrate inwards.\nThe frost line is the distance from a star beyond which the temperature is low enough that volatile compounds such as water, methane, and ammonia will condense into solid layers. These layers can build up until they reach a thickness where the pressure is high enough to start a runaway gas giant.\nThe solid layers that build up beyond the frost line can trap gas giants that form farther out. If the star has fewer than about four times the mass of the Sun, the gas giants can migrate inward to close orbits. If the star has more than about four times the mass of the Sun, the gas giants can migrate outward."}

This happens because some types of molecules in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, can absorb the heat from the sun.\nMars has an atmosphere that is almost entirely carbon dioxide. But, the atmosphere on Mars is too thin to trap a significant amount of heat. Thin air does not create a strong greenhouse effect."}

Communicate your results.\nYou can use the scientific method to answer a question and find out if a theory is true.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she sets up a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, the engineer makes an observation. She notes that the prototype bridge moves less in high winds compared to an unprototyped bridge.\nThen, the engineer forms an initial hypothesis. She hypothesizes that a bridge designed with certain materials and shapes will move less in high winds.\nThe engineer then tests her hypothesis. She builds a full-scale bridge using the materials and shapes she thinks will move less in high winds. Then, she exposes the new bridge to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nAfter testing, the engineer analyzes her data. The data shows that the prototype bridge moved less than the unprototyped bridge in high winds. So, the engineer concludes that her hypothesis is correct.\nThe engineer can communicate her results to others. They can use her results to build bridges that move less in high winds."}

{"question": "How do astronomers think Jupiter generates its internal heat?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "nuclear fusion in the core"}, {"label": "B", "text": "by contracting changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "internal friction due to its high rotation rate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "chemical processes"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Jupiter is by far the largest planet in our solar system. It is so large that it has its own gravity well. Objects in Jupiter's gravity well experience a stronger gravitational pull than objects in our Sun's gravity well. So, Jupiter is a cold planet.\nJupiter does not generate its own heat. It gets its heat from the Sun. The Sun's gravity keeps Jupiter from flying away. Instead, Jupiter orbits the Sun. As Jupiter orbits, it gets closer to the Sun. When Jupiter gets closer to the Sun, it gets more heat from the Sun.\nJupiter does not have a core. Jupiter is made of gas. The gas in Jupiter's atmosphere is very deep. So, nuclear fusion in the core of Jupiter is not possible.\nBy contracting changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy is a process that happens in all objects. This process generates thermal energy, or heat. So, Jupiter generates its internal heat by contracting changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy.\nInternal friction due to its high rotation rate is a type of heat generation. But Jupiter is not a solid. So, Jupiter does not generate its internal heat through internal friction due to its high rotation rate.\nChemical processes can generate heat. But chemical processes in Jupiter's core are not thought to generate enough heat to account for the heat that Jupiter has."}

For example, sediments might be deposited in layers like the layers of a cake, or they might be deposited in layers that formed as the planet's surface was folded and bent. Over time, these layers can be pressed together to form a rock.\nThe study of sedimentary layers is called stratigraphy. Stratigraphy can tell you the order of layers on the surface of a planet.\nThe relative ages of layers are determined by their order. The deeper layers are usually older than the shallower layers.\nThe absolute ages of layers are determined by using radiometric dating. Radiometric dating uses the decay of radioactive substances to calculate the age of a rock.\nSOLUTION: Venus is a planet with a thick crust and a long history.

{"question": "Why do jovian planets bulge around the equator that is have a \"squashed\" appearance?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Their large systems of moons and rings gravitationally attract the mass around the equator more."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are much more massive than the terrestrial planets."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their internal heat sources exert a pressure against the sides of the planets."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The bulging of a jovian planet is called a flattening. The flattening of Jupiter is about 1/7. This means that Jupiter is a little over 1/7th larger in diameter at the equator than from pole to pole.\nJupiter's flattening is caused by the planet's rapid rotation. As Jupiter rotates, the mass near the equator is pulled outward by Jupiter's rotational motion. This effect is called the Coriolis effect.\nThe Coriolis effect is stronger near the equator because the rotational motion of Jupiter is faster there. So, the mass near the equator is flung outward more than the mass at higher latitudes. This causes the equator to bulge out."}

So, Jupiter does not generate heat through exothermic chemical reactions or internal friction due to its rotation.\nJupiter is a massive planet, and it has a very powerful gravitational pull. So, Jupiter can generate thermal energy by contracting, or getting smaller. This process changes Jupiter's gravitational potential energy into thermal energy.\nNuclear fusion is a process in which atoms are fused together to form a heavier atom. This process releases a large amount of energy as thermal energy. So, Jupiter could generate thermal energy through nuclear fusion."}

Liquid water is essential to life as we know it. So, the habitable zone is defined as the region where the temperatures on the surface of planets are within the range of 0 to 100\u00b0C.\nLife, as we know it, needs water. But the water must be in a liquid form. If the temperature is below 0\u00b0C, water is a solid. If the temperature is above 100\u00b0C, water is a gas.

This is because Cepheid variables have a relationship between their brightness and their period of oscillation. This relationship was discovered in 1908 by the American astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt.\nLeCTURE: Astronomers use the relationship between a Cepheid's brightness and its period to determine the star's distance. This is done by comparing the star's brightness to the brightness-period relationship for Cepheid variables.\nCepheid variables are useful for measuring distances because they are bright and can be easily observed. In addition, they are relatively rare, which makes them useful for identifying other galaxies.\nSOLUTION: To measure galactic distances, astronomers use Cepheid variables. The period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables is used to determine the distance to a galaxy.\nTo measure interstellar mass, astronomers use other types of stars. The mass of interstellar gas and dust can be determined from observations of star formation.\nTo measure galactic energy-density, astronomers use other types of stars. Energy-density is a measure of the energy available in a system per unit volume. This type of measurement can be done with stars that are not Cepheid variables.\nTo measure interstellar density, astronomers use other types of stars. Density is a measure of the mass of a substance per volume. This type of measurement can be done with any type of star."}
