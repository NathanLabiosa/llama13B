This policy shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. The shift in the aggregate demand curve leads to an increase in real output and a decrease in the price level, which is a response to the decrease in inflation.\nSo, from the fact that an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level, it can be inferred that aggregate supply decreased."}

These events can put upward pressure on prices and lead to a rise in the price level. At the same time, in the short run, aggregate demand is affected by events that are not expected to continue or affect long-run aggregate supply. These events can put downward pressure on prices and lead to a fall in the price level.\nSo, in the short run, both the price level and real GDP can rise. This happens because the pressure on prices from increases in aggregate supply is offset by the pressure on prices from increases in aggregate demand. At the same time, real GDP rises because the increase in aggregate demand leads to an increase in output.\nSOLUTION: When both short-run aggregate supply and aggregate demand increase, the price level rises but real GDP falls. This outcome can be ruled out.\nWhen both short-run aggregate supply and aggregate demand increase, the price level rises but the change in real GDP is uncertain. This outcome is possible.\nBoth the price level and real GDP rise. This outcome is consistent with the fact that in the short run, increases in aggregate supply and aggregate demand can lead to higher prices and higher output.\nReal GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain.

The purpose of a tariff is to make imported products more expensive. This can protect domestic businesses from foreign competition.\nA quota is a limit on the amount of a product that can be imported. A quota can also include a tariff to make sure that the imported product does not exceed the limit.\nSOLUTION: A tariff raises the price of the imported product. So, a tariff results in lower domestic prices.\nA quota can sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically. This depends on whether the quota is set above or below the quantity of the product that consumers want to buy.\nIf the quota is set above the quantity of the product that consumers want to buy, the domestic price will be lower than it would be without the quota. So, a quota can sometimes raise the amount of the product sold domestically.\nIf the quota is set below the quantity of the product that consumers want to buy, the domestic price will be higher than it would be without the quota. So, a quota can sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically."}

To finance a budget deficit, governments often sell bonds to investors. The money from the bond sales is used to finance the deficit, and the investors become bondholders.\nBond prices can be affected by changes in a country's fiscal policy. Fiscal policy refers to the ways in which a government takes money from people or businesses and spends it. An increase in the budget deficit as a result of expanded government spending or a tax cut could lead to a decrease in bond prices. This is because the increase in the budget deficit would increase the amount of bonds that the government needs to sell to finance the deficit. This increase in supply would drive down the price of the bonds.\nSOLUTION: A budget deficit could lead to a decrease in bond prices. This is because the government would need to sell more bonds to finance the deficit."}

Studying for the exam is the best alternative for you in this case. But by choosing to study, you give up the opportunity to go to the party. The opportunity cost of your choice is the value of the foregone best alternative.\nIn order to decide whether a choice is worthwhile, you need to compare the benefit of the choice to its opportunity cost.\nIf the benefit of a choice is greater than its opportunity cost, the choice is worthwhile.\nIf the benefit is less than the opportunity cost, the choice is not worthwhile.\nYou need to calculate the opportunity cost to do this comparison.\nThe opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the foregone best alternative. This value is different for each choice.\nFor example, the opportunity cost of going to a party on a weeknight is the value of the foregone best alternative for that night. The opportunity cost of going to a party on a weekend is the value of the foregone best alternative for that weekend.\nOne type of cost is an accounting cost. This type of cost is easy to calculate.\nAn accounting cost is a cost that is included in financial statements. For example, the cost of materials is an accounting cost.\nAnother type of cost is a switching cost. This type of cost is not easy to calculate.\nA switching cost is a cost that arises when you change from one product or service to another. For example, the cost of training employees on a new computer system is a switching cost.\nA third type of cost is an inferior cost. This type of cost is also not easy to calculate.\nAn inferior cost is a cost incurred when you choose a product or service that is worse than the best alternative. For example, the cost of buying a car that is less safe than the best car on the market is an inferior cost.\nThe final type of cost is a sunk cost. This type of cost is not easy to calculate and does not matter for today's decision.\nA sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred in the past. The name \"sunk cost\" highlights the fact that this type of cost is \"sunk\" or gone. SOLUTION: An opportunity cost is a cost that is incurred when you choose one alternative over another.\nTo figure out which choice is worthwhile, compare the benefit of the choice to its opportunity cost.\nThe benefit of a choice is the value of the goods and services you get from the choice.\nFor example, if you buy a car, the benefit of your choice is the value that you get from driving the car. This value might include the convenience of having a car, the ability to drive to work, and the pleasure of driving a particular make and model.\nThe opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the foregone best alternative. This value is different for each choice.\nFor example, the opportunity cost of buying a car is the value of the foregone best alternative for that day. The opportunity cost of buying a more expensive car is the value of the foregone best alternative for that day.\nThe accounting cost of a choice is a cost that is included in financial statements.\nFor example, the cost of materials is an accounting cost.\nThe switching cost of a choice is a cost that arises when you change from one product or service to another.\nFor example, the cost of training employees on a new computer system is a switching cost.\nThe inferior cost of a choice is a cost incurred when you choose a product or service that is worse than the best alternative.\nFor example, the cost of buying a car that is less safe than the best car on the market is an inferior cost."}

This could lead to a higher level of economic activity.\nIn the closed economy, the expansionary monetary policy may lead to inflation, as the increase in the money supply leads to an increase in demand for goods and services. This increase in demand can lead to higher prices and inflation.\nSo, ceteris paribus, an expansionary monetary policy is more effective in an open economy with flexible exchange rates than in a closed economy."}

This increase in spending can increase the demand for labor.\nSo, in the short run, a decrease in household taxes can decrease unemployment.\nHowever, in the long run, the effect of a decrease in household taxes on unemployment is likely to be small. This is because the decrease in household taxes is not likely to affect the overall demand for goods and services.\nBut, in either the short run or the long run, a decrease in household taxes can increase inflation.\nSOLUTION: In the short run, a decrease in household taxes can increase demand for goods and services. This increase in demand can increase the demand for labor, leading to a decrease in unemployment.\nHowever, the increase in demand for labor is likely to cause a rise in wages. Since the cost of labor is a component of the cost of goods and services, the increase in wages can lead to an increase in inflation.\nSo, in the short run, a decrease in household taxes is likely to cause unemployment to fall with little inflation."}

They are already in place and will change on their own according to the state of the economy.\nTwo types of automatic stabilizers are:\n1. Progressive income tax: When the economy is in a recession, the government collects less in taxes. This happens because people's incomes decrease, and some people may have trouble paying their taxes. In addition, unemployment insurance and other transfer payments increase, reducing the tax revenue.\n2. Social Security and unemployment insurance: When the economy is in a recession, more people file for unemployment insurance. This increases the demand for government spending.\nRecessions can be caused by any factor that reduces the demand for goods and services. This can include a decrease in business investment, a decrease in consumer spending, or an increase in taxes.\nWhen the economy is in a recession, the government can use fiscal policy to help stabilize the economy. For example, the government can decrease taxes to increase the after-tax income of consumers and businesses. This can help increase the demand for goods and services, which can help the economy grow."}

This increases the demand for the good.\nIf producers expect the price of a good to be higher in the near future, they are likely to increase their production of the good today. This increases the supply of the good.\nBoth higher demand and higher supply increase the equilibrium quantity.\nAt the new equilibrium, the price is higher, and the quantity is higher.\nIf consumers expect the price of a good to be lower in the near future, they are likely to buy less of the good today. This decreases the demand for the good.\nIf producers expect the price of a good to be lower in the near future, they are likely to decrease their production of the good today. This decreases the supply of the good.\nBoth lower demand and lower supply decrease the equilibrium quantity.\nAt the new equilibrium, the price is lower, and the quantity is lower.\nSOLUTION: Lower prices for seed corn and fertilizer decrease the cost of producing a bushel of corn. This means that the equilibrium quantity of corn is likely to rise.\nAt the same time, lower expected prices for corn in the future mean that the market price of corn is expected to fall. This means that the equilibrium price of corn is likely to fall.\nHowever, the equilibrium price is indeterminate. An indeterminate equation is one in which the value of the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity are both zero. In an indeterminate equation, you cannot determine whether the equilibrium price will rise or fall."}

When a bank makes a loan, it creates new money. The bank can use this new money to make other loans, which can then be used to make even more loans.\nThe deposit money in a bank is called a reservoir of money. When a bank makes a loan, it taps into this reservoir. The loan becomes a new source of money.\nThe reserves of a bank are the funds it has on hand to meet withdrawals and other needs. Reserves are held in a special account at the central bank.\nA bank's reserve requirement is a percentage of its deposits that the bank must hold in reserve. The reserve requirement is set by the central bank.\nSOLUTION: When a bank receives a deposit of $1,000, it can use that deposit to make a loan of $8,000. This is called the multiplication effect. The $8,000 loan becomes a new source of money.\nThe $8,000 loan can be used to make another loan of $8,000. This new loan can then be used to make another loan of $8,000. And so on.\nThe result of these transactions is that $80,000 of money is created in new loans from all banks. This is called the accumulation effect."}

These increases come from technological progress and from an increase in the effective number of people in the population.\nAn important part of economic growth is the willingness to take risk and to save. When individuals save, they make it possible for capital to be invested in new goods and services. This increased capital can be used to create new products and new industries, which can increase the effective number of people in the population.\nSOLUTION: Improving education is a way to increase the effective number of people in the population. By making people more productive, education can increase economic growth. But improving education is a long-term policy. It does not by itself create immediate economic growth.\nIncreasing government spending can create an immediate increase in economic growth. This increase comes from the creation of new government jobs and from the increase in wages and salaries for government workers.\nBut increased government spending can also create a problem. Governments can only increase their spending by borrowing money or by raising taxes. If they borrow too much money, they can create a debt crisis. If they raise taxes too much, they can slow economic growth by reducing the incentive to work, save, and invest.\nPromoting improvements in the education of the population is a long-term policy that can increase economic growth. But it does not create an immediate increase in economic growth.\nPlacing taxes on savings can reduce the incentive to save. This reduction in the incentive to save can slow economic growth.\nImposing tariffs to protect domestic industries from foreign competition can create an immediate increase in economic growth. This increase comes from the increase in wages and salaries for workers in the protected industries.\nBut tariffs can also create a problem. Tariffs can increase the cost of goods and services for consumers. This increase can reduce the amount of goods and services that consumers buy."}

When the government borrows money, it increases the demand for loanable funds. This increase in demand leads to an increase in interest rates.\nHigher interest rates make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money. As a result, businesses may decide to delay or reduce their investments. For example, a business may decide to delay building a new factory because the high interest rates make borrowing too expensive.\nSOLUTION: When the government borrows to conduct contractionary fiscal policy, it increases the demand for loanable funds.

The terms are staggered, so that each year, the terms of some Governors expire and the terms of others begin.\nThe table shows the terms of the Governors. It shows the year in which each Governor's term begins and the year in which it expires.\nSo, for the first 7 years, there are 5 Governors whose terms begin in the first 7 years. For the next 7 years, there are 5 Governors whose terms begin in the next 7 years.

The central bank's balance sheet is determined by the size of its asset holdings and the amount of money it has in circulation.\nThe size of the central bank's asset holdings is determined by its reserve requirements and the amount of money it has in circulation. As a result, the size of the central bank's balance sheet is determined by the size of its asset holdings and the amount of money it has in circulation.\nThe discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the central bank. Lowering the discount rate does not affect the size of the central bank's balance sheet, so it does not lead to a decrease in the money supply.\nSelling government securities in the secondary market does not affect the size of the central bank's balance sheet, so it does not lead to a decrease in the money supply.\nSpending less money by the federal government decreases the money supply. When the government spends less money, it needs to issue fewer bonds to finance its spending. The proceeds from the sale of bonds are reduced, which means that the size of the central bank's asset holdings is reduced. This leads to a decrease in the money supply.\nLowering reserve requirements allows banks to hold less money in reserve and more money in loans. This increases the money supply."}

It is a situation in which the economy is growing at a slow rate and the rate of inflation is high.\nOne of the main causes of stagflation is a decrease in the supply of oil. Oil is a key input in the production of many goods and services. So, when the supply of oil decreases, the cost of producing goods and services increases. This can lead to higher prices for goods and services, which is inflation.\nAt the same time, stagflation can cause the economy to grow more slowly. When prices are high, people have less money to spend. So, businesses sell fewer goods and services. This can lead to lower output and employment.\nSOLUTION: One of the main causes of stagflation is a decrease in the supply of oil. So, the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right.\nThe aggregate supply curve shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of output. When the price level is higher, the quantity of output that firms are willing to sell at those prices is lower. So, the shift to the right in the aggregate supply curve shows that firms are willing to sell less output at each price level."}

As a result, the unemployment rate is understated, or lower than it would be if discouraged workers were included. This can make the economy look stronger than it is because it appears that there is less unemployment than there actually is."}

This means that assets in M2 can be easily exchanged for cash, while assets in MI cannot. So, some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in MI.\nM2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash and assets that can quickly be converted into cash. These assets include checking deposits, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, and savings deposits. MI is a measure of the money supply that includes assets that are not as liquid as those included in M2. These assets include time deposits and non-negotiable certificates of deposit.\nThe value of gold is fixed at $42.22 per ounce, and the United States promises to exchange gold for currency.

When stagflation occurs, the economy is growing at a slow rate, and prices are rising quickly. Stagflation is rare, but it has happened in the past, such as during the 1970s.\nThere are several possible causes of stagflation. One possible cause is a decrease in the effectiveness of central banking. A central bank is responsible for managing a country's money supply and interest rates. But as economic conditions change, a central bank's policies may become less effective. For example, if interest rates are already low, a central bank may have difficulty reducing them further to stimulate the economy.\nAnother possible cause of stagflation is a decrease in the marginal propensity to import. The marginal propensity to import is a measure of the proportion of an increase in income that is spent on imports. If the marginal propensity to import decreases, then an increase in income will lead to a smaller increase in imports. This could reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy, which is based on the idea that increasing the money supply can stimulate the economy by increasing exports.\nSOLUTION: A decrease in both AD and SRAS is the most effective way to cause stagflation. A decrease in AD with a constant SRAS would not cause stagflation. An increase in AD with a constant SRAS would not cause stagflation. A decrease in SRAS with a constant AD would not cause stagflation."}

This decrease in the value of money affects people in different ways, depending on how they earn or spend money.\nSome people have fixed incomes. They get a paycheck that does not go up with the price level. For these people, a rising price level means that each dollar has less buying power than before.\nOther people are debtors. They owe money to a lender, and the lender requires a fixed amount of money each month. For these people, a rising price level means that each dollar has less buying power than before. This can make it difficult for debtors to pay off their debts.\nInvestors may be affected by inflation too. When inflation rises, it may rise more quickly than income from investments. As a result, the value of investments may decrease.\nProperty owners may also be affected by a rising price level. If the price level rises faster than rents, the value of real estate may decrease.\nSOLUTION: People with fixed money incomes will suffer the most from a rising price level. A rise in the price level means that each dollar has less buying power than before. For people with fixed money incomes, this means that their income is now worth less than it was before."}

The actions of the Federal Reserve affect the money supply.\nThe Federal Reserve can change the money supply through its control of the reserve requirement and the discount rate.\nThe reserve requirement is the percentage of deposits that banks must hold in their reserve accounts. A higher reserve requirement means that banks have to keep more money in their accounts. This reduces the amount of money that banks can lend, which reduces the money supply.\nThe discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money. A lower discount rate means that it is cheaper for banks to borrow money. This can increase the money supply as banks can now make more loans.\nSelling bonds and buying bonds are ways that the Federal Reserve can affect the money supply. Selling bonds does not affect the reserve requirement or the discount rate. As a result, selling bonds will not increase the money supply. Buying bonds increases the money supply. When the Federal Reserve buys bonds, it pays with money it has created. This increase the money supply."}

This relationship is known as the quantity demanded curve.\nThe quantity demanded curve is downward-sloping, which means that if the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded of the product will decrease. Conversely, if the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded of the product will increase.\nSOLUTION: If people expect the price of a particular product to increase in the near future, they will want to buy the product before the price increases. This will decrease the quantity demanded today.\nHowever, the quantity demanded today is not affected by expectations of future price increases.\nThe quantity demanded now or later is affected by expectations of future price increases.

This means that if the price level does not change when there is an increase in aggregate demand, then the spending multiplier will be less than 1.\nThe spending multiplier is a measure of how much an increase in spending by one category of actors in an economy is multiplied by the spending of another category of actors. For example, an increase in spending by consumers would be multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume, which is less than 1. So, an increase in spending by consumers would lead to a decrease in the price level, other things equal.\nIf the price level is constant with an increase in aggregate demand, then the spending multiplier is less than 1. This means that an increase in aggregate demand will not lead to a proportional increase in the price level. Instead, the increase in aggregate demand will be less than the proportional increase in the price level."}

When aggregate demand increases, so does the price level.\nReal GDP is affected by changes in both price level and output per unit. Because an increase in aggregate demand in the intermediate range of the aggregate supply curve will only increase price level and not change real GDP, real GDP will not change."}

This value is affected by the cost of living, the savings rate, the price level, and economic growth.\nThe cost of living is a measure of the average price level of a basket of goods and services in an economy. A high cost of living indicates that goods and services are expensive relative to average incomes. If the domestic purchasing power of a currency varies directly with the cost of living, the currency will be able to buy the same amount of goods and services over time.\nThe savings rate is a measure of the percentage of income that households save. A high savings rate indicates that households are saving more of their income. This can reduce the demand for goods and services and, in turn, lower the price level. If the domestic purchasing power of a currency is inversely related to the savings rate, the currency will be able to buy more goods and services when the savings rate is low.\nThe price level is a measure of the average price level of a basket of goods and services in an economy.

This can increase the domestic purchasing power of a currency, making it possible to buy more goods and services. If the domestic purchasing power of a currency varies directly with economic growth, the currency will be able to buy more goods and services in the future.\nSOLUTION: The domestic purchasing power of a currency is affected by the cost of living, the savings rate, the price level, and economic growth.\nThe first step is to determine which variables affect the domestic purchasing power of a currency. The domestic purchasing power of a currency varies directly with the cost of living and inversely with the price level. It is inversely related to the savings rate and to economic growth.\nSo, the domestic purchasing power of a currency is inversely related to the price level. This means that when the price level is high, the domestic purchasing power of the currency is low. When the price level is low, the domestic purchasing power of the currency is high."}

Instead, the price level will remain unchanged until prices can adjust. In this case, a decrease in aggregate demand will result in a lower price level.\nA change in the price level affects the real value of each good and service in the economy. Further increases in aggregate demand will not directly affect the unemployment rate, but they will create inflation.\nThe short-run aggregate supply curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the price level and the quantity of output that firms are willing to supply in the short run. When the price level is constant, the short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal.\nFurther increases in aggregate demand will not directly affect the unemployment rate, but they will create inflation. This is because the short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal. An increase in aggregate demand will not cause firms to produce more goods and services.

For example, if a country exports $50 billion worth of goods and imports $60 billion worth of goods, its net exports are -$10 billion.\nGDP is a measure of the value of all the goods and services produced within a nation's borders. For example, if a country's GDP is $200 billion, that means its residents produced $200 billion worth of goods and services over a certain period of time.\nSOLUTION: An American buying an entertainment system that was manufactured in China means that the American is purchasing a good that was produced in another country. Because the transaction was between an American and a foreign company, the transaction will affect the United States' net exports.\nThe transaction will also affect the United States' GDP. When a country imports goods, it is spending money on goods that were produced elsewhere. This means that the country's GDP is affected by the transactions that take place outside of its borders. In the United States, GDP is affected by transactions that take place both inside and outside of the United States.\nThe increase in the United States' net exports will tend to increase the country's GDP.

To encourage foreign lenders to continue lending, the nation may need to offer higher interest on its debt. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for the government and for consumers and businesses in the nation. As the cost of borrowing increases, investors may decide to invest in other nations with lower interest rates.\nA depreciation of a nation's currency lowers the value of the nation's currency relative to other currencies. This makes the nation's exports more affordable to foreign consumers and their imports more expensive. As a result, the nation's net exports may increase, or rise.\nLower interest rates could help boost economic growth and discourage foreign investors from investing in the nation's currency. But the effect of lower interest rates on a nation's currency is complex and could be to depreciate rather than appreciate the nation's currency.\nAn appreciation of a nation's currency would make its exports more expensive for foreign consumers. This could lead to a decline in the nation's net exports. An appreciation of a nation's currency is opposite to a depreciation."}

An easy money policy by the Fed can lead to lower interest rates.\nLower interest rates can encourage consumers to borrow money and spend more. This increase in spending can lead to an increase in gross domestic product (GDP).\nHowever, the increase in spending may not all go to increasing the exports of goods and services. So, an increase in net exports is less likely.\nAn increase in the real interest rate would be the opposite of an easy money policy. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation. So, an increase in the real interest rate would be an increase in the nominal interest rate.\nSOLUTION: To increase the demand for goods and services, the Fed can lower interest rates. But lower interest rates can also increase the demand for borrowing and investment. This can lead to an increase in the nominal interest rate.\nSo, an increase in the nominal interest rate could result from a use of easy money policy by the Fed."}

A higher velocity of money indicates that people are spending money more quickly. The formula for the velocity of money is:\nvelocity of money = transactions / money supply\nSOLUTION: When the inflation rate is expected to increase, people will begin saving more money. Because they are saving more money, they are not spending it as quickly. This means that the velocity of money will fall.\nA higher inflation rate puts upward pressure on the nominal interest rate. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate that is stated in terms of current dollars. It is possible that the real interest rate will increase as well. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for the expected rate of inflation.\nIf the inflation rate is expected to increase, investors will require a higher nominal interest rate to compensate for the erosion of the purchasing power of their money. This puts upward pressure on the nominal interest rate.\nA lower inflation rate puts downward pressure on the real interest rate. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for the expected rate of inflation. If the inflation rate is lower than expected, investors will be willing to accept a lower real interest rate. This puts downward pressure on the real interest rate."}

When the government borrows money, it increases the demand for bonds. This increased demand puts upward pressure on bond prices and downward pressure on interest rates.\nHowever, the crowding-out effect occurs because the increased demand for bonds reduces the money available for private investment. This reduction in money available for private investment leads to an increase in interest rates.\nThe effect of the President increasing the money supply is not the crowding-out effect. The text describes the crowding-out effect as the effect of government borrowing on interest rates. Increasing the money supply does not directly affect interest rates.\nThe effect of hearing the chairperson of the central bank say that he or she belles in a recession is not the crowding-out effect. The crowding-out effect describes the effect of government borrowing on interest rates. Hearing that the chairperson of the central bank believes that the economy is in a recession could increase interest rates, but it is not the crowding-out effect.\nThe leftward shift in AD in response to the rising interest rates from expansionary fiscal policy is the crowding-out effect. When interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases. This increase in the cost of borrowing reduces the money available for private investment. This reduction in money available for private investment leads to a decrease in aggregate demand, which is a leftward shift in AD.\nThe rightward shift in AD in response to the decreasing interest rates from contractionary fiscal policy is not the crowding-out effect.

This increase in the supply of bonds will tend to decrease the price of bonds. The decrease in the price of bonds will increase the yield (the return on bonds).\nThe higher yield will make investment in bonds less attractive compared to investment in other assets, such as stocks or real estate.

This policy can stimulate the economy in the short run. But in the long run, it may increase inflation and interest rates.\nDecreasing the value of the domestic currency would make exports cheaper and increase demand for goods and services. This could help offset the effects of an expansionary fiscal policy. However, it could also make imports more expensive, which could reduce demand.\nLowering the income tax rate would increase the after-tax income of individuals and businesses. This could stimulate spending and increase demand. But it would also decrease government revenue, which could reduce the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy.\nSelling Treasury securities to commercial banks would increase the supply of money and potentially lower interest rates. This could stimulate spending and increase demand. But it would also reduce the government's ability to borrow and could decrease the value of the domestic currency.\nLowering the discount rate would make borrowing cheaper and could stimulate spending.

{"question": "Use the following three responses to answer the question: Fiscal policy is not always effective because of I. crowding out. II. rational expectations.

This reduces private investment, which can offset the stimulative effects of fiscal policy.\nRational expectations is the idea that people will adjust their expectations based on their observations of the government's behavior. If people expect that a fiscal stimulus will be followed by higher taxes in the future to pay for the stimulus, they may not increase their spending as much as the government had hoped. This can make fiscal policy less effective.\nThe balanced budget amendment is a proposal to restrict the government from running deficits. This could reduce the effectiveness of fiscal policy, because it would limit the government's ability to use deficit spending to respond to recessions."}

{"question": "Which of the following is a consequence of a protective tariff on imported steel?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Net exports fall."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Income is transferred from domestic steel consumers to domestic steel producers."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Allocative efficiency is improved."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Income is transferred from domestic steel to foreign steel producers."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A protective tariff is a tax on imported goods. In this case, the tariff is on imported steel. A tariff can have several consequences.\nOne consequence of a protective tariff on imported steel is that it raises the price of steel. This means that domestic steel consumers have to pay more for steel.\nAnother consequence of a protective tariff on imported steel is that it lowers the price of steel. This means that domestic steel producers can sell their steel for more.\nA tariff can also affect the overall economy. One way a tariff can affect the overall economy is by changing the amount of goods that are traded. A tariff can make imported goods more expensive, which can decrease the quantity of imported goods sold. This can decrease the total amount of goods traded.\nA tariff can also change the mix of goods traded. A tariff can make imported goods more expensive, which can increase the quantity of domestic goods sold. This can change the mix of goods traded, so that more domestic goods are traded.\nA tariff can also affect the distribution of income. One way a tariff can affect the distribution of income is by transferring income from one group to another. For example, a tariff can transfer income from domestic steel consumers to domestic steel producers.\nA tariff can also affect allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency is a situation in which resources are allocated in the most efficient way. A tariff can affect allocative efficiency by changing the relative prices of goods. This can change the quantities of goods produced and consumed, which can affect allocative efficiency.\nSOLUTION: An allocative efficiency is not the same as transferring income from one group to another. So, a tariff can improve allocative efficiency without transferring income from one group to another.\nThe other three choices describe how a tariff can transfer income from one group to another. So, those choices describe consequences of a tariff."}

{"question": "Which of the following will promote economic growth?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "An increase in the amount of capital."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lower wages."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Price controls that keep prices low."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increased government spending."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: There are several ways in which the government can promote economic growth. One way is by increasing the amount of capital available in an economy. Capital includes all the tools and equipment that are used in the production of goods and services. When the government increases the amount of capital in an economy, it increases the resources available to firms. This can help firms grow and hire more workers.\nAnother way the government can promote economic growth is by increasing its own spending. When the government spends money, it can create jobs in the short run. For example, the government might hire workers to build a road or to teach in a public school. As a result, those workers will have income, and they will spend some of that income on goods and services. This can create jobs in other parts of the economy.\nLower wages might seem like a good way to increase the competitiveness of a country's exports. But in the long run, lower wages make it difficult for firms to attract and retain skilled workers. This can lead to a decrease in the quality of the workforce, which can decrease economic growth.\nPrice controls are a way in which the government can attempt to keep prices low. But price controls can have unintended consequences. For example, price controls can lead to a shortage of goods. This happens because fixed prices do not always reflect the supply and demand for goods. In the absence of price signals, firms have no incentive to increase production. So, firms may produce fewer goods than consumers want to buy. At the same time, consumers may want to buy more goods than firms are producing. This can lead to a shortage of goods.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the amount of capital and increased government spending can increase economic growth. These choices expand the amount of resources available to firms and create jobs.\nLower wages and price controls that keep prices low can decrease economic growth. These choices can decrease the incentives for firms to produce more goods and hire more workers."}

It is not a law in the same sense that, for example, Newton's laws of motion are laws in physics. Say's Law is named after French economist Jean-Baptiste Say.\nSay's Law states that production creates its own demand. This means that as long as resources are being used to produce goods and services, people will be employed and will have money to spend. This spending will create demand, and demand will in turn create more production. In this way, Say's Law suggests that economies can grow over time.\nThere are many criticisms of Say's Law. One major problem is that it assumes that all goods and services are sold at their equilibrium price. An equilibrium price is a price at which the quantity supplied of a good or service is equal to the quantity demanded.\nSay's Law is the basis of Classical economic analysis. In the Classical view, recessions and depressions occur when prices are not equal to their equilibrium prices. To return to equilibrium, prices need to fall. This will increase the quantity demanded of goods and services, which will increase production and employment.\nKeynes, however, argued that Say's Law is false. He believed that prices can be stuck above their equilibrium prices. In this case, the economy can be in a recession or depression.

These individuals want to save some of their income to spend in the future. Because they want to save their income, they reduce their spending, which increases the supply of loanable funds.\nInvestors are individuals who provide funds to businesses and government. Investors purchase stocks and bonds. When investors buy stocks and bonds, they increase the demand for loanable funds.\nThe stock market is a place where publicly traded companies can raise funds by selling stocks. When a company sells a stock in the stock market, it increases the demand for loanable funds.\nNet exports are the value of a country's exports minus the value of its imports. A country with a positive net export has more money coming in from exports than it has going out for imports. An increase in a country's net export increases the supply of loanable funds in that country."}

The multiplier effect is a measure of the change in real output that is caused by a change in government spending.\nThe multiplier effect is determined by two components: the marginal propensity to consume and the velocity of money.\nThe marginal propensity to consume is a measure of the proportion of an additional dollar of income that is spent. It is calculated as follows:\nMarginal propensity to consume = change in consumption / change in income\nThe velocity of money is a measure of the proportion of time that a dollar spends in circulation. It is calculated as follows:\nVelocity of money = total output / money supply\nBoth the marginal propensity to consume and the velocity of money affect the multiplier effect. But they have opposite effects. When the marginal propensity to consume is higher, the multiplier effect is higher. When the velocity of money is higher, the multiplier effect is lower.\nSOLUTION: A change in government spending will have a greater short-run impact on real output when the marginal propensity to consume is lower.\nWhen the marginal propensity to consume is lower, people spend a smaller proportion of their income. So, a change in government spending has a smaller effect on consumer spending. As a result, the change in government spending has a smaller impact on real output."}

It is determined in the long run, which is why it is called the long-run aggregate supply curve.\nIn the long run, the quantity of labor and capital available to an economy is determined by the population and the economy's capital stock, respectively. So, the long-run aggregate supply curve is determined by the available labor and capital.\nAn increase in the quantity of labor and/or capital available to an economy will increase its long-run potential to produce goods and services. This will shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.\nA nation that devotes more resources to nondurable consumption goods rather than durable capital goods will increase its demand for nondurable consumption goods. This will increase the prices of nondurable consumption goods and decrease the prices of durable capital goods. However, the prices of capital goods are also an input in the production of capital goods. So, the increase in the prices of capital goods will increase the long-run aggregate supply of capital. The increase in the long-run aggregate supply of capital will offset the decrease in the long-run aggregate supply of consumption goods. As a result, this will not shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.\nResearch that improves the productivity of labor and capital will increase the output for a given amount of labor and capital. This will increase the long-run potential to produce goods and services. This will shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.\nMore restrictive trade policies will increase the prices of goods and services that are imported into an economy. This will decrease the demand for these goods and services. As a result, the long-run aggregate supply curve will shift to the left.\nAnnual limits to immigration of foreign citizens will not affect the long-run aggregate supply curve. This is because immigration affects the labor force, which is one of the inputs into the long-run aggregate supply curve. But the long-run aggregate supply curve is determined in the long run, so it is determined by the available labor force. The available labor force is determined by the stock of foreign citizens in an economy, which is not affected by annual limits to immigration."}

The purpose of a protective tariff is to increase the price of imported goods relative to domestic goods. This makes imported goods more expensive, which reduces the quantity of imported goods sold.\nWhen a protective tariff is removed, the tax on imported steel is removed. This makes imported steel cheaper compared to domestic steel. So, the quantity of imported steel demanded will increase, and the quantity of domestic steel demanded will decrease.\nIncome is transferred from steel consumers to domestic steel producers. When the price of imported steel decreases, steel consumers will buy more imported steel and less domestic steel. So, income is transferred from domestic steel producers to foreign steel producers.\nWhen the price of imported steel decreases, domestic steel producers will sell less steel. So, income is transferred from domestic steel producers to foreign steel producers.\nAllocative efficiency is improved when resources are used to their highest-valued use. Imports falling is an example of allocative efficiency being improved."}

When the value of money declines, people try to spend their money as soon as possible to get goods and services before the value of money falls farther. This rush to spend increases the demand for goods and services, which shifts the aggregate demand curve outward.\nSOLUTION: The real quantity of money is the quantity of money held in the economy. When the real quantity of money increases, people have more money to spend, which shifts the aggregate demand curve outward."}

The model includes two main flows: the flow of goods, services, and resources; and the flow of payments, or money.\nThe flow of goods, services, and resources. Goods and services are produced by firms and sold to households. At the same time, resources, such as labor and capital, are supplied by households to firms.\nThe flow of payments, or money. As goods and services are sold, payments, or money, are sent from households to firms. When resources are supplied, payments are sent from firms to households.\nBoth flows are necessary for the economy to operate. The flows are not separate from each other. They are part of the same circuit.\nSOLUTION: In a private, closed economy, there is no exchange with other countries. So, the most direct exchange in the circular flow model is when households provide resources to firms in exchange for goods."}

This tends to increase the demand for U.S. products, which increases exports.\nIncreasing exports means that the trade surplus (the difference between exports and imports) will increase.\nA trade surplus is a result of exports exceeding imports. So, if the trade surplus increases, the dollar decrease will tend to decrease.\nHowever, if the decrease in the trade surplus is large enough, it could cause the dollar to decrease further."}

It is a positive number.\nThe tax multiplier is defined as the ratio of the change in national income to the change in taxes.\nThe change in national income is given by the formula:\nChange in national income = Taxes \u00d7 (1 - tax multiplier)\nThe change in taxes is given by the formula:\nChange in taxes = Taxes \u00d7 tax multiplier\nSubstituting the formula for the change in national income into the formula for the change in taxes gives:\nTaxes \u00d7 (1 - tax multiplier) = Taxes \u00d7 tax multiplier\n1 - tax multiplier = tax multiplier\nSo, the tax multiplier is a measure of how much national income goes down when taxes go up.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the marginal propensity to consume increases the size of the tax multiplier. This means that when taxes go up, people will consume fewer goods and services. This decrease in consumption will cause a larger decrease in national income than would have happened without the increase in the marginal propensity to consume.\nThe other choices do not affect the size of the tax multiplier.\nAn increase in the reserve ratio does not directly affect the tax multiplier.\nAn increase in the marginal propensity to save does not directly affect the tax multiplier.\nA decrease in the spending multiplier does not directly affect the tax multiplier."}

It tells you how consumers will feel about their current and future financial situations. A change in technology refers to the innovation in new products, production processes, or distribution methods. It affects the cost of production and the quality of goods and services. As a result, a change in technology will affect the aggregate supply curve, not the aggregate demand curve. A change in the money supply can change consumer confidence and affect the interest rate. As a result, it can shift the aggregate demand curve. Spending by state governments affects the aggregate demand curve by affecting government spending."}
{"question": "Which of the following would likely contribute to faster rates of economic growth?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A more restrictive immigration policy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Negative net investment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Higher taxes on households and firms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Higher government funding of research on clean energy supplies"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Faster rates of economic growth are driven by increases in productivity. Productivity can be increased by investing in research on clean energy supplies. This type of investment can lead to the development of new technologies that increase the efficiency of energy production. As a result, more goods and services can be produced with the same amount of input.\nIn contrast, a more restrictive immigration policy, negative net investment, and higher taxes on households and firms are unlikely to contribute to faster rates of economic growth. A more restrictive immigration policy could decrease the number of workers available to businesses, which could decrease productivity. Negative net investment means that the country is spending more money than it is earning, which could decrease the amount of investment available for productivity-increasing projects. Higher taxes on households and firms could decrease the incentives for these groups to invest in productivity-increasing projects."}

When a country buys assets from another country, its capital account increases.\nThe official reserves account represents a country's holdings of foreign currencies. An increase in a country's official reserves indicates that the country's capital account increased, meaning that the country purchased more assets from other countries than it sold.\nThe current account represents the net flow of goods and services into or out of a country. A deficit in the current account means that more goods and services are being purchased from other countries than are being sold to them.

The more deposits that are left with the bank, the more money the bank can create.\nIf households that borrow redeposit the entire loan amounts back into the banks, this does not decrease the fractional reserve banking system's ability to create money. In fact, this increases the total deposits at the bank, which allows the bank to create more money.\nBanks holding excess reserves reduces the fractional reserve banking system's ability to create money. Excess reserves are deposits that are not lent out. The more excess reserves the banks hold, the less money they can create.\nBanks lending all excess reserves to borrowing customers also decreases the fractional reserve banking system's ability to create money. This is because all of the excess reserves would be lent out, which would decrease the amount of money the bank can create.\nIncreasing checking deposits in banks does not affect the fractional reserve banking system's ability to create money. Checking deposits are a type of deposit, but they are not excess reserves. Increasing checking deposits does not change the amount of excess reserves that the banks hold."}

The reserve ratio is calculated by dividing the bank's excess reserves by its deposits.\nExcess reserves are the amount by which a bank's reserves exceed its legal reserve requirement. A legal reserve requirement is a mandatory amount that a bank must hold in reserve.\nSOLUTION: The bank has $500 in deposits and is required to reserve $50. So, the bank has $50 in excess reserves.\nExcess reserves are 90 percent of the deposits. So, the reserve ratio is 90 percent."}

These actions can have a multiplier effect, stimulating or slowing the economy.\nThe multiplier is a measure of how much a change in government spending or taxes affects other areas of the economy. The multiplier is less than one, because each dollar of government spending or taxes affects other parts of the economy.\nSOLUTION: The government spending and taxes will increase by the same amount. So, the expansionary effect of the policy will be equal to the contractionary effect.\nThe expansionary effect is given by the expenditure multiplier. The contractionary effect is given by the tax multiplier.\nSince the expenditure multiplier is 4 and the tax multiplier is -3, the expansionary effect is four times as large as the contractionary effect."}

When the government decreases spending, it takes money out of the economy.\nFiscal policy affects investment by affecting the expected future economy. When the government increases spending on goods and services, it can also increase the expected future economy. This can lead to higher investment. When the government decreases spending, it can also decrease the expected future economy. This can lead to lower investment.\nSOLUTION: An increase in military spending and a tax cut for consumers could increase GDP. The increase in military spending could directly increase GDP, and the tax cut could increase the amount of money consumers have to spend, which could also increase GDP.\nHowever, the increase in military spending could also increase the price level. If the increase in military spending leads to higher demand for labor and resources, the price level could increase.\nThe tax cut could decrease the price level.

{"question": "Expansionary fiscal policy would best be prescribed to", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "eliminate a recessionary gap"}, {"label": "B", "text": "reduce inflation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "reduce the interest rate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "eliminate an inflationary gap"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A government's fiscal policy involves changes in government spending and/or changes in tax rates. Fiscal policy can be expansionary, which means that the government is spending more money or cutting tax rates. Or, fiscal policy can be contractionary, which means that the government is spending less money or raising tax rates.\nMany people believe that expansionary fiscal policy can help to reduce unemployment. When the government spends more money or cuts tax rates, people have more money to spend. This increase in spending can lead to an increase in demand for goods and services. As a result, businesses may need to hire more workers to meet this increased demand.\nThere are many examples of how fiscal policy can affect the economy. For example, during the Great Depression, the US government implemented an expansionary fiscal policy. This policy included the passage of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which was a package of public works projects, agricultural subsidies, and other spending initiatives.\nAs a result of these initiatives, the US government increased its spending and cut taxes. This expansionary fiscal policy helped to reduce unemployment and increase economic growth.\nSOLUTION: To decide what type of fiscal policy is best suited to eliminate a recessionary gap, you need to figure out what type of gap exists. A recessionary gap is a type of macroeconomic gap that appears when actual output is below potential output. Potential output is the level of output that can be sustained over the long term.\nTo eliminate a recessionary gap, the government can use an expansionary fiscal policy. One of the goals of expansionary fiscal policy is to increase demand. By increasing demand, the policy can raise the price level and increase output. This can help to close the recessionary gap."}

It is a downward-sloping curve.\nAn increase in the money supply could cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. This means that for a given price level, the quantity of output that will be demanded will be lower.\nContractionary demand management policies are designed to decrease the level of output and the price level in an economy. These policies can include tax increases and spending cuts. Contractionary demand management policies could cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left.\nExpansionary demand management policies are designed to increase the level of output and the price level in an economy. These policies can include tax cuts and spending increases. Expansionary demand management policies could cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right.\nAn increase in government spending could increase the demand for goods and services. This could cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right.\nSOLUTION: To determine which of these policies could cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left, look at the effect of each policy on the price level and the quantity of output that will be demanded. An increase in the money supply could increase the quantity of output that will be demanded, but it will not affect the price level.

The curve shows the average unemployment rate for the United States from 1948 to the present. The curve shows that unemployment tends to increase during recessions and decrease during expansions.\nBut unemployment is not the greatest threat to the macroeconomy at the peak of a business cycle.\nWhen the unemployment rate is low, many businesses have a hard time finding the workers they need. This can lead to an increase in wages, which can cause inflation.\nInflation is the opposite of deflation. Deflation is a general decrease in prices.\nInflation is the general increase in prices. In an inflationary economy, the value of money goes down. This means that the prices of goods and services also go up.\nThe graph below shows the average annual inflation rate in the United States from 1948 to the present. The inflation rate tends to increase during expansions and decrease during recessions.\nWhen inflation is high, it can threaten the stability of the macroeconomy. If people see that prices are rising quickly, they may decide to spend their money sooner rather than later. This can create a demand pull inflation.\nAlternatively, if businesses see that prices are rising, they may raise their prices to keep up. This can create a supply push inflation.\nSOLUTION: At the peak of a typical business cycle, inflation is the greatest threat to the macroeconomy."}

The curve is named after A.W. Phillips, an economist who first observed the relationship in the 1950s.\nThe Phillips curve shows that there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. When unemployment is low, employers must offer higher wages to attract workers. Higher wages lead to higher costs for employers, which they may pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices. As a result, inflation is usually higher when unemployment is lower.\nSOLUTION: A rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve creates a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This means that unemployment is higher when there is a rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve. At the same time, inflation is also higher.\nAn increase in input costs that corresponds with an increase in unemployment does not create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips curve. This is because the increase in unemployment is not a result of a change in aggregate supply. Instead, it is a result of higher input costs.\nAn increase in output that corresponds with a decrease in the price level does not create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips curve. This is because the increase in output is not a result of a change in aggregate supply. Instead, it is a result of a change in aggregate demand.\nA rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve creates a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This means that unemployment is higher when there is a rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve. At the same time, inflation is also higher."}

So, when prices are high, it takes more money to buy the same goods and services.\nAs a result, inflation can lead to a decrease in real incomes. A decrease in real incomes means that people have less money to buy goods and services after inflation.\nSOLUTION: Inflation can lead to the misallocation of resources. When the inflation rate is high, businesses may have a hard time predicting what their costs will be in the future. This can make it difficult for them to decide which projects to invest in.\nWealth can be redistributed when inflation leads to changes in the distribution of assets. For example, inflation can increase the value of land. This can benefit landowners, while harming people who do not own land.\nHigh inflation can discourage people from saving money.

II. foreigners by less. III. higher prices result in higher interest rates which lower spending.\nThe first rule of economics is that people respond to incentives. When the price level rises, consumers have to use more of their income to buy the same goods and services. So, consumers' incomes cannot go as far now that prices have risen.\nHigher prices also mean that foreigners are by less. This effect is called the purchasing power effect. When prices rise, each currency unit buys fewer goods and services. So, foreigners have to use more of their income to buy the same goods and services.\nHigher prices also mean that higher prices result in higher interest rates which lower spending. When prices rise, the interest rate rises to keep inflation in check. As the interest rate rises, the cost of borrowing money rises. So, businesses and consumers spend less."}

This decrease in productive capacity leads to a decrease in real GDP. Additionally, a decrease in investment can lead to a decrease in the price level. When investment decreases, it reduces the money available to invest in new equipment and buildings, which reduces the supply of goods and services. This reduction in supply leads to lower prices, which decreases the price level.\nA technological advance can increase labor productivity, but it is not a good way to explain a decrease in real GDP and a decrease in the price level. A technological advance can increase the productive capacity of the economy, which can lead to an increase in real GDP. However, a technological advance is not a good way to explain a decrease in real GDP and a decrease in the price level.\nAn uptick in net exports cannot cause a decrease in real GDP and a decrease in the price level. An uptick in net exports can increase real GDP, but it does not affect the price level. An uptick in net exports means that the value of exports increased relative to the value of imports. This increase in exports does not affect the prices of goods and services in the economy."}

This value can change over time, because the prices of goods and services can change.\nThe consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices of goods and services over time. If the CPI increases, then the value of a dollar has decreased. If the CPI decreases, then the value of a dollar has increased.\nYour nominal income is your income before any increases or decreases in the CPI. To calculate your real income, you need to determine whether your nominal income has increased or decreased in terms of the change in the CPI.\nIf your nominal income increases by more than the CPI increases, then your real income has increased.\nIf your nominal income increases by less than the CPI increases, then your real income has decreased.\nSOLUTION: The CPI increases by 2 percent. Your nominal income increases by 8 percent.\nSo, your real income decreases by 4 percent."}

Accounts have different types, or categories.\nOne type of account is a liability account. A liability is an obligation that one party owes to another party. A bank's liabilities are the amounts that the bank owes to other parties.\nSome examples of a bank's liabilities are deposits, which are funds that customers have deposited into their accounts at the bank. The bank owes these funds to its customers.\nRequired reserves are funds that a bank is required to hold in its accounts with the central bank. These reserves are a type of liability, because the bank owes these funds to the central bank.\nExcess reserves are funds that a bank holds in its accounts in excess of the reserves it is required to hold. These reserves are a type of asset, not a type of liability.\nLoans are funds that a bank lends to customers. The bank owes these funds to its customers, so loans are a type of liability."}

This is known as the Phillips curve.\nSo, if the unemployment rate falls, the inflation rate will also fall. And if the unemployment rate rises, the inflation rate will also rise.\nAn increase in aggregate demand means that the economy is growing. When the economy is growing, both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate will usually rise.\nSo, an increase in aggregate demand does not explain the observed trends.\nA decrease in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply would cause the economy to grow at a slower rate. This would cause both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate to rise.\nSo, a decrease in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply may explain the observed trends.\nAn increase in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply would cause the economy to grow at a faster rate.

It shows that, in the short run, inflation and unemployment are negatively related: as unemployment decreases, inflation increases.\nThe curve will shift to the right if there is an increase in the rate of expected inflation. This means that for a given value of unemployment, a higher inflation rate is expected. So, the actual rate of inflation will increase.\nIf prices are expected to rise more slowly in the future, that means that the rate of inflation is expected to decrease. So, the Phillips curve will shift to the left.\nThe actual inflation rate will remain steady unless supply shocks set in. A supply shock is an event that changes the cost of producing goods and services. These shocks can cause the actual inflation rate to increase.\nExpectations can become a reality.

However, the increased competition from domestic producers can also lead to lower prices over time.\nAnother predictable consequence of import quotas is increased government tax revenue from imported goods. When import quotas are imposed, the price of imported goods tends to increase. This can lead to higher tax revenue for the government from import taxes.\nA predictable consequence of import quotas is rising net exports and a rightward shift in aggregate supply. When import quotas are imposed, domestic producers are protected from foreign competition. This can lead to increased production by domestic producers, which can lead to a rightward shift in aggregate supply. Additionally, because import quotas increase the price of imported goods, the quantity of goods imported decreases. This can lead to a higher level of net exports.\nA predictable consequence of import quotas is higher consumer prices and a misallocation of resources away from efficient producers. When import quotas are imposed, domestic producers are protected from foreign competition. This can lead to increased prices for domestic consumers.

The components of the budget are taxes and government spending.\nWhen the government collects more in taxes than it spends on its programs, it is said to have a budget surplus. Some economists believe that a budget surplus can be used to pay down part of the national debt. Doing this can decrease the government's interest payments on its debt, which can increase the government's tax revenue. This increase in revenue can create a positive economic feedback loop that can increase the government's surplus.\nOther economists believe that a budget surplus should be used to increase government spending or to cut taxes. Increasing government spending can increase economic growth, and cutting taxes can increase the incentives for work, saving, and investment.\nOne potential side effect of using a budget surplus to pay down the national debt is that it can decrease the money supply. Money is used to make transactions. When the government pays down its debt, the amount of money in the economy decreases. This decrease in the money supply can cause interest rates to increase.\nAn increase in interest rates can decrease the amount of money people are willing to spend. This decrease in spending can cause the economy to go into a recession."}

This will lessen the impact of an expansionary fiscal policy, which is designed to increase consumption.\nLower interest rates that cause a decrease in net exports decrease the impact of expansionary fiscal policy. This is because a decrease in net exports lowers economic growth, and a smaller economy makes it less effective to use fiscal policy to achieve economic goals.\nHigher interest rates that cause an increase in net exports decrease the impact of expansionary fiscal policy. This is because an increase in net exports raises economic growth, and a larger economy makes it more effective to use fiscal policy to achieve economic goals.\nHigher interest rates that decrease private investment decrease the impact of expansionary fiscal policy.

When interest rates are higher, investment is lower.\nThe crowding-out effect is what happens when government spending pushes up interest rates, leading to a decrease in private investment. The term \"crowding out\" refers to the fact that the government is \"pushing out\" private investors by taking up all of the available cash.\nThe Laffer effect is a theory that says that lowering tax rates can increase tax revenue. This effect is based on the idea that lower tax rates will stimulate investment, which will lead to higher tax revenue.\nFiscal defeat is a situation in which the government must raise taxes or cut spending to keep the budget in balance.\nZero policy effectiveness means that a change in government policy has no effect on the economy.\nSOLUTION: A decrease in real investment stemming from higher interest rates due to government purchases is most commonly called crowding out."}

If wages in a nation are lower, then goods and services from that nation may be more expensive relative to goods and services from other nations. As a result, consumers in other nations may be less likely to buy goods and services from the nation with lower wages, which could worsen the nation's trade deficit.\nAnother way to worsen a trade deficit is to have a higher interest rate on financial assets relative to other nations. A higher interest rate can attract capital from other nations, which may increase the demand for a nation's currency. If the demand for a nation's currency is higher, then the nation's exports may become more expensive for consumers in other nations, which could worsen the nation's trade deficit.\nA higher rate of inflation relative to other nations could also worsen a trade deficit. Inflation makes goods and services more expensive. So, if the inflation rate in a nation is higher than in other nations, then goods and services from that nation may be more expensive relative to goods and services from other nations. This could worsen the nation's trade deficit.\nLower taxes on corporate profits relative to other nations may also worsen a trade deficit. This policy could increase the competitiveness of a nation's companies relative to companies in other nations. If the companies in a nation are more competitive, then they may be able to sell more goods and services in other nations, which could increase a nation's exports and decrease its imports, potentially reducing its trade deficit."}

At the same time, the prices of U.S.-made goods and services become more expensive for foreigners to buy.\nThis appreciation of the U.S. dollar will have different effects on trade and on travel.\nTrade effects: An appreciating dollar will make U.S.-made goods and services more expensive for foreigners to buy. As a result, imports into the United States will decrease.\nOn the other hand, an appreciating dollar will make foreign-made goods and services cheaper for U.S. residents to buy. As a result, exports from the United States will increase.\nTravel effects: An appreciating dollar will make the United States a more expensive destination for foreign visitors. So, fewer foreign visitors will travel to the United States.\nHowever, an appreciating dollar will make the United States a cheaper destination for U.S. residents to travel to foreign countries.

When people and businesses have more money to spend, they can buy more goods and services. This increased spending stimulates businesses to produce more goods and services, which leads to higher employment.\nAccording to Keynes, one of the main ways that spending stimulates the economy is by increasing the marginal propensity to consume. The marginal propensity to consume is a measure of the proportion of an individual's income that they choose to spend. For example, if an individual spends 80% of their income, then their marginal propensity to consume is 80%.\nIn the Great Depression, a sharp rise in the marginal propensity to consume would have led to increased spending and stimulated the economy. This increased spending could have led to higher employment and output.\nHowever, the increase in the marginal propensity to consume did not cause the Great Depression. In fact, the opposite occurred. People and businesses were unwilling to spend, which led to a sharp decline in output and employment.\nToo much investment did not cause the Great Depression. In fact, during the Great Depression, investment was very low. This lack of investment led to a decline in output and employment.\nToo much foreign influence on the economy did not cause the Great Depression. The effects of foreign events on the U.S. economy were moderate during the Great Depression.\nA lack of spending did cause the Great Depression. When people and businesses have more money to spend, they can buy more goods and services. This increased spending stimulates businesses to produce more goods and services, which leads to higher employment. When spending decreases, as it did during the Great Depression, output and employment also decrease."}

An increase in the reserve ratio means that banks are holding a larger percentage of their deposits in reserves. This can reduce the amount of money banks have available to lend.\nSOLUTION: The reserve ratio is 10%. This means that for every $100 in deposits, banks are holding $10 in reserves. If the Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, the deposits held by those banks increase by $1 million. This means that the amount of reserves needed by those banks increases by $100,000.\nIf money demand is perfectly elastic, banks will increase the interest rates they pay on deposits to attract more deposits. The increase in interest rates will increase the demand for deposits, causing the deposits to increase by $10 million. This increase in deposits will increase the money supply by $10 million.\nThe increase in the money supply increases the quantity of money available.

To do this, the central bank can purchase government bonds or make loans to banks. Both of these actions increase the reserves of the banks, which can then be used to make new loans to customers.\nOne of the limits of expansionary monetary policy is that it can lead to an increase in interest rates. This can occur because the increased demand for money by banks to meet their reserve requirements causes interest rates to rise. As interest rates increase, businesses and households may decide to spend less and save more. This decrease in spending reduces the demand for goods and services, which can lead to a recession.\nSOLUTION: The ability of a central bank to conduct expansionary monetary policy is limited when money demand is nearly perfectly elastic. When money demand is nearly perfectly elastic, an increase in the money supply does not lead to an increase in demand for goods and services. This occurs because people carry very little cash, and they are willing to make adjustments to their cash holdings in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, the increase in the money supply does not lead to an increase in aggregate demand.\nHouseholds carrying very little cash holding their money in checking and saving deposits can also limit the ability of a central bank to conduct expansionary monetary policy. When households carry very little cash, they are not able to make purchases with cash. So, an increase in the money supply does not directly increase the demand for goods and services."}

These ways include:\nchanging taxes\nchanging government spending\nchanging the discount rate\nchanging the money supply\n\nHow do these policies affect the economy?\nChanging taxes. Changes in taxes affect consumer and business spending. An increase in taxes decreases consumer and business spending. A decrease in taxes increases consumer and business spending.\nChanging government spending. Changes in government spending affect the economy by affecting the quantity of goods and services produced. An increase in government spending leads to an increase in the quantity of goods and services produced. A decrease in government spending leads to a decrease in the quantity of goods and services produced.\nChanging the discount rate. The discount rate affects the demand for loans. A lower discount rate increases the demand for loans, which leads to an increase in the quantity of goods and services produced. A higher discount rate decreases the demand for loans, which leads to a decrease in the quantity of goods and services produced.\nChanging the money supply. Changes in the money supply affect interest rates and the demand for loans. An increase in the money supply leads to a decrease in interest rates and an increase in the demand for loans. A decrease in the money supply leads to an increase in interest rates and a decrease in the demand for loans.\nSOLUTION: To figure out which policies are most likely to have brought the economy to its current state, consider what was happening before the economy reached its current state. You can use the information in the question to find the answer.\nThe question tells you that the economy is at full employment. This means that there are no unemployed workers and that all of the available resources are being used to produce goods and services.\nThe question also tells you that, in order to reach full employment, the government had to increase its spending and/or decrease its taxes. They did this by increasing government spending and by decreasing taxes.\nSo, the most likely combination of policies to have brought the economy to its current state is an increase in government spending and a decrease in taxes."}

The CPI can be used to calculate the inflation rate, which measures the rate at which the average price level is increasing.\nThe CPI is based on the prices of items that are purchased by consumers. The prices of some items go up over time, and the prices of other items go down. To calculate the CPI, economists measure the prices of the items in the basket and calculate an index that reflects the average price level. The CPI can be used to estimate the change in the cost of living by comparing the index today to the index in the past.\nSOLUTION: The CPI can be used to estimate the change in the cost of living by comparing the index today to the index in the past. If the index today is higher than the index in the past, the CPI overstates increases in the cost of living. If the index today is lower than the index in the past, the CPI understates increases in the cost of living.\nIf the CPI overstates increases in the cost of living, it means that the average price level is increasing more quickly than the actual cost of living. So, the CPI is overstating, or exaggerating, the changes in the cost of living.\nIf the CPI understates increases in the cost of living, it means that the average price level is increasing more slowly than the actual cost of living. So, the CPI is understating, or minimizing, the changes in the cost of living."}

If inflation unexpectedly raises the prices of goods and services, the value of the money the lender receives back is reduced. This is because the money is worth less than it was during the life of the loan.\nBorrowers repaying a long-term loan at a fixed interest rate are not harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation. These borrowers can repay the loan in money that is worth the same as it was when the loan was made.\nSavers who have put their money in long-term assets that pay a fixed interest rate are also not harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation. The money these savers earn from their investments is inflation-adjusted, so it is worth the same as it was when the investment was made.\nWorkers who have negotiated cost-of-living raises into their contracts are not harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation. These workers can earn more money to offset the higher prices caused by inflation.\nRenters of apartments who have signed a lease that holds rent constant for two years are not harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation. These renters can still afford to pay the rent, even if the cost of living goes up.\nSOLUTION: Look at the answer: Lenders are harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation.\nBorrowers repaying a long-term loan at a fixed interest rate are not harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation.\nSavers who have put their money in long-term assets that pay a fixed interest rate are not harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation.\nWorkers who have negotiated cost-of-living raises into their contracts are not harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation.\nRenters of apartments who have signed a lease that holds rent constant for two years are not harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation."}

Prices are set by the interaction of supply and demand in the marketplace.\nWhen demand is strong and supply is limited, prices can rise quickly. High prices, in turn, send a signal to consumers and producers. Consumers may decide to buy less, and producers may decide to produce less. As a result, supplies increase and prices fall.\nSome prices are set by the government. For example, the cost of a driver's license may be determined by the government. In many cases, however, prices are determined by supply and demand.\nSOLUTION: Prices are determined by supply and demand in most cases. When demand is high and supply is low, prices can rise. For example, the price of gasoline tends to rise when demand is strong and supply is limited."}

The Federal Reserve can use open market operations to change the money supply available to banks. When banks have more reserves, they can make more loans. And when they have less reserves, they are more cautious about making loans.\nThe discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Fed. The discount rate affects the interest rates that banks charge their customers. When the discount rate is higher, banks' costs of borrowing from the Fed are higher. So, banks raise the interest rates they charge their customers.\nReserve requirements are the minimum amount of funds that banks must hold in their accounts with the Fed. A decrease in reserve requirements allows banks to lend more money. An increase in reserve requirements makes it harder for banks to lend money.\nSOLUTION: An increase in government spending and the purchase of bonds are two policies that can counter a recession. They increase the money supply and stimulate demand.\nA decrease in taxes can also stimulate demand. But it can also decrease the money supply by decreasing the government's revenue.\nAn increase in the discount rate can decrease the money supply.

To calculate the money multiplier, divide the velocity of money by the reserve ratio. For example, if the velocity of money is 5 and the reserve ratio is 10%, the money multiplier is 5/10% = 50. This means that, with a 10% reserve ratio, a central bank can create 50 times the amount of money in existence."}
{"question": "There is relatively more crowding out as the result of expansionary fiscal policy when", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "expansionary monetary policy accompanies the fiscal policy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the investment demand curve is inelastic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "government spending improves profit expectations among businesses"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the investment demand curve is elastic"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Crowding out occurs when expansive fiscal policy leads to higher interest rates, which in turn reduce investment spending. The greater the effect of the fiscal policy on interest rates, the more crowding out will occur.\nAn expansionary monetary policy accompanies the fiscal policy. This means that the central bank will increase the money supply in order to accommodate the government's increase in spending. This increase in the money supply will lead to an increase in interest rates, which will crowd out investment spending.\nThe investment demand curve is inelastic. An inelastic investment demand curve means that changes in interest rates have a larger-than-normal effect on investment spending. So, if interest rates rise due to crowding out, investment spending will decrease more than it would have otherwise.\nGovernment spending improves profit expectations among businesses. This effect of government spending is called a crowding-in effect, which is the opposite of crowding out. Crowding-in occurs when fiscal policy leads to lower interest rates, which increase investment spending.\nThe investment demand curve is elastic. An elastic investment demand curve means that changes in interest rates have a smaller-than-normal effect on investment spending. So, if interest rates rise due to crowding out, investment spending will decrease, but to a lesser extent than it would have otherwise."}

If the CPI goes from 120 to 150, the average price has risen.\nOne way to describe a change in the average price is to describe what happened to the percent of the average price that each price in the basket of goods represents.\nIf the CPI goes from 120 to 150, the percent of the average price represented by each price in the basket of goods changes. For example, if a good's price was $100 when the CPI was 120, it will be $120 when the CPI is 150. So, the percent of the average price represented by $100 changes from 100/120 to 120/150.\nAn increase in the percent of the average price represented by each price in the basket of goods indicates that prices have risen.

The curve is not a graph of inflation and unemployment themselves. Instead, the curve shows the pattern of changes in inflation and unemployment that are associated with changes in the overall level of economic activity.\nWhen the economy is strong, consumers and businesses spend more, which increases demand for goods and services. This can lead to higher inflation and lower unemployment.\nWhen the economy is weak, consumers and businesses spend less, which decreases demand for goods and services. This can lead to lower inflation and higher unemployment.\nA supply shock is a change in the cost of producing goods and services. A supply shock can lead to higher inflation and higher unemployment.\nA demand-pull inflation is a situation in which the overall level of prices is higher than the level that is consistent with full employment of resources. This can happen when consumers and businesses spend more than they produce.\nA structural shock is a change in the basic structure of the economy. A structural shock can lead to higher unemployment, but it can also lead to changes in the overall level of prices.\nA vertical Phillips curve is a situation in which a change in unemployment has a large and predictable effect on inflation. In this situation, the curve is vertical. This means that the effect of a change in unemployment on inflation is the same each quarter.

It describes how much one's consumption increases when one's income increases. For example, if someone's marginal propensity to consume is 0.9, then for every additional dollar of income they earn, they will increase their consumption by 90 cents.\nThe formula for aggregate demand is a function of the marginal propensity to consume. It tells you how much aggregate demand will increase when there is an increase in income. The formula is:\nAggregate demand = Income + (Income / 1 - MPC)\nSubstituting the formula for aggregate demand into the equation for the change in aggregate demand due to an increase in autonomous private investment gives:\nChange in aggregate demand = $100 / (1 - 0.9) = $190\nSo, $100 of new autonomous private investment would increase aggregate demand by $190."}

As a result, the quantity of output that firms are willing to produce at the higher price level is lower than the previous quantity.\nThere is a tradeoff between the price level and the quantity of output. When the price level is higher, the quantity of output is lower.\nSOLUTION:An increase in the aggregate demand curve shifts the equilibrium to a higher price level and a higher quantity of output.\nThe equilibrium price level increases, and the equilibrium quantity of output increases."}

The world price of a good is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the world market. If the world price of copper exceeds the domestic price, this means that copper is cheaper in the world market than in the United States.\nFor most goods, when the world price exceeds the domestic price, countries are able to earn a profit by exporting the good to other countries. In the case of copper, the United States is a significant producer of copper, and it is likely that the United States would be a net exporter of copper.\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. Imposing a tariff on imported copper would make U.S. copper more expensive compared to world prices. This would likely lead to a decrease in the demand for U.S. copper.\nA tariff can also lead to a trade deficit. A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more goods than it exports. Imposing a tariff on imported copper could lead to an increase in the price of copper in the United States. This could lead to a decrease in the demand for U.S. copper. If the demand for U.S. copper falls, then the United States will import more copper than it exports. This could lead to a growing trade deficit in the United States in goods and services."}

It is also an increase in the quality of goods and services.\nEconomic growth is usually measured by the percentage increase in real gross domestic product (GDP).\nReal GDP is GDP adjusted for inflation. Inflation is the increase in the general price level of goods and services.\nWhen the general price level increases, the value of a dollar decreases. So, to get a measure of the increase in the actual quantity of goods and services produced in the economy, real GDP is divided by the general price level.\nSOLUTION: A faster rate of economic growth would mean a higher percentage increase in real GDP.\nMore investment in capital infrastructure and less consumption of nondurable goods and services would increase the value of GDP. This would increase the number of dollars produced by the economy. An increase in the number of dollars produced by the economy would increase the value of each dollar. So, this choice would increase the general price level. This would decrease the value of a dollar. So, this choice would not increase the standard of living. This choice would also decrease consumption. This decrease in consumption could lead to a slower rate of economic growth.\nElimination of mandatory school attendance laws would increase the quality of human capital in the economy. This could increase the rate of economic growth. But, the actual effect on the standard of living is not clear.\nAnnual limits on the number of foreigners immigrating into the United States would decrease the quality of human capital in the economy. This could decrease the rate of economic growth. But, the actual effect on the standard of living is not clear.\nInstitution of higher tariffs on imported goods would increase the price of goods that are imported into the United States. This would decrease the value of each dollar. So, this choice would decrease the standard of living. This choice would also decrease the quantity of goods and services produced in the United States. So, this choice would decrease the rate of economic growth."}

This can lead to higher output and, therefore, higher real GDP.\nA decline in investment can decrease economic growth. When investment is lower, there are fewer capital goods, such as machines and buildings.

When prices are rising, money can help preserve the value of your income and assets.\nOne way inflation encourages saving is by making each dollar today worth fewer dollars in the future. For example, if you put a dollar in a savings account today and it grows to $1.10 in a year, the inflation rate is 10%.\nAnother way inflation encourages saving is by reducing the purchasing power of the dollar. If you do not save your income today, it will be difficult to buy the same goods and services in the future.\nSOLUTION: Inflation encourages households to save more. If households do not save as much as they did in the past, they will have to cut back on their spending. This can lead to a decrease in aggregate demand and, in the short run, may contribute to economic recessions."}
{"question": "Which of the following fiscal policy combinations would be most likely to slowly increase real GDP without putting tremendous upward pressure on the price level?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increase government spending with a matching decrease in taxes."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Decrease government spending with a matching increase in taxes."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increase government spending with no change in taxes."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increase taxes with a matching increase in government spending."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The key to determining which fiscal policy combination to use is to figure out which policies are most likely to increase real GDP without putting significant upward pressure on the price level.\nFiscal policy can be used to increase real GDP by increasing government spending and/or decreasing taxes. The multiplier effect can be used to determine what part of an increase in GDP will be sustained after the fiscal stimulus is ended. For example, if the government spends $1 billion and households spend $500 million of it, then the multiplier is 1/2. If the government later reduces spending by $1 billion, the multiplier may change, but the sustained increase in GDP will be $500 million.\nThe price level is determined by the interaction of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. An increase in aggregate demand may increase the price level, but it can also lead to an increase in real GDP. However, if the increase in aggregate demand is associated with an increase in the price level that is too high, the result may be inflation.\nSlowly increasing real GDP without putting significant upward pressure on the price level means that the fiscal policy combination must have a high multiplier and a low price level impact. Increasing government spending with a matching decrease in taxes has the highest multiplier of any of the choices. So, this policy combination is most likely to slowly increase real GDP without putting tremendous upward pressure on the price level."}

This increase in the supply of bonds will likely increase the demand for loanable funds.\nLoanable funds is a term used to describe the money available to people and businesses that they can borrow. An increase in the demand for loanable funds means that interest rates are likely to increase.\nWhen interest rates increase, the real interest rate also increases. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation.\nHigher interest rates make investment in new projects more expensive.

An increase in the reserve ratio means that banks are required to hold more reserves for every deposit they have. This will cause banks to have less money to lend, which will reduce the money supply and interest rates. As a result, excess reserves in the banking system will increase.\nChecking deposits are deposits that can be used to make purchases or pay bills. An increase in checking deposits means that more money is being held in the banking system. This increase in the money supply will cause interest rates to decrease. As a result, excess reserves in the banking system will increase.\nThe discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from their regional Federal Reserve Bank. An increase in the discount rate means that it will be more expensive for banks to borrow money. This will cause banks to have less money to lend, which will reduce the money supply and interest rates. As a result, excess reserves in the banking system will increase.\nThe Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks. When the Fed sells securities to banks, it receives payment from the banks. This payment reduces the banks' reserves. As a result, excess reserves in the banking system will increase."}
{"question": "Which of the following statements is true of production possibility curves and trade between nations?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nations specialize and trade based on absolute advantage in production."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Free trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The flow of goods and services is based on the principle of absolute advantage."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nations can consume at points beyond the production possibility curve by protecting domestic industries from free trade."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Production possibility curves illustrate the trade-offs a nation faces between producing two or more goods. These trade-offs result from the fact that a nation has limited resources, and each nation has an absolute advantage in producing some goods, but not in producing all goods.\nAn economy can produce a set of goods that lies within its production possibility curve. The farther a nation specializes in producing a particular good, the more of that good it can produce with a given amount of resources. But specializing in the production of a particular good means that the nation must produce less of other goods.\nA nation can consume goods that lie beyond its production possibility curve. It can do this by trading with other nations. Trading nations can specialize in the production of goods that they have an absolute advantage in producing and trade those goods for goods that they have a absolute disadvantage in producing. Doing this allows trading nations to consume goods that lie beyond their own production possibility curves.\nFree trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve. This means that nations can specialize in the production of goods that they have an absolute advantage in producing and trade those goods for goods that they have a absolute disadvantage in producing.\nProtecting domestic industries from free trade can help an economy maintain employment in the industries that are protected. However, this policy can also prevent an economy from taking advantage of its absolute advantage in other industries. So, this policy can limit the consumption an economy can achieve."}

The following are some of the main functions of money:\nMedium of exchange. A medium of exchange is a common tool that people can use to trade with each other. Money is a medium of exchange.\nUnit of account. A unit of account is a standard measure of value. People can use a unit of account to compare the value of different things. In many countries, the unit of account is the same as the medium of exchange. In the United States, for example, the medium of exchange is the dollar, and the unit of account is also the dollar.\nStore of value. A store of value is a way to store money so that it keeps its value over time.\nTransfer of ownership. A transfer of ownership is a change in the possession of an object. When you buy a 20-ounce bottle of pop, the transfer of ownership occurs as you hand over the money to the seller.\nSOLUTION: The function of money that defines how a 20-ounce bottle of pop costs $1.25 is the medium of exchange.\nThe medium of exchange function of money defines how money is used to buy things.

One way to do this is to increase the incentives for businesses to invest in new capital and distribute goods and services.\nHigher taxes on corporate profits would reduce the incentives for businesses to invest in new capital and would decrease the supply of goods and services. So, this policy would not be supported by supply-side economists.\nRemoval of investment tax credits would reduce the incentives for businesses to invest in new capital and would decrease the supply of goods and services. So, this policy would not be supported by supply-side economists.\nA longer duration of unemployment benefits would increase the incentive for people to remain out of work and decrease the supply of labor. So, this policy would not be supported by supply-side economists.\nLower tax rates on interest earned from savings would increase the after-tax return on saving and investment, which would increase the incentives for businesses to invest in new capital and would increase the supply of goods and services.

{"question": "To close a recessionary gap", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the right."}, {"label": "B", "text": "the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right."}, {"label": "D", "text": "the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the left."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The economy is always on the verge of moving into a new equilibrium, with the current equilibrium being the one in which the actual values of the variables are equal to the equilibrium values of the variables. One of the variables in the economy is the interest rate, which is the price of borrowing money. When the interest rate is high, it is relatively expensive to borrow money. When the interest rate is low, it is relatively inexpensive to borrow money.\nOne way to close a recessionary gap is to decrease the interest rate. This makes it less expensive to borrow money, which increases the demand for borrowing. In turn, this increases the demand for goods and services, which shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. This increase in demand leads to a higher level of actual output and a smaller real interest rate.\nSOLUTION: To close a recessionary gap, the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the right. This can be achieved by using expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy.\nExpansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending on goods and services. This increase in government spending shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right.\nExpansionary monetary policy involves decreasing the interest rate. This decrease in the interest rate shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right."}

If either the price or the quantity expected by buyers increases, the equilibrium price will fall and the equilibrium quantity will rise.\nSOLUTION: In the future, if producers of good A expect the price to be higher, they will be willing to charge a higher price today. So, the equilibrium price will rise. At the same time, the producers will also be willing to sell less of the good. So, the equilibrium quantity will fall."}

This measurement is made in real terms, which means that the value of GDP is measured in a specific year's dollars. For example, in 2012, the United States produced $16.3 trillion worth of goods and services. If prices in 2012 are the same as prices in 2007, the real GDP in 2012 is equal to the real GDP in 2007.\nIf technology makes production less expensive, the increase in output for a given amount of inputs will increase real GDP. So, real GDP will increase.\nIf exports decrease, the increase in real GDP from the increase in output will be smaller than it would have been without the decrease in exports. But, the decrease in exports will not necessarily cause real GDP to decrease. So, real GDP will decrease with certainty.\nThe price level is a measure of the average price of all goods and services in an economy. A change in the price level indicates a change in the general level of prices in an economy. For example, if prices in a country increase, the price level will increase.\nA decrease in exports will not necessarily cause the price level to decrease.

To do this, the government decreases its spending and/or increases its taxes.\nCanceling the annual cost of living adjustments to the salaries of government employees would not decrease the amount of money in circulation. This policy would actually increase the amount of money in circulation, because the government would be spending more money.\nIncreasing income taxes would decrease the amount of money in circulation. This policy would decrease the amount of money that people have to spend, save, or invest.\nDecreasing money spent on social programs would decrease the amount of money in circulation.

This increase in demand can raise the prices of goods and services, making consumers and firms spend less.\nThe other choices are not definitions of crowding out.\nFiscal policy is so effective in part because it can stimulate aggregate demand without crowding out.\nInterest rates falling due to government borrowing does not cause consumers and firms to spend less.\nSOLUTION: When interest rates fall, the cost of borrowing money decreases. This can stimulate consumers and firms to borrow more money and spend it. So, interest rates falling due to government borrowing does not cause consumers and firms to spend less.\nCrowding out can occur when the government competes with consumers and firms for borrowed funds.\nA decrease in the money supply caused by the government's borrowing does not necessarily cause consumers and firms to spend less.\nSOLUTION: When the government competes with consumers and firms for borrowed funds, the interest rates that consumers and firms pay may increase.

One reason is lower interest rates in the United States relative to China. When interest rates are lower in the United States than in China, capital tends to flow from China to the United States, which can cause the value of the dollar to appreciate relative to the yuan.\nAnother reason is lower price levels in China relative to the United States. If prices are lower in China than in the United States, traders can make a profit by buying goods in China and selling them in the United States. This trade can increase the demand for the yuan and decrease the demand for the dollar, which can cause the value of the yuan to appreciate relative to the dollar.\nA growing American preference to consume more Chinese-made goods could increase the demand for the yuan and cause its value to appreciate relative to the dollar.\nRising per capita GDP in China increasing imports from the United States could increase the demand for foreign currencies, including the yuan, which can cause its value to appreciate relative to the dollar."}
