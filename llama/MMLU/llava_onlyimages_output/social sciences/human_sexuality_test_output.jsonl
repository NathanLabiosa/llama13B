These methods include mammography and computed tomography (CT).\nMammography is a type of imaging test that uses radiation to produce detailed images of the breasts. The amount of radiation used in a mammogram is small. But since mammograms are performed on both breasts, the overall amount of radiation is larger than that from a single x-ray.\nComputed tomography (CT) is a test that uses radiation to produce detailed images of structures within the body. CT scans of the breast are not common. But they may be used to evaluate a breast lump or other abnormality.\nOther methods of detecting breast cancer do not involve exposure to radiation. These methods include needle aspiration and lumpectomy.\nNeedle aspiration involves using a thin needle to remove a small amount of tissue from the breast. This test does not use radiation.\nLumpectomy is a type of breast surgery that involves removing a lump from the breast. This test does not use radiation.\nSOLUTION: Mammography involves exposure to radiation. No other methods of detecting breast cancer involve radiation."}

{"question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk. You also briefly considered studying for this test, but Jacques won out. In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the id"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the ego"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the superego"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the Oedipus complex"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The human psyche is composed of three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego.\nThe id is the most primitive and instinctual part of the psyche. It is the source of our basic desires and needs.\nThe ego is the part of the psyche that is responsible for dealing with reality. It is the center of our consciousness and the part of our psyche that communicates with the outside world.\nThe superego is the part of the psyche that includes our conscience. It is the part of our psyche that evaluates our actions and behaviors.\nThe Oedipus complex is a Freudian concept. It refers to a stage of development in which a child begins to develop a desire for their opposite-sex parent. According to Freud, this desire is caused by the child's desire to be the opposite sex and to marry their same-sex parent.\nSOLUTION: In Freudian terms, the id is the dominant force when a person gives in to their primitive desires and needs. The superego is the dominant force when a person follows the rules of society and does what they believe to be right. The ego is the dominant force when a person makes a conscious decision that balances their primitive desires with the rules of society. The Oedipus complex is not a part of the psyche. It is a stage of development. It is not a force that can be dominant."}

But being homosexual is not the same as having homosexual tendencies.\nAnd playing with toys typical of one gender is not a good way to predict sexual orientation. People are not born with a set of preferences, but with an open mind. Their surroundings and experiences help them decide what they like and what they don't like.\nIf Bruce and Chuck both enjoyed playing with toys typical of their gender, this would not be very surprising. Many children who later turn out to be heterosexual enjoyed playing with toys typical of their gender as children. Similarly, many children who later turn out to be homosexual enjoyed playing with toys typical of the other gender as children."}

{"question": "Which of the following characteristics are generally consistent with date rape?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "use of excessive force"}, {"label": "B", "text": "premeditated"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sexually motivated"}, {"label": "D", "text": "involves use of a weapon"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Date rape is a form of sexual assault. It is characterized by the use of coercion or manipulation to force someone to have sex.\nThe use of excessive force is consistent with date rape. This means that forcing someone to have sex through the use of physical violence is a form of date rape.\nPremeditated means that the attacker thought about and planned the assault before it happened. This does not necessarily mean that the attacker gave himself or herself time to \"cool off.\" Instead, premeditated just means that the attacker made a deliberate decision to rape the victim.\nSexually motivated means that the attacker was motivated by a sexual desire. This does not necessarily mean that the attacker was physically attracted to the victim. Instead, sexually motivated means that the attacker wanted to have sex with the victim.\nInvolves use of a weapon means that the attacker used a weapon to threaten or intimidate the victim. This does not necessarily mean that the attacker had to use the weapon to harm the victim. Instead, the attacker could have used the weapon to make the victim do what he or she wanted."}

F. Skinner"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Havelock Ellis"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: According to Freud, humans have a need for pleasure and a need to avoid pain. Pain is a warning signal that tells an organism to stop doing something. So, if a woman or man repeatedly experiences pain during intercourse, she will probably want to have intercourse infrequently or not at all. Classifying this pain as a punishment is a way of understanding the pain in terms of its role in satisfying psychological needs.\nMoney believed that pain during intercourse could be a signal that a woman was punishing her partner for something he had done outside of the bedroom. Money did not believe that pain during intercourse was a punishment for something that had happened during the sexual experience.\nSkinner focused on the relationship between behavior and environment. Pain during intercourse is a consequence of certain sexual behaviors. According to Skinner, people are likely to change their behavior if it has undesirable consequences. So, if a woman or man repeatedly experiences pain during intercourse, they are likely to change their sexual behavior to avoid the pain.\nEllis was a physician who believed that many psychological issues were caused by social factors, such as a lack of privacy. He did not believe that pain during intercourse was a punishment for something that the woman or her partner had done."}
{"question": "What seems to be the case when the folk saying \"opposites attract\" (i.e., dissimilar attitudes tend to cause liking) when it is considered in light of current research?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It does not seem to be true."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It seems to be true for heterosexuals but not for homosexuals."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It seems to be true for homosexuals but not for heterosexuals."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It seems to be true for women but not for men"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The folk saying \"opposites attract\" does not seem to be true when it is considered in light of current research.\nThe idea that opposites attract is based on the theory of complementarity, which suggests that people are attracted to those who have qualities that they lack. This theory seems to be supported by data showing that people who differ in personality traits, values, or interests are more likely to marry and stay married.\nHowever, more recent research has called into question this classic view. Studies have found that people are more likely to be attracted to those who are similar to them in various ways, such as in values, interests, and personality traits.\nThese findings are consistent with a theoretical framework called the similarity-attraction effect. This framework suggests that people are drawn to others who are similar to them because they feel comfortable with those people and can predict how they will behave.\nIt does not seem to be true for women but not for men.\nThe idea that opposites attract is often used to describe heterosexual relationships. So, it is not surprising that this folk saying does not seem to be true for women but not for men.\nIt does not seem to be true.\nThe theory of complementarity and the folk saying \"opposites attract\" do not seem to be true when considered in light of current research.\nIt seems to be true for homosexuals but not for heterosexuals.\nIt is important to note that the research on attraction and relationships is often focused on heterosexual couples. So, it is not surprising that this folk saying does not seem to be true for homosexuals but not for heterosexuals."}

Fertilization usually happens in the fallopian tube, which is a structure that carries eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.\nAfter a sperm fuses with an egg, the fertilized egg begins to divide and grow into a embryo. This process is called conception.\nThe embryo then travels to the uterus, where it implants in the lining of the uterus. This process is called implantation.\nSOLUTION: An egg can be fertilized until about 72 hours after ovulation.\nOvulation is the process by which a mature egg is released from an ovary. It usually happens about 14 days before the start of a woman's next period.\nSo, for a woman who ovulates on the 14th day of her menstrual cycle, fertilization can happen from about the 10th day to the 17th day of her cycle."}

During the plateau phase, the penis continues to fill with blood as sexual arousal continues. Filling with blood causes the penis to move from soft to hard. Orgasm happens when the muscles in the penis contract. This contraction is called an orgasm.\nImmediately before orgasm, the muscles at the base of the penis begin to contract. This is called the pre-orgasmic contraction.\nDuring the plateau phase, the penis is fully erect. The plateau phase is the phase in which the penis remains at its hardest.\nPrior to vasocongestion, the penis is not erect. Erection begins with the vasocongestion, or the filling of the penis with blood.\nFollowing orgasm, the muscles at the base of the penis are contracted. This is called the orgasmic contraction."}

{"question": "An adult feels himself becoming aroused when looking at a child and realizes that the response is totally inappropriate, as a result he feels anxiety rather than arousal. This is an example of __________ according to Walen and Roth's cognitive model of the sexual response.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "negative perception"}, {"label": "B", "text": "negative evaluation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "negative arousal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "cognitive dissonance"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: According to Walen and Roth's cognitive model of the sexual response, both cognitive processes and physiological processes are involved in sexual response. The model includes excitation, which is the physiological response, and attraction, which is the cognitive response.\nAttraction is the process of interpreting sensory cues and selecting whether a potential partner is attractive. For an adult to find a child attractive would be inappropriate. So, in this example, the adult has a negative evaluation of the situation.\nNegative evaluation is a crucial step in the model. It refers to the cognitive process of thinking about a potential partner and forming an opinion about that partner. In the example, the adult has a negative evaluation of the situation.\nNegative arousal is a type of negative outcome. It occurs when the response is not what the person wanted. In the example, the adult feels anxiety rather than arousal.\nCognitive dissonance is a type of negative outcome. It occurs when a person has two or more incompatible beliefs or values. In the example, the adult feels anxiety because he has two incompatible beliefs: he wants to be aroused, but he also wants to be appropriate.\nAn example of a positive outcome is positive arousal. This occurs when the response is what the person wanted.\nFor a cognitive model, a cognitive process is a specific type of thinking. For Walen and Roth's model, the specific cognitive processes are attraction and negative evaluation.\nAttraction is the process of interpreting sensory cues and selecting whether a potential partner is attractive.\nNegative evaluation is the process of thinking about a potential partner and forming an opinion that the partner is not desired."}

When a person agrees with us, we experience a positive feeling. This positive reinforcement makes us feel good about the person and about our own attitudes.\nBolstering our sense of rightness is another reason why we are attracted to people who are similar to us in attitudes. When someone who is similar to us in attitudes agrees with us, it bolsters our sense that our attitudes are right. This bolstering makes us feel more strongly about our own attitudes.\nWe can anticipate positive interactions with someone who is similar to us in attitudes. When we interact with someone who is similar to us in attitudes, we can expect to have pleasant and enjoyable conversations.\nAll of the above reasons help to explain why we are attracted to people who are similar to us in attitudes."}

It does not mention the homosexuality concordance rate for adoptive brothers.\nThe concordance rate is a measure of how often the sexual orientations of twins match. The study found that the homosexuality concordance rate for identical twins is 100%. This means that if one twin is homosexual, the other will also be homosexual.\nThe study also found that the homosexuality concordance rate for identical twins is higher than for fraternal twins. This means that identical twins are more likely to both be homosexual than fraternal twins are to both be homosexual."}
{"question": "The capacity of a spinal-cord injured man to have erections depends on:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the level of the spinal cord at which the injury occurred"}, {"label": "B", "text": "whether the spinal cord was partially or completely severed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the man's age"}, {"label": "D", "text": "both a and b"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The ability to have an erection requires nerves and blood vessels that are intact. So, the capacity of a spinal-cord injured man to have erections depends on the level of the spinal cord at which the injury occurred and whether the spinal cord was partially or completely severed.\nIf the injury occurred at or above the level of the pubic symphasis, the man is likely to have erectile dysfunction (ED). The pubic symphasis is the point at which the pubic bone begins to widen. This is because nerves and blood vessels that are important for erections are damaged at this level or above.\nIf the injury was below the level of the pubic symphasis, the man is unlikely to have ED. This is because the nerves and blood vessels that are important for erections are still intact.\nWhether the spinal cord was partially or completely severed can also affect the man's ability to have erections. With a complete sever, the man is likely to have ED. With a partial sever, the man may or may not have ED.\nThe man's age does not affect his ability to have erections."}

A feedback loop does this by looking at the output of a system and using that information to influence the input.\nOne example of a feedback loop is the one that regulates the production of sex hormones in men. This feedback loop includes five components:\n1. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH) is released by the hypothalamus. GNRH stimulates the pituitary gland to produce two hormones: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).\n2. LH and FSH are released by the pituitary gland. Together, these hormones stimulate the testes to produce testosterone.\n3. Testosterone is released by the testes. Testosterone inhibits the production of GNRH by the hypothalamus.\n4. Oxytocin is not involved in the feedback loop that regulates the production of sex hormones in men.\n5. The feedback loop is closed when levels of testosterone in the blood decrease. This decrease in testosterone levels inhibits the production of GNRH.\nSOLUTION: The feedback loop in men that regulates the production of sex hormones includes GNRH, LH, FSH, and testosterone. It does not include oxytocin."}

It starts on the first day of bleeding and ends when an egg is released.\nDuring the follicular phase, a group of eggs grow in follicles. One of the eggs becomes dominant. This dominant egg is released from the ovary during ovulation.\nThe luteal phase is the second part of the menstrual cycle. It starts after ovulation and ends with the shedding of the uterine lining.\nIf the egg is not fertilized, the uterus sheds its lining, causing bleeding. This shedding is called menstruation.\nIf the egg is fertilized, it may implant itself in the uterus. Then, the body prepares to support a pregnancy. This preparation includes the growth of a thick uterine lining.\nThe thick uterine lining is needed to support a fertilized egg. It may not be needed if the egg is not fertilized. So, the uterus sheds the lining during the luteal phase.\nSOLUTION: The luteal phase follows ovulation. So, the shedding of the uterine lining described in the question happens during the luteal phase."}

It asks about the attitudes of people with liberal attitudes about premarital sex. It does not talk about their behaviors.\nExamples of behaviors are accidental extramarital sexual activity and engaging in open swinging. These are not about attitudes. They are about actions.\nAttributes are used to describe things. An attribute of an attitude is that it is liberal. An attribute of an action is that it is accidental.\nSo, having liberal attitudes about extramarital sex and engaging in accidental extramarital sexual activity are not the same.\nSome people with liberal attitudes about premarital sex may engage in accidental extramarital sexual activity. But liberal attitudes about extramarital sex are not the only factor that leads to accidental extramarital sexual activity. Other factors include taking birth control and being drunk.\nOpen swinging is a behavior. It involves engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners outside of a traditional monogamous relationship.\nLiberal attitudes about premarital sex are not the same as engaging in open swinging.\nSome people with liberal attitudes about premarital sex may engage in open swinging. But liberal attitudes about premarital sex are not the only factor that leads to open swinging. Other factors include being part of a subculture that values open swinging and having a high degree of sexual curiosity."}

This procedure is usually done as a permanent form of birth control.\nVasectomy does not affect a man's ability to have an orgasm or to experience sexual pleasure. Ordinarily, a man can still have a normal orgasm after a vasectomy.\nThe testicles continue to produce testosterone and other male hormones after a vasectomy. A vasectomy does not affect the production of male hormones.\nSperm production can be affected by a vasectomy. A vasectomy usually results in a decrease in sperm production. But, it usually takes some time for sperm production to decrease after a vasectomy.\nThe vas deferens are the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles. During a vasectomy, the vas deferens are cut. This prevents sperm from leaving the testicles. Usually, sperm cannot get into the semen after a vasectomy. But, it is important to note that it takes time for the vas deferens to heal after a vasectomy. While it is healing, some sperm may be present in the semen. It is important to use another form of birth control until a man has negative semen tests after a vasectomy."}

Intercourse, or sexual intercourse, is how a man and a woman become partners in making a baby.\nMany couples have questions about how to conceive. One question is about the best position for intercourse.\nHere are some things to know:\nSperm can live for up to 5 days in the body. This means that having intercourse several times during the week when a woman is fertile can increase the chances of conception.\nFertility awareness is a method of birth control that involves tracking the days of the month when a woman is fertile. To do this, you need to know when ovulation occurs. Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovaries.\nOvulation usually happens in the middle of the menstrual cycle. But the exact day of ovulation can vary from woman to woman.\nIf you are trying to conceive, having intercourse on the days when a woman is most fertile can increase the chances of conception. This is usually within a day or two of ovulation.\nThere is no evidence that position during intercourse has a consistently significant effect on the likelihood of conception. But some couples find it helpful to use different positions to optimize sperm delivery.\nHere are some things to consider when trying to conceive:\nSOLUTION: There is no evidence that position during intercourse has a consistently significant effect on the likelihood of conception.

A supervisor has power over a subordinate, and using that power to harass a subordinate can affect the subordinate's career or job security.\nIf Danny has previously told Sandy that he does not appreciate her advances, that could be a important factor in determining whether Sandy's comment is harassment. But it is not the only factor.\nIf Danny responds with \"Sure baby your office or mine?\", that could be a response to Sandy's comment, but it does not change the fact that Sandy is Danny's supervisor. So, this response would not make the comment into open and welcome flirting."}

It is often described as a cycle with four stages: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.\nExcitement is the first stage of the sexual response cycle. During this stage, sensory input (such as touch or kissing) triggers a cascade of physiological responses, including increased heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure.\nThe plateau is the second stage of the sexual response cycle. During this stage, the body's physiological responses increase slowly and steadily. This stage may include intense sexual pleasure.\nThe orgasm is the third stage of the sexual response cycle. During this stage, the body's physiological responses reach their highest point. Orgasm is marked by a sudden release of tension, and it may include intense pleasure.\nThe resolution is the fourth stage of the sexual response cycle. During this stage, the body's physiological responses begin to return to baseline levels. This stage may include feelings of relaxation and well-being.\nSOLUTION: Erection in the male and vaginal lubrication in the female mark the excitement stage of the sexual response cycle."}

This theory says that the reason animals have sexual behavior is to produce offspring.\nAnother theory is that the function of sex is to maintain the double standard. The double standard is a set of social rules that apply to men and women differently. For example, the double standard says that men should court women, and women should court men. The theory says that sex is used to follow the rules of the double standard.\nA third theory is that the function of sex is to relieve tension.

But generally, sexual addicts feel a sense of relief and emptiness after they have completed a sexual act. This emptiness can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair.\nSome sexual addicts are able to use fantasy to replace the feelings of emptiness with feelings of arousal. This is a temporary fix and does not address the root cause of the addiction.\nFor many sexual addicts, the act of sexual activity does not provide long-lasting emotional intimacy or connection. So, after the act, they may feel relaxed and emotionally relieved. But this relief is usually short-lived, and the addict may again feel a sense of emptiness.\nSOLUTION: Look for the answer that is not supported by the question. The question asks about the experiences of a sexual addict after completing a sexual act. It does not matter what the sexual addict feels immediately after the act."}

{"question": "How many centimetres must the cervix dilute to before a baby can be born?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10"}, {"label": "C", "text": "15"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The cervix is the neck of the uterus. It may be as long as 40 centimeters before childbirth.\nDuring childbirth, the cervix must get longer and open to allow the baby to pass through the birth canal. This process is called dilation.\nDilation can cause discomfort, but it usually does not hurt.\nThe cervix can dilate up to 10 centimeters before the baby is born.\nThe distance from the cervix to the baby's birth canal is called the station.\nDuring labor, the station may decrease as the cervix dilates. This is because the cervix is at the top of the uterus and the baby is at the bottom of the uterus.\nSo, for a baby to be born, the cervix must dilate to 10 centimeters."}

{"question": "Attachment to a care-giver begins:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "in the hours immediately following birth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "several weeks after birth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "several months after birth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "when the child learns to speak"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Attachment is a bond that forms between two people. It is formed through interactions.\nAttachment begins in the hours immediately following birth. A newborn baby needs to be cared for by an adult. The baby's cries will trigger caring behaviors in the adult. Over time, the baby comes to learn that when they need something, their caregiver will respond. This forms the basis for attachment.\nBabies who are separated from their mothers after birth may become distressed. They may be inconsolable until they are reunited with their mothers. This is called attachment behavior. It begins in the hours and days immediately following birth."}

A blastocyst is a small ball of cells that has just formed from an embryo. The word \"blastocyst\" may be hard to say, but it is important to understand that embryos need a few days to reach this stage.\nIn the past, doctors could not identify the stage of an embryo until 28 days after conception. But today, ultrasound can be used to identify the stage of an embryo. Many fertility clinics use ultrasound to guide embryo transfer.\nSOLUTION: A blastocyst is about 2 centimeters long when it forms. So, by 28 days after conception, the embryo is about 2 centimeters long."}
