'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Liberalism is a political philosophy that believes in the free market and minimal government intervention.\nWhen it comes to energy security, a liberal perspective is likely to focus on the global economy and the role of markets in ensuring energy security. A liberal is likely to argue that the global economy is interconnected, and that energy security for one country is dependent upon energy security for all countries. This means that all countries have a shared interest in maintaining and extending the conditions that allow for the free flow of oil and other energy resources. As long as the global economy exists, a liberal would argue, conflict between countries over energy reserves is unlikely.\nA liberal would also argue that the market is the most efficient way to allocate resources. This means that a liberal would be in favor of policies that promote the free flow of oil and other energy resources. For example, a liberal would support policies that encourage the development of new energy sources, such as solar or wind power, but would not support policies that attempt to conserve energy or restrict the use of fossil fuels.\nA statistic is a set of data. Statistics can be used to describe a population.\nImagine a population of daffodil plants. To describe this population, you could gather data on the height and number of leaves on each plant. This data would form a set of statistics.\nThe mean is a measure of the average value in a set of statistics. The mean is determined by adding up all the values in the set of statistics and dividing by the number of values.\nFor example, consider the following statistics:\n10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45\nThe mean is 27.5.\nTo figure out the mean, first add up all the values in the set of statistics. Then divide the sum by the number of values. In this case, the mean is 27.5.\nThe median is a measure of the middle value in a set of statistics. The median is determined by ordering the values in the set of statistics and selecting the middle value.\nFor example, consider the following statistics:\n10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45\nThe median is 27.\nTo figure out the median, order the values in the set of statistics.

The way in which security is conceptualized affects what is seen as security issues and what is considered legitimate. The three approaches to environmental security presented earlier in this chapter contest the traditional security perspective in different ways.\nAn ecological security approach to environmental security challenges the assumptions of the traditional security perspective. This approach argues that the primary threats to security are environmental, that is, ecological, and that these threats disproportionately affect marginalized people. To address these threats, this approach calls for a fundamental shift in the way we think about security.\nA human security approach to environmental security challenges the assumptions of the traditional security perspective. This approach argues that the primary threats to security are the erosion of livelihoods and the denial of human dignity. Environmental degradation is seen as a symptom of insecurity, and addressing environmental issues is seen as part of addressing human security.\nA cosmopolitan security approach to environmental security challenges the assumptions of the traditional security perspective. This approach argues that states should take responsibility for the security threats that they create in other states. This approach links human security and environmental security, arguing that environmental security threats undermine human security and that addressing these threats is part of addressing human security."}

Thus, IFIs adopted an approach that involved political and economic restructuring of these states, coercing governments into the adoption of specific financial policies designed to promote debt repayment and economic development."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The World Bank and IMF are international financial institutions (IFIs). IFIs are different from other types of international organizations, such as the United Nations, in that they specialize in one area. In the case of IFIs, this area is finance.\nThe main role of IFIs is to provide loans to countries. In exchange for these loans, countries are expected to use the money to achieve specific economic goals. For example, a country might be expected to use the money to improve its transportation system. Or, a country might be expected to use the money to increase its tax revenue.\nOne of the main ways that IFIs affect the development of poorer countries is by offering loans to them. Poorer countries can use the money from these loans to fund development projects. These projects may include things like building roads, improving health care, or increasing access to education.\nIn order to get a loan from the World Bank or IMF, a country must be willing to commit to certain economic policies. These policies are designed to promote economic growth and stability. Examples of these policies might include reducing government spending, controlling inflation, or liberalizing trade."}

This process requires that the securitizing actor claim that the threat is real, that it is urgent and immediate, and that it is important enough to justify extraordinary measures.\nThe general public must be convinced of the legitimacy of the proposed threat. This is necessary for the issue to be securitized. But granting the securitizing actor the special rights requested is a matter of political decision-making. So, the audience may be convinced by the speech act or the securitizing actor, but fail to grant that actor the special rights requested. In this case, the issue may not be securitized."}

It has the potential to offer many benefits, but it also has costs and challenges.\nOne of the main benefits of globalization is the sharing of ideas, technologies, and resources. This can include medical advancements, new technologies, and improved farming practices. These advancements can directly benefit human security by improving health, safety, and quality of life.\nAnother potential benefit of globalization is the growth of a global consumer culture. This can include the sharing of popular culture, such as music and movies. This growth has the potential to promote a more global sense of community.\nA global market that has demonstrated the ability to reduce poverty and make substantial economic gains is also a benefit of globalization. The increased trade can raise living standards and create new jobs.\nHowever, globalization is a complex process that is influenced by many different factors. It is not a process that is always benevolent, and it can also have negative outcomes. For example, globalization can lead to the redistribution of wealth, but this can also result in growing disparities in economic and resource allocation. This can lead to social and political tensions, including the possibility of diplomatic fallout.\nThe growing sense of global community, resulting in super-national identities, is another potential outcome of globalization. However, this outcome is difficult to achieve, and it is also difficult to predict what the long-term impacts of this outcome might be."}

The Great Law was established around the year 1142 and was based on a philosophy of peace and unity. The laws were created to ensure the survival of the tribes and to promote peace between them.\nThe Great Law is a challenge for traditional security studies because it represents a proven non-state approach to security. It is an example of how a society can maintain peace and security without a centralized government or a standing army.\nThe case of the Great Law illustrates the importance of being critical of practices of research and knowledge production.

A thick space is a dense set of constructed political, economic, social, military and cultural relations that are generated by the knowledge and practice of Western powers to favor the so-called third world. It is a space that is heavily marked by colonial relations, which are often organized by the ways in which Western powers have treated non-European peoples.\nThick spaces are places that are marked by colonial power relations. They are not just physical places, but social and cultural constructs that reflect power relations.\nThick spaces can produce hierarchies among countries. For example, the international system of states is a thick space. It is a system that is organized around the principles of sovereignty and state-to-state relations. This system produces hierarchies among countries. For example, some countries have more power in this system than others."}

Violent acts can be committed by a range of different actors, including non-state actors and state actors.\nThe state is the most prominent institution for addressing violent acts and protecting human security. But, as the United Nations and other international organizations are important to provide a broader perspective and to help coordinate international action, including in cases where states are a major part of the problem.\nThe state has the greatest material resources and power to secure the human referent object. This includes not just military resources, but also resources for diplomacy, development, and other forms of assistance.\nIn the short term it is unhelpful to adopt a hands-off states and policy approach, as there are many current crises in which people need immediate relief from atrocities.

Thus, their behaviour is dictated by economic considerations."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Economic security is about ensuring states and other actors have access to the resources they need to survive and thrive. Behaviour is important because it can tell you how actors will act in response to particular circumstances.\nEconomic security analysis can usefully incorporate insights from the science of economics. Economics is the study of how individuals make deccisions. This can help you understand how states or other actors will behave when they have to make choices.\nFor example, economic security analysis might look at how states' decisions about their economies will affect their security. This could include how states will behave in the trading system, or how they will manage their domestic economies to promote economic growth.\nIn this way, the study of economics can help you understand, predict, and respond to the behaviour of states and other security actors."}
{"question": "What long-term trends can be foreseen in the concept of environmental security?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "In the post-9/11 reversion to traditional security thinking, environmental security as a concept is likely to enjoy continued attention from security analysts and policymakers."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increasing evidence of the negative effects of environmental insecurity may increasingly govern national security interests and behaviour.

In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Environmental insecurity is a growing concern for many countries. It is defined as the inability of the environment to support human needs and aspirations. This can result from the effects of social, economic, and political structures on the environment.\nThe concepts of traditional security and environmental security are not mutually exclusive. Environmental issues could be framed as threats to the survival of societies. As such, they fall within the remit of traditional security. For instance, the devastating effects of climate change on communities and the subsequent migration could increase tensions and potential conflicts.\nStates have the primary responsibility for ensuring the well-being of their citizens. Environmental security is therefore their concern. As Cooley (1984) notes: \u201cthe state is the only body that can use the institutionalized means of violence to achieve its goals\u201d.\nStill, states cannot address environmental security alone. They need to collaborate. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) was formed in 1974. It aims to coordinate the environmental activities of the United Nations organizations and to raise awareness of environmental issues. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was signed in 1992. It aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.\nThe European Union (EU) was founded in 1993. Its primary focus was on reducing the barriers between the member states. It now addresses other issues, such as environmental security. The EU has a military, the European Defence Agency, and its own diplomatic corps. It also has an increasing level of defense spending.\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) also has implications for environmental security. For example, the organization\u2019s agreements on agriculture and on the environment could affect the practices of member countries.\nIn 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It contains a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a call to action by all countries to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.\nThe concept of environmental security is linked to the traditional concept of security. But the environmental security of a country is affected by the environmental security of other countries. So, some issues may require international cooperation."}

It is rooted in the idea that the effects of colonialism are pervasive and continue to shape the world today.\nColonized discourse involves the imposition of ways of thinking about the world that reflect the values and interests of the colonizing power. This discourse can establish notions of inferiority and superiority about different states, and it can continue to influence the behavior of states long after formal colonial rule has ended.\nThe fact that colonized discourse can continue to influence the behavior of states is one reason why colonial power exists only through the military actions of occupying states. This statement is true.\nThe military actions of occupying states can maintain the military, political, and economic superiority of the occupying power. This superiority can then be used to shape the discourse that defines the behavior of the occupied state.\nThe end of the Second World War marked the beginning of the dissolution of the British Empire. This event was significant in the history of colonialism, but it did not end colonialism.\nThe legacy of colonialism is a central concern of postcolonialism. This legacy includes the ways in which colonialism can continue to shape the world long after the end of formal colonial rule.\nEuropean practices of free trade and democracy were central to the project of colonialism. It is hard to argue that these practices are best suited to creating a peaceful and stable international system."}

As human populations increase, they compete for the same resources, leading to conflicts over land, water, and other vital resources. In addition, as resources become scarce, states may use force to secure access to them. For example, water scarcity has been identified as a major source of conflict in many parts of the world.\nFurthermore, the consequences of environmental degradation can include the loss of land, water, and other resources that are vital to human societies. This can lead to conflict over access to these resources. For example, sea level rise threatens coastal populations' access to land and water, which can lead to conflict over these resources.\nFinally, environmental constraints can limit economic growth, which can lead to social unrest and conflict."}

{"question": "When considering the international system from a realist perspective, which of the following statements concerning the advent of war is true?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour."}, {"label": "B", "text": "War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass."}, {"label": "C", "text": "War is more likely when the offence-defence balance of the international system favours offence, thus creating a more competitive environment for states."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of these options."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Realist theories of international relations predict that states engage in war when they perceive that their survival is at stake. A state's survival is at stake when its power is declining, and its ability to protect itself from attack has diminished. This can increase its motivation to engage in aggressive behavior.\nA multipolar international system is a system in which several states have the ability to influence the system's outcome. In such a system, states may have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass: that is, to use other states to do their fighting for them. This can increase the likelihood of war.\nThe offence-defence balance of the international system refers to the relative ability of states to attack and defend. A balance that favors offense increases the competitiveness of the system, which can increase the likelihood of war.\nThe first statement explains the motivation for a state to engage in war. The second and third statements describe other aspects of the international system that can affect the likelihood of war. The fourth statement is not necessarily true. It is possible that war is less likely when a state is losing power, for example, if the state can rely on allies to help it deter attack."}

However, this can later be combined with other approaches, including social constructivism, in order to consider the security of different referent objects such as the environment or human security."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Social constructivism is an approach to international relations that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. It is based on the idea that they are the primary drivers of change in international politics. According to this approach, the world is not fixed and given, but is rather a social construct, and as such, it is created and re-created through the interactions of individuals and groups.\nSocial constructivists reject the foundations of realism upon which military security studies are based. Realism is a theory of international politics that sees the world as made up of anarchy, where states are in a state of nature and are always in need of maximizing their security. In this context, military power becomes a means of ensuring security.\nAccording to social constructivists, the world is not made up of anarchy, but is rather a social construct. The security concerns of states and the military strategies they adopt are shaped by their social and cultural context. For example, the security concerns of a state are influenced by the state's history, its political and economic system, and its culture.\nSocial constructivists argue that military security is not just a matter of military power, but is a social construct. They argue that military power is not the only means of ensuring security. Broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations."}

Ambiguity in societal identity can make security dilemmas more difficult to manage.\nThe question tells you that ambiguity in societal identity can stem from two sides of nationalism: cultural and ethnic. Ethnic nationalism is often described as more malign and linked to state disintegration, whereas cultural nationalism is often seen as benign, working within existing state structures.\nCultural nationalism may sometimes be compelled to change itself from a solely cultural movement into a political movement and be conflated with political nationalism. This can make it more difficult to determine whether a society is being driven by cultural nationalism or ethnic nationalism.\nDominant actors may exaggerate threat perceptions with the intent of mobilizing political support which can result in action-reaction processes.

The term primarily refers to the ways in which states conceptualize their own military capabilities with regards to those around them."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Both realists and liberal internationalists view the international system as anarchic. The realist perspective, however, is that international politics has been characterized by a security dilemma from its inception.\nThe security dilemma is a central concept in realist theory. It refers to the belief that military capabilities of states will always be a source of insecurity, because other states will perceive these capabilities as a threat. So, the more that any one state invests in military capabilities, the more other states will feel threatened, and the more they will invest in their own military capabilities. This can lead to an arms race, which can be expensive and destabilizing.\nThe security dilemma has implications for other sectors of security, such as the political and societal security sectors. For example, the military sector can impact on the political sector, because a state with a large military may use it to coerce other states. The security dilemma can also have implications for civil liberties, because states may feel compelled to increase security measures to protect their societies.\nThe term security dilemma can be used to describe a wide range of phenomena. At one extreme, it can be used to describe a situation in which states are threatened by other states' military capabilities. At the other extreme, it can be used to describe a situation in which states are threatened by other states' military, economic, or political actions."}

The question asks you to determine which statement is not applicable to the Securitization process. The Securitization process involves the use of language to secure resources, audience, and cooperation. The process includes the following elements: the securitizing actor, the relevant audience, the language of securitization, and the adoption of extraordinary measures.\nThe statement that is not applicable to the Securitization process is: Within authoritarian and other undemocratic regimes, the relevant political decision-making is often dominated by the military and political elite. This statement is not applicable to the Securitization process because it does not relate to the use of language to secure resources, audience, and cooperation.\nThe other statements are applicable to the Securitization process. The statement Securitization reveals the power of the securitizing actor is applicable to the Securitization process because it shows how the use of language can reveal the power of the securitizing actor.\nThe statement The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat is applicable to the Securitization process because it shows how the use of language can convince an audience of an existential threat.\nThe statement Where the securitizing actor is a democratic state, the relevant audience is usually the wider population who have the right to reject the speech act is applicable to the Securitization process because it shows how the relevant audience can reject the speech act."}

Some of the things that are considered legitimate targets include enemy military forces, enemy weapons, and enemy infrastructure such as dams or power plants.\nIllegitimate targets, on the other hand, are things that it is not acceptable to attack. Civilians and civilian infrastructure are considered illegitimate targets.\nThe concept of legitimate targets has changed over time. In the past, wars were often fought between professional armies. In these types of wars, legitimate targets were largely limited to enemy military forces and enemy weapons.\nBut in more recent conflicts, non-state groups have often been the adversaries. These groups often do not have a formal military and may not wear uniforms. In these cases, it has been more difficult to determine which targets are legitimate.\nThe new terminology of RMA is one way to think about the ethics of targeting in the era of non-state adversaries. This new terminology focuses on the concept of precision.\nA precision attack is an attack that is designed to hit a specific target. Precision attacks are considered to be more ethical than indiscriminate attacks. An indiscriminate attack is an attack that is not focused on a specific target. Indiscriminate attacks are considered to be less ethical than precision attacks.\nA smart bomb is a type of precision bomb. A smart bomb is guided to its target. This guidance can be based on a variety of factors, such as radar or lasers.\nSurgical strike and precision target are two more phrases that refer to precision attacks."}

This means that what people feel threatened by and how they try to get protection from those threats is a matter of interpretation. Different social groups may have different ideas about what they need to be secure.\nSome people argue that security is mainly about the survival of the state. They believe that the state should be the referent object to be secured using extraordinary measures where possible. Others argue that security is a matter of personal survival and that individuals should be the primary focus of security efforts.\nA constructivist approach to security involves understanding how the ideas and actions of different social groups affect the construction of security. Threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures.\nIf security is a socially constructed concept, then it exists as an empirically verifiable and independent condition that changes only slightly, if at all, with regards to the social context in which it is applied."}

Accepting that there can be no absolute security is a wise approach to cybersecurity. Instead, it is important to design resilient IT systems and to build international cooperation and information exchange in order to reduce the threat and increase resilience.\nPublicising and acting upon instances of cyber warfare can help to identify and respond to cyber threats. This can help to reduce the impact of cyber warfare as a threat.

{"question": "In what ways might international measures be employed? Are they a help or a hindrance?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Diplomacy cannot achieve agreements among small groups of nations where global agreements have failed. Global endorsement is required to legitimize the process, providing greater cooperation, agreements and great power backing. Failure to attain global consensus on what terrorism is will result in disparities between states' counterterrorism methods which will severely reduce the scope of employing multi-level measures in a consistent and cohesive fashion, and may afford some terrorist groups the opportunity to seek refuge in states whose domestic laws are weaker."}, {"label": "B", "text": "A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it. However, these efforts have largely faltered: countries often support or sympathize with dissidents who use violence against repressive governments; governments in developing countries have wanted to avoid anti-colonial struggles being labelled as terrorism; and countries want to retain a degree of flexibility regarding extradition and punishment of political dissidents."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Intelligence agencies are highly centralized, organized structures that operate at a maximum functional level within their domestic context. There is no reason to presume that collaboration would enhance their ability to contribute to the prevention of terrorism. The multi-agency approach would also broaden the scope for potential errors, miscommunication, and intelligence failures."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Multi-partner initiatives to support the reforms necessary for the prevention of terrorism have proved ineffective. Sanctions against countries that provide a territorial base for terrorism may be misplaced, having negligible effects on the terrorist organizations themselves."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Diplomacy can be an effective tool to build consensus and cooperation among nations. International measures are most effective when they have broad global support. Measures that do not have this support can be a hindrance because they may be viewed as illegitimate or overly intrusive by the nations they are intended to affect.\nFor example, the United Nations is an international organization that aims to promote cooperation and diplomacy among nations. The UN can be a forum for nations to negotiate and agree on international measures to address terrorism. But the UN can be effective only if nations choose to participate and follow its guidance.\nThe effectiveness of diplomacy in countering terrorism also depends on the goals of the nations involved. If some nations do not support the use of force to counter terrorism, diplomacy may be the only way to address the issue. But diplomacy can be a slow and difficult process, and it may not always result in agreements."}

These are the three ways in which security studies can broaden its agenda. Questioning the dominance of liberalism and realism in the international system, applying critical knowledge to the security dilemma faced by states, and redressing the power imbalances that lead to intra-state conflict are not the ways in which security studies can broaden its agenda. Expanding the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects would not attract scholars to the field of security studies.

In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Anarchy means that there is little continuity in a government's foreign policy over time. Leaders come and go and their foreign policy changes, which is reflective of different preoccupations and ideologies."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anarchy means that the structure of the international system is distinctive because states have a strong sense that they are part of a larger entity in international politics with overarching interests and goals, making association unlimited and important."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: In the realist view, anarchy is the absence of a strong, overarching power to enforce rules and establish order. Without such a power, each state must fend for itself. This means that states cannot rely on others to protect them, and they must be self-reliant in their pursuit of security."}

In the realm of international relations, liberalism emphasizes the importance of international regimes.\nAn international regime is a set of formal or informal principles to which governmental actors subscribe in their decision-making on a particular subject. These regimes can include formal organizations, such as the United Nations, as well as informal understandings between states.\nInternational regimes are independent bodies established by a collaboration of governmental and non-state actors to oversee international decision-making processes.

The question is whether gender is applicable to this field.\nThe answer is that gender is applicable to Security Studies. Both biological differences and social constructions of masculinity and femininity determine the roles that men and women are expected to act out. By considering these roles, Security Studies can ask important questions about the ways in which we conceptualize security.\nFor example, Security Studies can examine how the social construction of femininity affects the ways in which women are expected to act in matters of security. Women are often socialized to be cooperative and nurturing. These socializations can affect how women approach matters of security. For instance, women are often more likely to prioritize the security of children and the elderly.\nIn contrast, the social construction of masculinity often teaches men to be aggressive and dominant. This socialization can affect how men approach matters of security. For example, men are often more likely to prioritize the security of the state over the security of children and the elderly.\nBy examining these social constructions, Security Studies can explore how they affect the ways in which men and women approach matters of security."}

Public sector redundancies and salary freezes lead to fewer teachers and doctors."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Massive redundancies and increased unemployment with no social security provision push families deeper into poverty. Farmers and small companies can no longer afford to borrow money and are forced to reduce production or go out of business."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of these options."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Common structural adjustment policies affect the poor in various ways.\nThese policies affect the poor in many ways, so it is important to consider the specific policies that are in question.\nImposing taxes on goods and services raises the cost of imports. This makes goods and services more expensive, which puts more pressure on household budgets.\nHigher prices for basic foods can increase the number of people who do not have enough food to eat.\nReducing spending on health, education, and social welfare programs can make these important services less accessible to the poor.\nIntroducing user fees for healthcare and education can make these services too expensive for many people to afford.\nMassive redundancies and increased unemployment can leave many people without a source of income. This can push families deeper into poverty."}
{"question": "How might the diversity of the current global international system impact upon the case for humanitarian intervention?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The global political arena is dominated by a paradigm of human-security which promotes human security based on core assumptions of what it is to be secure, and which transcend cultural or political diversity."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Despite the inclusion of a diverse range of political actors, whose cultural, ethical and religious values are often at odds with one another, there exists a general consensus amongst all states that humanitarian intervention is sometimes justified."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The diversity of states, in terms of their cultural, political, ideological and religious values, results in a global system characterised by radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other.

In order to protect this diversity, there exists a need for unifying principles of humanitarian intervention."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Humanitarian intervention is sometimes justified, but it is also a controversial issue. The debate over humanitarian intervention is complex and contested, and there are a number of different perspectives on the issue.\nSome states and political actors argue that humanitarian intervention is sometimes justified. They contend that when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its own citizens from widespread and severe harm, other states have a moral obligation to intervene to protect those citizens. This view is based on the core assumption that it is better to protect human beings from harm.\nOther states and political actors are more skeptical of humanitarian intervention. They argue that humanitarian intervention can undermine the principles of state sovereignty and non-interference. These states contend that the international community should not intervene in the domestic affairs of other states, no matter how severe the human rights abuses or humanitarian crises.\nThe global political arena is dominated by a paradigm of human-security which promotes human security based on core assumptions of what it is to be secure, and which transcend cultural or political diversity. This paradigm has contributed to a greater acceptance of humanitarian intervention by most states.\nThe diversity of states, in terms of their cultural, political, ideological and religious values, results in a global system characterised by radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity, there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention.\nWithin the contemporary global arena there are a number of radically different views on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity, there exists a need for unifying principles of humanitarian intervention."}

{"question": "To what extent have biological agents been weaponized?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Construction of the means to transmit biological weapons in warfare has focused on the use of vectors, for example lice, fleas, or mosquitoes, as a mode of transmission as a military weapon. These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Inoculation programs against naturally occurring disease have eradicated the potential for viral agents to cause a global pandemic. Vaccination capabilities have undermined calls for the weaponization of viral agents made by some military strategists as most public health authorities have in place programs to deal with a possible outbreak."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The development and construction of a weapon can take many years. The duration of the development and construction process for biological agents varies depending on the agent. For some agents, the process can take less than a year, while for others, it may take more than a decade. The amount of time needed to develop a biological agent as a weapon is often called the agent's weaponization time.\nAlthough some biological agents can be weaponized, many experts believe that the risks of weaponizing biological agents outweigh the potential benefits. For example, the weaponization of biological agents could lead to accidental releases or intentional use, which could have serious health consequences."}

HIV/AIDS undermines the human capital of a state, which can have serious long-term consequences, including a reduction in economic productivity, social instability, and increased health care costs. HIV/AIDS can also threaten the state indirectly by causing a decline in the economy, for example, by reducing the workforce, increasing health care costs, and decreasing consumer spending."}

The security context in which armed forces operate is characterized by physical and sociological conditions that may exacerbate the threat of disease. This includes, for example, crowded or unsanitary living conditions, limited access to potable water and health care, and the psychological and social stresses of combat.\nThe perception of diseases as national security threats is partly a matter of framing. Fear of infectious diseases can be used to justify actions that are unrelated to disease control, such as war or forced displacement. The rhetoric of security also lends urgency to calls for action, which can be beneficial in the case of infectious diseases, where prompt action can be life-saving.\nGlobalization is an accelerant of infectious diseases. The globalization of travel and commerce has already caused a significant increase in the spread of diseases that were once considered under control.\nThe physical health of armed forces is a paramount concern within the traditional security paradigm, and the threat of disease is exacerbated by the physical and sociological conditions under which military personal operate, particularly during combat."}

Some NGOs focus on arms control, which is the regulation of the international trade in weapons.\nThe role of NGOs in the global defence trade is to use their expertise to advise governments on arms control and to monitor the implementation of arms control agreements. Some NGOs also work to raise public awareness of the harm caused by the international trade in weapons."}

Rather, we are talking about the type of human condition that a society is striving to achieve. The question tells you that development refers to the human condition in which there is freedom from fear and want. This means that development is about more than just economics. It is about making life better for people.\nThe question also tells you that there is a consensus that certain core values are essential to the human condition. These core values include freedom from fear and want. This consensus defines the criteria that must be met in order for a society to be considered developed.\nThe criteria for what constitutes a developed state are defined by the requirements of interaction in the global state system.

In limited force, the purpose is to attain the coercer's interests, not to destroy the adversary. The adversary has some choice about how to respond. In full-scale war, the purpose is to destroy the adversary's will or ability to resist. The adversary does not have much choice about how to respond.\nThe choice about whether to use limited force or full-scale war is based on the potential costs and benefits of each type of force. Limited force is intended to achieve the coercer's interests at a lower cost than full-scale war. But limited force might not work. So, the coercer might have to resort to full-scale war."}
