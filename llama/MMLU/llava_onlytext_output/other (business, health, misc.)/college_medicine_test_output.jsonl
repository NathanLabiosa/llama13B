{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": ""}

An enzyme helps chemical reactions occur without being used up in the process.\nEnzymes have an active site, a region on the enzyme where the substrate binds. The active site and substrate are shapes that fit together.\nIf a substrate binds to the enzyme's active site, the enzyme and substrate form an enzyme-substrate complex. The enzyme's active site and substrate are the right shape to fit together.\nThe enzyme-substrate complex is called a transition state. When the substrate is in the transition state, the chemical reaction is ready to occur.\nThe enzyme helps to lower the activation energy needed to start the chemical reaction. The activation energy is the energy that must be added to the substrate to start the chemical reaction. Without the enzyme, the chemical reaction would not occur at a normal rate.\nCompetitive inhibition occurs when a substrate binds to an enzyme's active site and also to the inhibitor. The inhibitor and substrate are shapes that fit together. When the inhibitor and substrate are bound to the enzyme's active site, the inhibitor and substrate are in the same shape. This shape is called a complex inhibitor.\nThe complex inhibitor fills the enzyme's active site, so it cannot be filled by substrate. This competitive inhibition lowers the rate of the chemical reaction. The competitive inhibitor is a slow-binding inhibitor because it takes time to fill the enzyme's active site.\nNoncompetitive inhibition occurs when an inhibitor binds to an enzyme's active site. The inhibitor is not a substrate. The inhibitor and substrate are not the same shape. When the inhibitor is bound to the enzyme's active site, the inhibitor is a different shape than the substrate. This shape is called a complex inhibitor.\nThe complex inhibitor fills the enzyme's active site, so it cannot be filled by substrate. This noncompetitive inhibition lowers the rate of the chemical reaction. The noncompetitive inhibitor is a fast-binding inhibitor because it does not take time to fill the enzyme's active site.\nIrreversible inhibition occurs when an enzyme is broken or damaged. An irreversible inhibitor does not stop being an inhibitor after it leaves the enzyme's active site. An irreversible inhibitor keeps the enzyme from working after it leaves the enzyme's active site.\nPartially competitive inhibition can occur when a small molecule becomes bound to an enzyme's active site. When the enzyme's active site is filled with a substrate, a small amount of the inhibitor is able to bind to the enzyme's active site. This fills the enzyme's active site with a complex inhibitor. So, the rate of the chemical reaction is lower."}

{"question": "During muscular contraction, interactions between myosin and actin allow for shortening of each sarcomere.

This theory states that myosin and actin slide between each other during muscle contraction.\nAnimal cells have a number of types of myosin. The myosin that is found in muscle cells is called myosin II. Myosin II interacts with actin to form a cross-bridge.\nWhen a muscle cell receives a signal to contract, calcium ions bind to proteins called troponins. This bindings causes a change in the structure of the troponin-tropomyosin complex. This change allows the troponin-tropomyosin complex to move south on the actin filament. This movement brings the myosin-binding sites on the actin filament past the myosin cross-bridges.\nThe myosin cross-bridges then bind to the actin binding sites. This binding causes the myosin to change conformation, or shape. This conformation change is called the power stroke. The power stroke causes the myosin head to detach from the actin binding site.\nThe myosin-actin detachment is necessary for muscle contraction. It is driven by the actin-binding heads of the myosin cross-bridges. The heads move away from the actin binding site, shortening the myosin. This shortening pulls the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere.\nTropomyosin-troponin interaction and calcium-troponin interaction are part of the changes that occur before the myosin-actin detachment. In the tropomyosin-troponin interaction, the troponin-tropomyosin complex moves south on the actin filament. In the calcium-troponin interaction, calcium ions bind to troponins. These bindings cause a change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex."}

Each type of fiber uses energy differently.\nType I fibers are used for endurance activities. The muscle uses oxygen to break down glucose and make energy. This type of fiber is slow-twitch and can use energy efficiently for long periods.\nType II fibers are used for short, explosive activities. The muscle uses anaerobic (without oxygen) energy systems to break down glucose and make energy. This type of fiber is fast-twitch and can make energy quickly, but it tires very quickly.\nSOLUTION: Creatine kinase helps move creatine phosphate into cells. When cells need energy, they break down creatine phosphate into creatine and phosphorus. This reaction releases energy that is used by the cell.\nThe activity of creatine kinase increases when intracellular ADP rises.\nIntracellular ADP is inside the cell. When ADP levels in the cell rise, creatine kinase is used to help move ADP into cells.\nThe activity of creatine kinase is increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9.\nMuscle cells convert glucose to energy. When muscle cells use up all the glucose, they produce lactic acid as a waste product. Lactic acid makes the muscle environment too acidic. Creatine kinase can help move ADP into cells when the muscle environment becomes too acidic.\nThe activity of creatine kinase is always lower in Type II fibers than Type I fibers.\nType II fibers use anaerobic energy systems. Creatine kinase can help move ADP into cells when oxygen is not available. Type II fibers have fewer mitochondria, which are the parts of cells that use oxygen to make energy. So, Type II fibers cannot use oxygen to make energy. They use anaerobic energy systems, which do not use creatine kinase.\nThe activity of creatine kinase increases after a period of endurance training.\nAfter a period of endurance training, the muscle has more Type I fibers. These fibers use creatine kinase to make energy."}

But surfactant can help lower the surface tension.\nWhen surfactant is produced, it coats the inside of the lungs. This coating helps to keep the air sacs open. When you inhale, the air sacs fill with air. When you exhale, the air sacs empty."}

The amount of energy expended depends on the type of exercise and the duration of the exercise.\nCalories are a unit of energy. The number of calories expended by the human body during exercise depends on the type of exercise and the duration of the exercise. For example, running for 1 calorie expends more energy than walking. Running for 1 calorie expends more energy than sitting down.\nSOLUTION: To determine how many kJ of energy are expended during exercise, you need to know the type of exercise and the duration of the exercise.\nIf an athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes of exercise, the athlete's oxygen uptake is 3.0 liters in 5 minutes, or 0.6 liters per minute.\nThe rate of oxygen consumption is a good indicator of how many calories are being expended. Every person has a different number of calories that are expended for a given rate of oxygen consumption. So, the number of kJ of energy expended for a given rate of oxygen consumption can be different from person to person.\nFor example, one person's rate of oxygen consumption is 0.6 liters per minute. This person expends 5.0 milliliters of oxygen per minute.\nThis person expends 5.0 milliliters of oxygen per minute \u00d7 114 kJ/milliliter = 570 kJ of energy per minute.\nSo, this person expends 570 kJ of energy in 5 minutes."}

During exercise, your body needs carbohydrates to provide energy for your muscles.\nExercise performance is directly affected by the type and amount of carbohydrate in your diet. Eating a diet that is low in carbohydrates has several possible effects on exercise performance:\nGreater reliance on muscle glycogen: When you have a low intake of carbohydrate in your diet, your body has less glycogen to draw on during exercise. Glycogen is a type of carbohydrate that is stored in your muscles. Your body uses glycogen as a source of energy during exercise.\nIf your body has less glycogen, it must rely more on the glycogen stored in your muscles. This greater reliance on muscle glycogen may impair your high-intensity exercise performance.\nImpaired high-intensity exercise performance: A low-carbohydrate diet may impair your high-intensity exercise performance. This is because a low-carbohydrate diet reduces the amount of glucose that is available to your muscles.

Phosphocreatine can quickly donate energy to muscle cells, helping to power short, intense bursts of exercise.\nAfter exercise, the body can resynthesize creatine from the leftover phosphocreatine. This resynthesis process requires energy, which is provided by the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). As ATP is broken down, it is converted into adenosine diphosphate (ADP).\nA shortage of oxygen can limit the rate at which ATP is broken down to provide energy for resynthesis. As a result, the recovery of muscle function after exercise is delayed.\nSOLUTION: An excess of oxygen will inhibit phosphocreatine resynthesis. During exercise, the body has a limited number of oxygen molecules available to use for energy. If there are too many oxygen molecules around, the body will use oxygen instead of phosphocreatine to provide energy for muscle cells. This will delay the recovery of muscle function after exercise."}

These signals are sent along the length of a neuron's branches, or dendrites, to the cell body, or soma, and then along the longest branch, or axon.\nAn action potential is a brief change in voltage, much like a brief change in voltage in a electrical wire. When the voltage change, or potential difference, reaches a certain level, the action potential ends. The potential difference spreads down the branch, and when it reaches the end of the branch, the action potential evaporates.\nAn action potential is called a depolarization if it starts at a more negative potential.

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nWhich of the following is a likely paragraph that follows this excerpt in the article?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "A paragraph on a protein that facilitates intracellular function in response to heat."}, {"label": "B", "text": "A paragraph on increased heart attacks in Eskimo populations."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A recap of Finland\u2019s water polo team excellence."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A study on rats exposed to high levels of heat."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": ""}

Cells use energy from food to do their work.\nCellular respiration is the process by which cells get energy from food. Cellular respiration involves chemical reactions that break down food and release energy that the cell can use.\nThere are three main steps in cellular respiration:\n1. Glycolysis: The breakdown of glucose.\nGlycolysis begins when cells take in glucose. Glucose is a type of sugar that is used by cells as food. Cells break down glucose during glycolysis, and this breaks releases energy that the cell can use.\n2. The conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA: Fatty acids are broken down into acetyl CoA.\nCells also break down fatty acids, which are a type of fat, during cellular respiration. When cells break down fatty acids, they are broken down into acetyl CoA.\n3. The tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle): The citric acid cycle.\nAcetyl CoA produced in the previous step is broken down in the citric acid cycle.

The weight you use must be heavy enough to challenge your muscles.\nMuscle growth and strength development occur in response to the overload. Your muscles grow in size and become stronger so that they are able to lift heavier weights.\nMany factors can affect your 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) lift, including muscle size, muscle contractility, and nervous system signals.\nThe relationship between these factors and your 1-RM lift can be described by the following formula:\n1-RM = (muscle mass) x (contractility) x (nervous system signals)\nYou can increase any of these factors to increase your 1-RM lift.\nMuscle mass: Lifting weights can increase muscle mass. As your muscles get bigger, they can lift more weight.\nContractility: Contractility is a measure of a muscle's ability to get shorter and generate force. Some factors that can increase contractility include strength training, nerve stimulation, and protein in your diet.\nNervous system signals: Your nervous system sends signals to your muscles to lift weights. As you get stronger, your nervous system signals can improve, which can increase your 1-RM lift.\nSOLUTION: Increasing the protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength.\nThe text cites a study of young men who increased their protein intake to 2.3 grams per kg body mass per day. The men in the study increased their strength by 23% after three months."}

Glycolysis releases energy from the sugar glucose, and part of the release of energy is used to produce ATP, the energy currency of the cell.\nWhen muscles need to contract quickly, they can use a special high-energy compound called phosphocreatine. Phosphocreatine shares an energy atom with ADP, a molecule that is part of the ATP molecule. This sharing allows creatine phosphorylation to quickly produce ATP.\nThe initial energy for muscle contractions comes from the breakdown of ATP. When the muscle contracts, ATP is broken down into ADP. The two ATP molecules can combine with the ADP to form two ATP molecules. This process, called substrate-level phosphorylation, happens within the muscle cell.\nThe muscle cell can also get energy from glycolysis. When one molecule of glucose is broken down, two molecules of ATP are produced. This process happens in the bloodstream outside the muscle cell.\nSOLUTION: Initial energy for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds is from phosphocreatine stores. These stores are used up quickly."}

This process, called cellular respiration, produces energy that the cell can use to function. The breakdown of sugar produces lactate, which is a waste product.\nLactic acid is a strong acid that, when produced in the body, can make the blood too acidic. This can be dangerous, as nerve cells in the brain and muscles require a slightly alkaline environment to function properly. To keep the blood safe for nerve cells, the body has a system for removing lactic acid.\nOne way lactic acid is removed is by being converted back into sugar. This process, called lactate metabolism, happens mainly in the liver. The liver removes lactic acid from the blood and converts it back into sugar. The sugar is then used by the body for energy.\nAnother way lactic acid is removed from the body is by excretion. The kidneys filter the lactic acid from the blood and excrete it in the urine.\nSOLUTION: Lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle by diffusing through the cell membrane.\nMuscle cells need more oxygen when they exercise. When oxygen levels in the muscle get too low, the muscle breaks down sugar without using oxygen. This process, called anaerobic respiration, produces lactate.\nLactate and hydrogen ions can harm the muscle, so muscle cells have a way to get rid of them. The lactate and hydrogen ions diffuse out of the muscle and into the blood. In the blood, lactate can be used by other parts of the body for energy."}

When ATP is broken down, it releases energy that can be used to drive muscle contraction.\nThere are three ways that ATP can be broken down to release energy:\n1. Aerobic respiration: This process can be used to release energy from food. It involves breaking down glucose and releasing energy over a long period of time. Aerobic respiration relies on oxygen.\n2. Anaerobic respiration: This process can be used to release energy from glucose without oxygen. Anaerobic respiration releases energy much faster than aerobic respiration, but it also creates more waste products.\n3. Phosphocreatine breakdown: This process can be used to release energy quickly. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound found in muscles. When a muscle contracts, phosphocreatine can be broken down to release energy.\nSOLUTION: Muscle contraction is powered by ATP. When ATP is broken down, it releases energy that can be used to drive muscle contraction. This breakdown is called oxidative phosphorylation."}

To keep this information organized, DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones. The resulting structure, a nucleosome, is the basic unit of chromatin. Chromatin can be more or less tightly wound, depending on the degree of compaction.\nUniformly compact chromatin is called heterochromatin. Heterochromatin can be more difficult to transcribe.\nLoosely compact chromatin is called euchromatin. Euchromatin is easier to transcribe.\nThe degree of chromatin compaction can be affected by chemical modifications to the histones and by the presence of other proteins. For example, addition of an acetyl group to an histone is associated with a decrease in compaction. On the other hand, methylation of an histone is associated with an increase in compaction.\nSOLUTION: Increased histone deacetyltransferase activity will usually lead to a decrease in gene expression. Histone deacetyltransferase can remove acetyl groups from histones. This action can lead to an increase in chromatin compaction and a decrease in gene expression."}

{"question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nAccording to the article, which of the following is NOT a benefit of sauna use?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decreased risk of heart attacks."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increase in stroke volume."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Improved mental health."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decreased rate of erectile dysfunction."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The human body has several mechanisms for responding to stress, including the release of hormones and the activation of the autonomic nervous system.\nWhen the body is exposed to a stressor, such as exercise or a fight-or-flight situation, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated. The hypothalamus produces a hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH is released by the hypothalamus and stimulates the pituitary gland to produce corticotropin, a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol. Cortisol is a steroid hormone that has many effects, including increasing blood sugar levels and suppressing the immune system.\nWhen a stressor is introduced to the body, the HPA axis produces a surge of cortisol. This surge tells the body to produce more corticotropin and cortisol to help deal with the stressor.\nAfter a stressor has been resolved, the HPA axis stops producing cortisol. The production of cortisol decreases, and the body starts to feel calm. This decrease in cortisol helps the body recover from the stressor.\nThe diagram below shows the steps involved in the HPA axis.\nThe hypothalamus produces CRH.\nCRH stimulates the pituitary gland to produce corticotropin.\nCorticotropin stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol.\nCortisol has various effects on the body.\nThe pituitary gland produces prolactin.\nProlactin has various effects on the body.\nThe hypothalamus produces thyrotropin.\nThyrotropin stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone.\nThyroid hormone has various effects on the body."}

These substances are broken down further to produce ADP, or adenosine diphosphate, and FAD, or flavin adenine dinucleotide. Cells use the energy from ADP and FAD to power various cellular activities, including biosynthesis, transport, and cell movement.\nIn the process of breaking down ADP and FAD, water is produced, and the cell becomes charged with positive electric charges. These positive charges, or protons, create a difference in electric potential, or voltage, across the cell membrane. This voltage difference, or proton motive force, can be used to drive the production of ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, by a process called chemiosmosis.\nATP is a powerful energy source in cells. It is also a macro molecule that can be broken down to release energy that cells can use to power various activities. The energy release from ATP is called its hydrolysis.\nCells use the energy from ATP to do work, such as moving molecules across a cell membrane. Cells can use the energy from ATP to do work because ATP is a nucleotide. Nucleotides are molecules that are made of nucleotides. Nucleotides are the building blocks of RNA and DNA.\nThe figure below shows how cells can use the energy from ATP to do work.\nIn this figure, the cell membrane is exposed to a positively charged and a negatively charged surface. When ATP is hydrolyzed, or broken down, its phosphate groups are separated from its nucleotide part. This separation of phosphate groups from the nucleotide part of ATP releases energy.\nThe phosphate groups can be separated from the nucleotide part of ATP by a kinase. A kinase is an enzyme that can transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a different substance. When a phosphate group is transferred to a different substance by a kinase, the nucleotide part of ATP is broken down.\nThe energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP can be used to do work. For example, the energy can be used to move molecules across a cell membrane.\nSOLUTION: To determine how many ATP are produced when FADH2 and NADH+H are broken down, compare the energy carried by the pairs of electrons in FADH2 and NADH+H to the energy used to rephosphorylate.\nRephosphorylation is the process of adding a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. This process requires the addition of energy. The amount of energy used to rephosphorylate is equal to the amount of energy produced by the breakdown of one molecule of glucose. One molecule of glucose has 2,000 kilocalories of energy. This is equal to the amount of energy needed to rephosphorylate 1 molecule of ADP to make 1 molecule of ATP.\nSo, the FADH2 and NADH+H pairs of electrons contain enough free energy to rephosphorylate 2 ATP."}
