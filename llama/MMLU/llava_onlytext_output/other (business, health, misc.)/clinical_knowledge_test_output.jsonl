When it is ingested, it becomes part of the blood. The blood's pH will increase because of the base. However, the blood's pH will also decrease because of the acid. So, the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid are changed. The extracellular fluid is the fluid that surrounds cells.\nThe muscles use energy from the blood to make hydrogen ions. This process, called metabolism, can cause the muscle to become more acidic. The pH of the muscle can affect the muscle's ability to contract.\nWhen the pH of the extracellular fluid is elevated, the rate at which hydrogen ions are removed from the muscle increases. This is called an efflux. The hydrogen ions are moved into the blood. The pH of the muscle increases."}

Thyroid nodules are common, and they may be filled with fluid or with cells. Thyroid nodules can cause a lump or swelling in your neck.\nA thyroid swelling may be caused by a nodule, by enlarged lymph nodes, or by other conditions.\nA functioning nodule is a nodule that is producing thyroid hormone. Most functioning nodules are not cancer. But sometimes, a functioning nodule can be cancer.\nAn ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether a nodule is actively secreting hormone. Ultrasound uses sound waves to make images of the body.\nAn isotope scan is a test that uses a small amount of radioactive material. The radioactive material is taken up by the thyroid gland. Then, a special camera can track the radioactive material to create images of the thyroid gland.\nLymph node enlargement is not a good prognostic sign. A prognostic sign is a sign that can predict what is likely to happen to a person. Lymph node enlargement near a thyroid nodule is not a strong predictor of the type of nodule a person has.\nA thyroid swelling may elevate on swallowing. This is because the thyroid gland lies on top of the windpipe. When you swallow, the thyroid gland moves in front of the windpipe. This can make a lump or swelling in the thyroid gland seem like it is elevated on swallowing."}

The cells in the bones also respond to the parathyroid hormone by releasing calcium into the blood.\nSOLUTION: Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium.\nCalcitonin is a hormone that helps to lower the calcium level in the blood. Calcitonin does this by preventing the cells in the kidneys from reabsorbing calcium.\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic.\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone. This can happen if one or more of the parathyroid glands becomes overactive.\nMost people with primary hyperparathyroidism do not have any symptoms. In fact, most people do not find out that they have primary hyperparathyroidism until they have a routine blood test.\nVitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands.\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is important for the absorption of calcium. But the parathyroid glands do not secrete vitamin D.\nThe parathyroid glands produce the parathyroid hormone. When the blood calcium level is low, the parathyroid glands produce and release the parathyroid hormone. The parathyroid hormone then helps the cells in the kidneys reabsorb calcium from the kidneys into the blood. The cells in the bones also respond to the parathyroid hormone by releasing calcium into the blood.\nOliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\nHypercalcaemia is a condition in which there is too much calcium in the blood. Oliguria is a condition in which there is very little urine.\nSo, oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia, not of primary hyperparathyroidism."}

They help control the amount of energy a cell has. If a cell has too much energy, it can become harmful.\nHow do mitochondria get energy from food?\nWhen a cell eats food and breaks it down, the food breaks down into a type of energy that cells can use. Mitochondria pull this energy out of the food and store it in a form that cells can use.\nHow do mitochondria control the amount of energy a cell has?\nCells use a type of energy called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for many different things. When a cell has enough ATP, it can do the things it needs to do. If a cell does not have enough ATP, it can become sick.\nMitochondria help control the amount of ATP a cell has by using the food they get from eating. If a cell has a lot of food, it will have a lot of ATP. If a cell does not have enough food, it will have less ATP.\nSOLUTION: Mitochondria are found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.\nThe enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) are found in the mitochondrial inner membrane.

This energy is released when phosphates are broken apart during contraction.\nWhen muscles work hard, they use more energy. So, the level of inorganic phosphate in the muscles can decrease.\nOne way that muscles can get more energy is by breaking apart adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When ATP is broken apart, a phosphate is released. This phosphate can be used to break apart more ATP.\nThe diagram below shows how ATP is broken apart to produce energy.\nThe enzyme ATP synthase is involved in breaking apart ATP. ATP synthase uses the energy from this process to combine adenosine diphosphate (ADP) with a phosphate. The result is ATP.\nThis process can use up a phosphate. So, the level of ATP in the muscles can also decrease.\nSOLUTION: Peripheral muscle fatigue occurs when the muscles stop working as well. This can be caused by an accumulation of inorganic phosphate. An excess of antioxidants can also contribute to peripheral muscle fatigue. Antioxidants can interfere with the body's ability to produce energy.\nA lack of potassium is another factor that can contribute to peripheral muscle fatigue. Potassium helps muscles contract.\nAn accumulation of inorganic phosphate, an excess of antioxidants, and a lack of potassium are all thought to be implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities."}

Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to trigger the thyroid gland. Tertiary hypothyroidism occurs when there is a problem with the thyroid hormone that is produced.\nSOLUTION: A raised TSH level is a sign of hypothyroidism. The pituitary gland produces TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone. When the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone, the pituitary gland will produce more TSH to try to get the thyroid gland to produce more hormone. So, a raised TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone."}

An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait, such as flower color, is its observable combination of alleles and environmental factors. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of alleles and the environment.\nSome traits, such as flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.

It describes the highest level of exercise that a person can do.\nDuring maximal exercise, your body uses energy from stored fat and sugar in your body. After 10 seconds of maximal exercise, your body begins to use more oxygen. This is because the intensity of exercise is still too high for your body to use oxygen efficiently.\nAfter 30 seconds of maximal exercise, your body is still using more oxygen than it did during the first 10 seconds. But it is using less oxygen than it will use during the next 10 to 20 seconds of exercise.\nSo, after 30 seconds of maximal exercise, exercise becomes more aerobic. Your body starts to use more oxygen during exercise. This is because the intensity of exercise is lower.\nAfter 1 minute of maximal exercise, exercise becomes even more aerobic. Your body is using less oxygen than it was at 30 seconds.\nAfter 4 minutes of maximal exercise, exercise becomes predominantly aerobic. This means that your body is using more oxygen than it was at 1 minute of maximal exercise."}

Cells use many different pathways to break down molecules and release energy. These pathways are called metabolic pathways.\nOne important metabolic pathway is beta-oxidation. Cells use beta-oxidation to break down fats, or lipids. Beta-oxidation breaks down fat into acetyl-CoA, which can be used to generate energy.\nThe beta-oxidation of an odd-numbered fatty acid chain starts with a carbon atom with an odd number. The beta-oxidation of an even-numbered fatty acid chain starts with a carbon atom with an even number.\nWhen a carbon atom is degraded during beta-oxidation, it forms two molecules of acetyl-CoA.\nThe first step of beta-oxidation removes an acetyl group from the carbon atom to form a carbon-coenzyme A molecule. The acetyl group is then transferred to a molecule of coenzyme A to form acetyl-coenzyme A.\nThe carbon-coenzyme A molecule is then degraded to produce two molecules of acetyl-CoA.\nThe beta-oxidation pathway also generates heat and water as byproducts.\nSOLUTION: The given molecular formula has an even number of carbon atoms in its chain.

When the concentration of a substance in the blood changes, the concentration of that substance also changes. For example, if a substance is created by the body, its concentration in the blood will increase. If a substance is used up by the body, its concentration in the blood will decrease.\nThe body uses a process called degradation to break down substances. Degradation creates new substances that are then excreted from the body. When these new substances are created, their concentration in the blood increases.\nSome substances are created by the breakdown of nutrients. Nutrients are types of substances that the body uses for energy. When the body breaks down nutrients, by-products are created. These by-products are called degradation products.\nThe degradation products of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can be used by the body for energy. But if too many degradation products are created, they can build up in the blood and cause damage.\nSOLUTION: The breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a major source of energy for the body. When ATP is broken down, a substance called adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is created. The concentration of ADP in the blood increases when the body breaks down ATP.\nThere are three types of ADP degradation products. These are ammonia, urea, and creatinine.\nAmmonia and urea can be changed by the body into substances that are used for energy. But when the concentration of these substances in the blood increases, they can cause problems.\nAmmonia and urea can irritate the lining of the stomach and intestines. This can cause nausea and vomiting.\nCreatinine is a waste product that is created when creatine, a substance that helps supply energy to muscles, is used up. The concentration of creatinine in the blood increases when muscles use up their store of creatine.\nMultiple sprint sports require short, intense periods of exercise. These sports cause the body to break down ATP quickly. The breakdown of ATP creates a large amount of ADP. This leads to an increase in the concentration of ADP degradation products, including ammonia, urea, and creatinine, in the blood."}

The food provides the energy, or power, that allows the body to do work.\nWhen you eat food, your body breaks it down into glucose, or sugar. Glucose is converted into a type of energy called ATP, or adenosine triphosphate. ATP is the fuel that poweres the body.\nThe body has three main ways to use ATP:\n1. Muscles can use ATP to contract. This contraction is what makes the body move.\n2. The brain can use ATP to send signals. This signaling is what makes the body do its things.\n3. The body can use ATP to keep warm. This is because the body produces heat when ATP is used.\nThe maximum sustainable power of the body is a measure of how much work the body can do. The maximum sustainable power depends on things like muscle glycogen content and fat composition.\nMuscle glycogen content is a measure of how much glucose is stored in the muscles. The body can use this stored glucose for energy.\nAn athlete's fat composition is a measure of how much body fat the athlete has. An athlete's maximum sustainable power is lower when the athlete's body fat is higher.\nSOLUTION: The maximum sustainable power of the body is inversely related to muscle glycogen content. This means that as the muscle glycogen content decreases, the maximum sustainable power decreases.\nDuring a race, the muscle glycogen content decreases. So, the maximum sustainable power of the body decreases with the distance of the race."}

This physical movement triggers muscle cells to refill with calcium, which is necessary for muscle contraction.\nSome athletes take calcium supplements to improve their performance. But studies have not shown a clear benefit from calcium supplements.\nCreatine supplements are another story. Creatine is an organic acid that occurs naturally in your body. Your body uses creatine to help produce phosphocreatine, which is a high-energy compound in your muscles. When you exercise, phosphocreatine breaks down and donates a phosphate group to ADP, which converts it to ATP. ATP is the primary source of energy for your muscles.\nCreatine supplements increase the amount of creatine in your muscles. This increase helps raise your body's store of phosphocreatine. More phosphocreatine is converted to ATP, which can help improve your performance during intense exercise.\nAmino acid supplements are another story. Amino acids are the building blocks of muscle protein. Your body uses amino acids to produce muscle protein.\nMuscle damage is induced by shortening contractions.

Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn the cell, the molecule ATP (adenosine triphosphate) provides a source of energy that the body can use. The body uses ATP to perform many functions, such as moving muscles.\nATP is made up of three parts: adenosine, triphosphate, and a molecule called a phosphate group. The phosphate group has three atoms: a positively charged atom called a phosphorus atom and two atoms of the element sulfur.\nWhen the phosphate group in ATP is broken, the phosphorus atom and one of the sulfur atoms are released. This releases energy that can be used by the body.\nThere are several ways that the body can break the phosphate group in ATP. One way is through glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose. Glucose is a type of sugar that is broken down by glycolysis.\nAnother way is through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is also called the Krebs' cycle. This cycle breaks down a type of acid called citrate.\nDuring exercise, the body needs more energy to keep functioning. The body can get more energy by breaking down more molecules of ATP. The most rapid way to resynthesize ATP during exercise is through phosphocreatine breakdown. Phosphocreatine is a molecule that helps to store energy in the body. When the body needs more energy, it breaks down phosphocreatine and quickly resynthesizes ATP.\nThe body also can get energy by breaking down glycogen, which is a type of sugar that is stored in the muscles and liver. This process is called glycogenolysis.\nSOLUTION: The most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during exercise is through phosphocreatine breakdown. This process can produce ATP quickly because it does not require oxygen."}

This energy is in the form of a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). When the body uses ATP, it breaks the bonds between the phosphate groups. These phosphate groups have energy that the body can use to fuel its processes.\nThe body uses oxygen to break down ATP. This process of breaking bonds between phosphate groups and using the energy to fuel body processes is called cellular respiration.\nWhen an athlete is at rest, their body uses ATP for basic functions such as keeping their heart beating and keeping their body temperature constant.\nDuring exercise, the body needs more ATP to keep up with the demand for energy. The body gets this extra ATP by breaking down both glucose and fat.\nThe breakdown of glucose and fat uses oxygen. The body combines the oxygen with glucose or fat to form a molecule called acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA can then be used to break down ATP.\nThe rate at which an athlete uses ATP and oxygen is called their steady-state oxygen uptake, or SSO2. An athlete's SSO2 can be used to determine how much energy they are using.\nSOLUTION: To determine how much energy an athlete is using, look at their SSO2. An athlete's SSO2 is given in liters per minute.\nThe athlete's SSO2 is 3.0 liters/minute.\nThis means that the athlete is using 3.0 liters of oxygen per minute.\nThe athlete is using oxygen to break down ATP. So, the athlete is using 3.0 liters of oxygen to break down ATP.\nThis means that the athlete is using 3.0 liters of oxygen to form acetyl CoA. The acetyl CoA can then be used to break down 1 molecule of ATP.\nSo, the athlete is using 3.0 liters of oxygen to form 1 molecule of acetyl CoA. This means that the athlete is using 3.0 liters of oxygen to break down 1 molecule of ATP.\nThere are 2 phosphate groups in 1 molecule of ATP. So, the athlete is using 3.0 liters of oxygen to break down 2 phosphate groups.\nThe bond between each phosphate group has 3 units of energy. So, the bond between 2 phosphate groups has 3 x 3 = 6 units of energy.\nThe athlete is using 6 units of energy to form 1 molecule of acetyl CoA. This means that 1 molecule of ATP has 6 units of energy."}

When fluid leaks out of blood vessels and collects in body tissues, it can cause edema.\nEdema results from an imbalance in the pressure of fluid within the vessels and in the tissues. When the pressure in the vessels increases, fluid seeps out and accumulates in the tissues. When the pressure in the tissues increases, fluid leaks out of the vessels and into the tissues.\nThe types of edema are described based on the location of the excess fluid.\nIntravascular edema occurs when there is excessive fluid in the blood vessels. This type of edema can cause congestion in the lungs, leading to trouble breathing.\nInterstitial edema occurs when there is excessive fluid in the tissues. This type of edema can cause swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet.\nTransudative edema is caused by a protein in the tissues that has leaked out into the fluid. This type of edema is not as common as the other types.\nExudative edema is caused by inflammation in the body. This type of edema can occur with an infection or an injury.\nSOLUTION: Excessive intravascular fluid is the presence of oedema. The heart pumps blood into the blood vessels. The blood vessels have pressure, or force, on their inner walls. This pressure helps to keep the blood in the blood vessels.\nIf the pressure in the blood vessels decreases, the blood can begin to seep out of the vessels. This is called edema.\nIntravascular edema occurs when there is excessive fluid in the blood vessels. This type of edema can cause congestion in the lungs, leading to trouble breathing."}

Glucose is transported into cells through a process called facilitated diffusion.\nFacilitated diffusion is a type of transport that does not require an energy-producing molecule called ATP. Instead, facilitated diffusion uses the natural movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.\nCells can use glucose as a fuel source or store glucose for later use. When cells need a fuel source, they can convert glucose into pyruvate. This process is called glycolysis, and it happens in the cytoplasm of the cell.\nIf cells have excess glucose, they can use a process called cellular respiration to break down pyruvate and release energy. This process happens in the mitochondria of the cell."}

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nImagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?\nThe number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.\nTime is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.\nThere are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour.\nSOLUTION: Measuring the blood pressure in an arm that is above the level of the heart will overestimate the blood pressure.\nThe blood pressure gets higher as the arm lowers. So, if the arm is above the level of the heart, the blood pressure will be higher than it actually is."}

Your bloodstream has cells called capillaries that lie close to the surface of the skin and the mucous membranes. Capillaries in the skin and lungs absorb drugs quickly.\nWhen a drug is inhaled, it goes into the lungs and quickly enters the bloodstream. This is how inhaled drugs are delivered to the body.\nInhaled medications have several advantages. They go directly to the lungs, where they can act quickly. They also go directly into the bloodstream, which allows them to enter the body quickly. This can be important when a drug needs to be given quickly.\nInhaled medications can also be used to bypass the gastrointestinal tract. This can be useful when a drug cannot be taken by mouth because it is broken down by stomach acid or because the patient is unable to swallow."}

The food is broken down into smaller components during digestion. The body uses two main ways to get energy from these smaller components: aerobic energy production and anaerobic energy production.\nAerobic energy production involves using oxygen from the air to break down sugar into energy. This type of energy production is used for activities that are low to moderate in intensity.\nAnaerobic energy production does not use oxygen from the air. Instead, it uses the energy from the breakdown of sugar. Anaerobic energy production is more efficient than aerobic energy production, but it produces more waste products, such as lactic acid. Anaerobic energy production is used for activities that are high in intensity and short in duration.\nSOLUTION: The TCA cycle (Krebs' cycle) and the electron transfer chain are both involved in aerobic energy production. The TCA cycle uses oxygen from the air to break down sugar into energy. The electron transfer chain is part of the TCA cycle and helps to produce ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, which is the energy currency of the cell.\nAerobic energy production is a higher intensity exercise than anaerobic energy production. The TCA cycle and the electron transfer chain make more ATP when oxygen is present."}
