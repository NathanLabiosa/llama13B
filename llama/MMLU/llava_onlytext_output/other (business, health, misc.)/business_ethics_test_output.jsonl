Some limitations and risks of these collaborations include:\nPower imbalances: Large corporations have greater resources and influence than many CSOs. This can lead to unequal bargaining power and can cause CSOs to accept less favorable agreements.\nInformational asymmetries: The differing amounts and types of information that parties have can also pose problems. For example, CSOs may not have access to the same information that a corporation does about the social and environmental impact of a product or service.\nBenefits: CSOs may be co-opted by corporations to provide legitimacy to the corporation's social and environmental policies.

The process of communication is comprised of six elements, or parts, which must be present in any communication: a sender, information to be communicated, a communication channel, a receiver, a decision to communicate, and an audience.\nAny time information is sent from one person to another, there is an opportunity for communication to occur. The process of communication is a transmitter of information, and the process of communication is a receiver of information.\nThere are many ways to communicate, and different ways may be more appropriate for different situations. Some ways of communicating are more direct and forceful, while other ways are more indirect and diplomatic. Some ways of communicating use symbols, such as words, to convey information, while other ways of communicating use images, such as paintings, to convey information.\nThe height of transmission refers to the number of people who must carry the information from the sender to the receiver. The breadth of transmission refers to the number of people who receive the information. The avenue of approach refers to the mode of communication, or the way the information is communicated. The content of the communication is the information itself.\nSOLUTION: Each part of the communication process is shown in the diagram below.\nThe government has information to transmit to consumers. It decides to do so through a television commercial. The television commercial is the avenue of approach. The information is transmitted over a wide area, so the breadth of transmission is wide. The content of the commercial is the information the government wants consumers to know."}

These three parts form a supply loop.\nA firm's supply loops can have a big impact on its environmental impact. The materials and energy used in a supply loop produce the firm's output and waste.\nWhen a firm redesigns its supply loops, it can improve its environmental performance. For example, a firm can reduce the amount of waste it produces by using fewer raw materials and by using recycled materials.

A program is a set of these instructions.\nSome instructions are used to make decisions. Decisions can be made using a branch.\nIf you want to decide between two options, you can use an if-else clause. The if-else clause has three parts: a condition, one or more instructions to execute if the condition is true, and one or more instructions to execute if the condition is false.\nFor example, consider a program that checks if a number is odd or even. It does this by checking if the number is divisible by 2.\nIf the number is odd, the program prints \"The number is odd.\".\nElse, the program prints \"The number is even.\"."}

Ethics does not need to be written down, and different people and groups can have different ethical principles.\nLaw is a set of rules that are enforced by a government. Law can include both civil and criminal rules.\nCivil rules tell you what you can and cannot do. Some civil rules are based on ethical principles, but most are not. For example, civil rules might say that you can be sued if you damage someone else's property, even if it is not considered wrong by most people.\nCriminal rules tell you what is illegal and what is not. Every country has criminal laws that say what is illegal. Many criminal laws are based on ethical principles, but not all of them. For example, many countries have criminal laws that make it illegal to harm other people, but not all countries have these laws.\nSOLUTION: The relationship between ethics and the law is not as close as some ethical systems have claimed. For example, many people believe that ethics is a broader system that includes questions that the law does not address.\nThe law does not need to concern itself with questions of earthly justice. It is not unethical to pollute the environment, but it is illegal.\nSome areas do have considerable overlap between ethics and the law. Many ethical and legal rules relating to issues such as libel, slander, and invasion of privacy are similar.\nIn general, the law does not concern itself with questions of motive. Ethics, on the other hand, is concerned with motives."}
