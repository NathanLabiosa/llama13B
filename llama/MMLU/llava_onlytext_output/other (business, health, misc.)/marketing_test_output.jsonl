For example, a laundry service may be delivered at the customer's home or at a central facility. The level of tangibility associated with the type of product also can vary. For example, a software product may exist entirely as a series of instructions on a tangible medium, or it may have both tangible and intangible parts.\nPerformance-value and variations in supply and demand are factors that can affect the extent to which a service envelops a product. For example, the demand for toll-free phone numbers can affect whether a service envelops a product. The level of performance-value can also affect this. For example, a service that offers 24-hour phone support is providing a higher level of performance-value than a service that offers support only during business hours.\nSOLUTION: The way in which the service is delivered is not a factor that affects the extent to which a service envelops a product. The service may be delivered in-person, at a distance, or through a hybrid of the two. The type of product being offered, however, determines whether the service envelops the product. A service that is delivered at a distance can envelop a product. A service that is delivered in-person can also envelop a product. But a service that is delivered in-person cannot envelop a service that is delivered at a distance."}

It is a type of learning in which a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, eventually coming to trigger the same response.\nFor example, the ringing of a telephone may eventually cause you to salivate. This reaction was first caused by the meaningful stimulus of food. But after many repeated rings of the telephone, the telephone ringing becomes associated with food and triggers the same response. In this way, the neutral stimulus of the telephone ringing becomes conditioned to the meaningful stimulus of food.\nOperant conditioning is a form of learning in which behavior is shaped by its consequences. Behaviors that are followed by a desirable consequence are likely to be repeated. Behaviors that are followed by an undesirable consequence are likely to be extinguished.\nFor example, a child is likely to make a face after tasting a new food. The child's behavior is followed by an undesirable consequence (a bad taste). So, the child is likely to stop making the face.\nSocial learning is a type of learning in which people observe the behavior of others. People learn a lot about how to behave by watching others.\nFor example, a person may learn to dance by watching others dance.\nBehavioural learning is a type of learning in which an association is made between a behavior and its consequence. This type of learning is not specific to any one situation.\nFor example, a person may learn that singing in the shower is fun. The person is likely to sing in the shower again in the future.\nSOLUTION: Providing free samples of perfumes (scent) in magazines is an example of classical conditioning. The scent of the perfume is a neutral stimulus. It becomes associated with the magazine. Later, when you smell the perfume, you are more likely to think of the magazine."}

For example, it is difficult to sell a haircut service through the internet, because a haircut is a service that is produced and consumed at the same time.\nVariability: A service is customized. This means that each service is different. There are many different ways to produce a service. Each way is a variation.\nThe variability of a service affects the production and marketing of the service. Because a service is variabel, the producer must decide how to customize the service. The producer must also decide how to market the customized service to potential buyers.\nPerishability: A service is temporary. This means that a service is available for use for a limited time.\nThe perishability of a service affects the sale of the service. Because a service is temporary, it must be sold before it is used. This is different from a product, which can be sold after it is used. The perishability of a service also affects the production of the service. Because a service is temporary, it must be produced and consumed simultaneously."}

{"question": " What is the term used to describe how consistent or stable the ratings generated by a scale are?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Replication."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pre-code."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Reliability."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Convenience."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nImagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?\nThe number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.\nNow look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.\nThere are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.\nThere are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.\nSOLUTION: The term reliability describes how consistent or stable the ratings generated by a scale are.\nA reliable scale will have consistent ratings. For example, a scale that measures weight must have consistent ratings.\nIf one side of a scale weighs 100 grams when loaded with 100 grams, it should also weigh 100 grams when loaded with 50 grams.\nA stable scale will have ratings that do not change for no reason. For example, a scale that measures weight should not show a 5-pound weight as 5.5 pounds just because it is windy outside."}

When one variable causes a change in the other variable, they are said to be causally related.\nIn a study, you can use different types of variables to determine causation.\nAn experimental study directly compares a group that is exposed to a treatment with a group that is not. This is the most strong way to determine causation.\nA longitudinal study follows a group of people over time. It compares a group that is exposed to a treatment with a group that is not. Longitudinal studies can show whether having the treatment is associated with a higher risk of a certain effect.\nA correlational study examines how two variables change together. A correlation does not show causation. But it can help to identify variables that may be causally related.\nA causal research study is a study in which the researcher has controlled for all of the confounding variables. Confounding variables are variables that are not of interest, but that may be affecting the relationship between the variables in the study. When confounding variables are controlled for, the study is said to be causal.\nSOLUTION: Ethnographic study, focus groups, and consumer juries are not experimental or longitudinal studies. They are not designed to determine causation.\nAn ethnographic study is a study that observes a group of people in their natural environment.\nFocus groups are small groups that discuss a topic.\nConsumer juries are groups of people who judge products."}

This process is called market segmentation.\nSegmenting customers can help marketers create more effective marketing strategies. Customers who share traits or characteristics may have similar needs and wants.\nOne of the traits marketers use to segment customers is ethnicity. Being part of an ethnic group does not necessarily mean that customers have the same needs and wants. But being part of an ethnic group does mean that customers may have cultural ties and commonalities.\nMarketers can use these traits to adapt their marketing strategies to better serve different segments of customers. This process is called targeting.\nSOLUTION: One of the typical results of recognizing the importance of ethnic groups is adaptation of the advertising, particularly the use of foreign languages, to the target ethnic market.\nMarketers often use advertising to communicate with customers. Customers who speak different languages or who have different cultural backgrounds may respond better to advertising that is tailored to their backgrounds.\nUse of an undifferentiated one-size-fits-all marketing strategy is typically not a result of recognizing the importance of ethnic groups by marketers. A one-size-fits-all marketing strategy is a generic strategy that is not tailored to the needs of any particular group.\nVariations in product offerings to suit the wants of a particular group are a result of recognizing the importance of ethnic groups by marketers. If marketers understand the wants of a particular ethnic group, they can create products that meet those wants.\nStudy of ethnic buying habits to isolate market segments is a result of recognizing the importance of ethnic groups by marketers.
