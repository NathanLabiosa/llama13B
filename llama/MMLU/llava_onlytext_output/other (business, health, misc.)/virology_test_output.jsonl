The discovery of the link between a virus and a disease is a careful, step-by-step process.\nThe first step in discovering that a virus causes a disease is to find a link between the virus and the disease. This can be done in one of two ways:\n1. Find the virus in every case of the disease: If a virus is found in every case of a disease, it is strongly suggested that the virus causes the disease.\n1. Find the disease in every case of the virus: If a disease is found in every case of a virus infection, it is strongly suggested that the virus causes the disease.\nThe second step is to rule out all other possible causes for the disease. This can be done by running many experiments. For example, if a virus is suspected of causing a disease, experiments can be done to prove the virus is found in every case of the disease. Or, experiments can be done to prove that the disease is always found in every case of the virus infection.\nIf no other possible causes for a disease can be found, then the virus is likely the cause of the disease.\nSOLUTION: In 1911, a scientist named Peyton Rous noticed that chickens could be made to develop a very aggressive form of cancer by injecting them with a chicken virus. Rous then discovered the virus, which he named Rous sarcoma. This was the first retrovirus to be discovered."}

These cells are called B cells. B cells can produce antibodies against a wide variety of substances, including bacteria and viruses.\nWhen a B cell interacts with a foreign substance, called an antigen, it can become activated. Interaction with an antigen tells the B cell that the substance is not native to the body.\nAfter a B cell is activated, it begins to produce antibodies against the antigen. There are several types of antibodies, or isotypes. Two of these isotypes are called IgG, IgA, and IgM. These isotypes can be produced by B cells at different times during the immune response.\nIgM is the first antibody isotype produced by B cells in response to an antigen. IgM antibodies can cause the antigen to be removed from the body.\nIgG antibodies are produced later in the immune response. IgG antibodies can help remove the antigen from the body, and they can also help activate other parts of the immune system.\nIgA antibodies are found in mucous membranes, such as in the digestive tract and respiratory system. IgA antibodies can help protect against infections in these areas.\nHow are antibody-producing cells stimulated?\nInteracting with a virus-infected cell is not the correct answer. When a B cell interacts with a virus-infected cell, it becomes activated and begins to produce antibodies against the virus. But this is not how the B cell is stimulated to produce antibodies.\nInteracting with a T helper cell is not the correct answer. T cells, or helper cells, are not involved in stimulating B cells to produce antibodies.\nInteracting with a virus short peptide is not the correct answer. A short peptide is a piece of a protein. Interacting with a virus short peptide does not stimulate the activation of a B cell."}

One way is by failing to measure or control for confounding variables. A confounding variable is one that is associated with both the exposure and the outcome. For example, age is a confounding variable in a study that investigates the maximum allowed weight on a road bridge. People of all ages are allowed to cross the bridge, but older people are less likely to drive and are less likely to exceed the maximum weight limit. The age variable is associated with the exposure (driving) and the outcome (maximum weight).\nA study that has a confounding variable will usually have a biased estimate of the exposure's effect on the outcome. This is because the confounding variable has the effect of making the association between the exposure and the outcome differ from the true association. For example, the estimate of the maximum weight's effect on the risk of traffic accidents will be higher in people who are older than in people who are younger. But older people have a higher risk of traffic accidents for reasons unrelated to the maximum weight, so the true association is that people who are older have a higher risk of traffic accidents.\nAn interaction is a confounding variable that differs across the range of the exposure. For example, age is an interaction in a study that investigates the maximum allowed weight on a road bridge. People who are older than 65 are not allowed to drive across the bridge. The interaction between age and the maximum weight is different for people younger than 65 than for people older than 65.\nA study that has an interaction will usually have a biased estimate of the exposure's effect on the outcome. This is because the interaction has the effect of making the association between the exposure and the outcome differ from the true association. For example, the estimate of the maximum weight's effect on the risk of traffic accidents will be different for people younger than 65 than for people older than 65. But the true association is that people who are older have a higher risk of traffic accidents.\nStratification is the process of dividing a population into groups based on the exposure or outcome. A study that is stratified on the exposure is trying to eliminate, or at least reduce, the effect of confounding variables.\nA study that is stratified on the exposure will not have a perfect estimate of the exposure's effect on the outcome. This is because the groups that are formed based on the exposure may differ in ways that are not related to the exposure. For example, people in different age groups may have different rates of traffic accidents, but the age groups were not different in terms of the maximum weight. But a study that is stratified on the exposure will have a more accurate estimate of the exposure's effect on the outcome than a study that is not stratified on the exposure.\nSOLUTION: A study has a systematic error that results in a mistaken estimate of an exposure\u2019s effect on the risk of disease is called confounding.\nThis means that the study has a confounding variable. A confounding variable is one that is associated with both the exposure and the outcome."}

RNA viruses and DNA viruses can evolve in different ways.\nRNA viruses can evolve by mutation. A mutation is a change in the DNA or RNA genome. Some mutations are caused by errors in the genetic material when it is replicated. Other mutations are caused by the environment.\nMost RNA viruses have an RNA genome that is not as stable as a DNA genome. As an RNA virus replicates, or makes new viruses, its genome can change. These changes can make the virus more or less virulent.\nSome RNA viruses can also evolve by recombination. Recombination occurs when two viruses infect a cell at the same time. Their genetic material can mix, or recombine, forming a new virus with genes from both parents.\nDNA viruses can evolve by mutation or recombination.\nA DNA virus's genome is more stable than an RNA genome. As a DNA virus replicates, its genome is not as likely to change.\nHowever, a DNA virus can still change its genome by mistake. These mistakes can create new genetic variants, or subpopulations, of the virus.\nSome DNA viruses can also evolve by recombination.\nSOLUTION: Poliovirus can most easily become more virulent by mutation of the RNA genome at only a few positions.\nThe other three processes listed would not involve the genome of poliovirus changing in the way it becomes more virulent:\nRecombining with another enterovirus would not change the genome of poliovirus.\nAltering its protein coat would not affect the poliovirus genome.\nMultiple nucleotide deletions and substitutions would affect the poliovirus genome, but not as many positions as would be needed to make the virus more virulent."}

This means that they use their RNA to create a new positive RNA strand. The RNA strand is copied, or transcribed, to create a negative RNA strand. The negative RNA strand is then used to create a positive RNA strand. The positive RNA strand leaves the cell to attach to other cells.\nViruses of the picornavirus family replicate as negative strand RNA viruses. This means that they use their RNA to create a new negative RNA strand. The negative RNA strand is then used to create new RNA strands and new viruses.\nRetroviruses replicate as positive strand RNA viruses. However, they also have an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. This enzyme creates a new copy of the RNA strand as a DNA strand. The DNA strand can then enter the cell's nucleus to be replicated. The new RNA strands leave the cell to attach to other cells."}

{"question": "Why do vigorous CD8 cell responses in chronically infected HIV-positive individuals fail to eliminate the virus?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "CTL exhaustion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Epitope escape"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Suboptimal CTL"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Absence of dendritic cells"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Immune cells, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), are important in fighting viral infections. These immune cells can recognize specific parts of a virus. If a CTL can recognize an antigen on a virus, it can kill cells that are infected with that virus.\nChronic viral infections are long-term infections. Some viruses can establish a chronic infection because the immune system cannot eliminate the virus. HIV is a virus that can establish a chronic infection.\nSOLUTION: HIV can escape from CTL by changing the specific antigens on its surface. This process is called epitope escape. HIV has many different epitopes, or parts of the virus that can be recognized by CTL. When CTL try to recognize and kill a virus with a new epitope, the CTL will not be able to find the virus. This is because the CTL are looking for a particular epitope on the virus. When a virus changes its epitope, the CTL cannot find the virus and the infection continues.\nCTL exhaustion means that there are not enough CTL to fight the virus. This can happen when a virus has many different epitopes. In this case, CTL will eventually be exhausted because they will use up their resources trying to fight the virus.\nSuboptimal CTL means that the CTL are not good enough to fight the virus. This can happen if the CTL do not recognize the epitopes on the virus very well."}
