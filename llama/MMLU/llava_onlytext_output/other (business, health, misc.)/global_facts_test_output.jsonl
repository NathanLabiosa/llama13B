A homogeneous society is one in which everyone is from the same \"ethnic\" or \"racial\" group. For example, Japan is a homogeneous society; Japan is made up mainly of Japanese citizens.\nAs societies have become more diverse, researchers have explored how this diversity affects people's views of their communities. Some people believe that diversity can bring new ideas and cultures to a community. Others believe that diversity can lead to cultural conflicts and make it harder for community members to work together.\nSOLUTION: The chart shows the percentage of people in different countries who say that having an increasing number of people of many different races, ethnic groups, and nationalities in their country makes it a better place to live.\nAs of 2018, the chart shows that 53% of Indians say that diversity makes their country a better place to live."}

This approach is known as redistribution-with-growth.\nSOLUTION: The government's minimum wage legislation is an element of the redistribution-with-growth policy approach. When the government requires employers to pay a higher minimum wage, it redistributes income to low-wage workers. This can increase the demand for goods and services, which can stimulate employers to increase their investment in capital and labor.\nLand reform is an element of the redistribution-with-growth policy approach. When the government redistributes land from wealthy landlords to poor farmers, it can increase the amount of land in the hands of low-income families. This can increase investment in land, which can lead to higher agricultural productivity.\nProgressive taxation is an element of the redistribution-with-growth policy approach. A progressive tax is a tax that takes a higher percentage of income from people who make more money. This can redistribute income from high-income people to low-income people. This redistribution can stimulate demand for goods and services, which can increase investment and growth.\nIncreased access to education is an element of the redistribution-with-growth policy approach. Education can increase an individual's productivity, which can raise income. It can also increase an individual's skill, which can enhance the productivity of firms."}

If one of these organizations is corrupt, it can affect the delivery of services. For example, in a corrupt education system, teachers may take bribes in exchange for good grades, or schools may use fraudulent test scores to get more funding.\nBribery can also undermine the rule of law and create a culture of impunity. In a country with widespread bribery, people may feel that breaking the law is acceptable, and public officials may believe that they are above the law. This can make it difficult for a country to develop effectively and can lead to a sense of hopelessness and frustration among citizens.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.

Or they may have had leaders who were corrupt or who did not prioritize the needs of their people.\nIn the past, many African countries have relied on the export of primary products, such as agricultural goods and minerals. But dependence on primary products can lead to poverty. This is because the value of these products is determined by world market prices, which can be quite volatile. For example, the price of agricultural goods like coffee or cocoa can fluctuate greatly. And Africa's mineral-rich countries are subject to the \"resource curse,\" in which the abundance of riches actually leads to underdevelopment."}
