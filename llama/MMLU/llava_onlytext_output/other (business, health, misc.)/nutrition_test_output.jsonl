This is because the bolder people are, the more likely they are to have the disease. For example, the prevalence of diabetes increases when people survive the disease longer.\nIf the population in which the disease is measured increases: The prevalence of a disease increases when the number of people in the population increases. This is because the number of people with the disease also increases. For example, the prevalence of a disease among adults increases when the number of adults in the population increases.\nIf the incidence rate of the disease falls: The prevalence of a disease decreases when the incidence rate of the disease falls. This is because the number of new cases of the disease decreases. For example, the prevalence of a disease decreases when the incidence rate of the disease falls.\nIf recovery of the disease is faster: The prevalence of a disease does not increase when recovery from the disease is faster. This is because the number of people with the disease does not increase."}

A BMD measurement is a test that uses low-dose X-rays to measure how much bone you have. The test can show if you have osteoporosis, if you are at risk for osteoporosis, or if your bone density is normal.\nBone density is a measure of how dense your bones are. A high bone density means that your bones are thick and strong. A low bone density means that your bones are thin and weak. Bone density is usually measured as a ratio compared to the bone density of a young adult.\nBone density can drop as you get older. For women, bone density also drops after menopause. A person with bone density lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls is considered to have osteoporosis. A person with bone density between 2.5 and 1.0 standard deviations below the average is considered to have osteopenia. A person with a bone density within 1.0 standard deviation below the average is considered to have normal bone density.\nSOLUTION: This diagnosis is based on a BMD measurement. A woman over age 80 with osteopenia has a bone density that is lower than the average for her age group, but higher than the bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below the average. So, fewer than 50% of women over age 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis."}

{"question": "Why are some specific indices of iron status (such as serum ferritin or transferrin receptors) generally considered to be more reliable indices of iron status, than blood haemoglobin levels are?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because they respond more rapidly to changes in iron levels in the diet."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because the specific iron indices can be measured more accurately and easily."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because haemoglobin levels vary with subject age, and between the sexes."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Measuring iron status is important because iron is an essential nutrient, and insufficient iron can cause iron deficiency anemia. Iron is needed for the formation of red blood cells, and a lack of iron can impair this process.\nIron is obtained from the diet, and the body can store it for use as needed. The body uses iron from the diet and from stored iron to make new red blood cells.\nWhen the body needs to make red blood cells, it releases stored iron into the blood. This can make the blood contain a higher than normal level of iron. People can have too much iron in their blood for three reasons:\nThey have a high iron diet.\nThey have a disease that causes their body to break down and release iron from cells.\nThe have a transfusion of blood that contains too much iron.\nToo much iron in the blood can cause iron toxicity. Iron toxicity can damage the heart, liver, and other parts of the body.\nSOLUTION: Serum ferritin and transferrin receptors are generally considered more reliable indices of iron status than blood hemoglobin levels.\nBlood hemoglobin levels can be affected by many factors, including iron deficiency, lead poisoning, and chronic disease. These conditions can cause anemia, or a lower than normal number of red blood cells. When the body has anemia, it will use whatever iron is available to form red blood cells. So, blood hemoglobin levels may not accurately reflect iron status in people with anemia.\nSerum ferritin and transferrin receptors are forms of the protein transferrin. Transferrin binds to iron and helps it travel through the blood.\nSerum ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and is found in the blood. When the body has a lot of iron, the serum ferritin level will be high.\nTransferrin receptors are proteins on the surface of cells. When the body has a lot of transferrin receptors, it means that the body needs more iron.\nBoth of these indices can be affected by the amount of iron in the body. So, they are better indicators of iron status than blood hemoglobin levels."}

Carbon 13 has 6 protons and 7 neutrons.\nBecause carbon 13 has more neutrons than carbon 12, carbon 13 is heavier than carbon 12.\nIsotopes of an element have the same chemical properties. So, carbon 12 and carbon 13 are both chemical carbon.\nSome isotopes are stable. Stable isotopes do not radioactively change into another type of isotope.\nOther isotopes are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes do change into another type of isotope.\nRadioactive isotopes release energy in the form of radiation.

The muscular system is made up of muscles, and the skeletal system is made up of bones.\nMuscles and bones have different structures and serve different functions, but they work together to help you move.\nHow do muscles and bones help you move?\nWhen you want to move, you push or pull on something. This sends a signal to your muscles to contract, or squeeze. When muscles contract, they make your bones move.\nSOLUTION: A reduction in lean body mass does not occur with increasing age.\nLean body mass includes all the body tissues and organs that take up less space than bones. As you age, you may lose muscle mass, but this happens to everyone, and it is not an increased appetite.\nAn increased appetite can occur with increasing age. This is because the thyroid gland may not work as well as it did when you were younger. The thyroid gland helps regulate metabolism, which is how your body uses energy. As you age, your metabolism tends to slow down, and you may need to eat more food to keep your body running efficiently.\nImpaired immune function can occur with increasing age. The immune system is the body's defense against diseases. As you age, your immune system tends to be less effective. This can make it harder for your body to fight off diseases.\nAn increased appetite, impaired immune function, and reduced muscle and bone density are all changes that can occur with increasing age."}

Amino acids are made up of a central carbon atom and a group of atoms that is attached to it. The group of atoms that is attached to the carbon atom is called a side chain.\nThere are 20 types of amino acids. They are labeled A through W. The type of amino acid that makes up a protein is called its type.\nSome amino acids are essential. This means that the body cannot make them. We must get them from the things we eat. Other amino acids are non-essential. This means that the body can make them.\nEnzymes called transaminases use coenzymes called coppers to help them catalyze the reaction. The coenzyme is not an amino acid. It is a small molecule that carries chemical groups.\nIn transamination, an amino acid loses its amine group and gains a carboxyl group. This reaction is not reversible.\nSOLUTION: The correct statement is: Transamination is an irreversible reaction in amino acid catabolism. Amino acids are broken down into smaller molecules during catabolism. These smaller molecules can be used by the body for energy or can be converted into different types of molecules such as glucose.\nDuring transamination, an amino acid loses its amine group and gains a carboxyl group. This reaction is not reversible. So, once an amino acid has been transaminated, it cannot be returned to its original state."}

However, evidence to support this theory is inconclusive.\nThe complexity of the mechanisms regulating the absorption of cholesterol and its export in lipoproteins.\nCholesterol is absorbed from the small intestine into the blood. The amount of cholesterol absorbed is regulated by the liver. The liver adjusts its output of cholesterol and other lipids based on the needs of the body.\nThe complexity of the mechanism controlling the clearance of intestinally derived lipoproteins by the liver.\nThe liver receives about one-third of its blood supply from the portal vein, which carries blood from the intestine. The liver can clear this blood of any lipids that it has absorbed from the intestine. The liver excretes the cleared lipids into the bile. The gallbladder stores the bile until the liver needs it to release cholesterol and other fats into the intestine.\nThe multiple intrahepatic responses to increased cellular cholesterol.\nThe liver has multiple ways to adjust for increased cellular cholesterol. For example, the liver can increase the expression of genes that help it get rid of cholesterol. It can also decrease the expression of genes that produce cholesterol."}

Some proteins are formed from amino acids, and others are formed when large molecules of protein link together.\nProteins are made of amino acids. Amino acids can be linked together in long chains to form proteins.\nSome amino acids are essential. This means that they must be obtained through the diet. Other amino acids are non-essential. This means that they can be made by the body.\nAmino acid scoring is a method used to rate the quality of the protein in a food. This method compares the amino acid pattern of the food protein to the amino acid pattern of the reference protein. The reference protein is usually egg protein for adults and milk protein for children.\nWhen the amino acid pattern of the food protein is equal to or better than the reference protein, the food protein is scored. The higher the score, the better the protein.\nSOLUTION: The amino acid score is calculated by comparing the amino acid pattern of the protein to that of egg protein.\nThis statement is correct.

This process is called digestion.\nThe nutrients in the food you eat are broken down by enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that can acting as catalysts to chemical reactions. Enzymes for digestion are produced by the pancreas and secreted into the small intestine.\nThe pancreas is a gland located behind the stomach. It secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine through a tube called the pancreatic duct. The enzymes mix with food as it moves through the small intestine.\nThe small intestine is a long tube that is bent in many places. The parts of the small intestine are the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.\nThe digestive enzymes break down the nutrients in the food into smaller molecules. The nutrients are then absorbed into the blood through the walls of the small intestine.\nThe blood carries the nutrients to all parts of your body. Your body uses the nutrients for energy and growth.\nSOLUTION: The most likely cause of the student's symptoms is bacterial and yeast overgrowth in the small intestine.\nWhen the balance of bacteria and yeast in the small intestine is disrupted, it can cause an infection.

When you eat more calories than you use, your body stores the excess calories as fat. When you use more calories than you eat, your body uses stored fat for energy.\nThis control system works on a day-to-day basis. That means that your body is always trying to keep your energy balance close to equilibrium. For example, if you eat more calories than you need, your body will use some of the extra calories to perform extra metabolic processes, such as converting food into stored fat. These processes require energy, so you will use some of the extra calories to power these processes. This way, you will be able to balance the extra calories you ate with the energy you expended.\nSOLUTION: To maintain energy balance, you need to eat and drink the right amount of calories to balance the calories you expend. A day-to-day basis means that you are constantly adding and removing calories from your body. You do this by eating and drinking a few calories more than you need, and by expending a few more calories than you eat through activity.\nOn a day-to-day basis, your body can handle some changes in calorie intake and calorie expenditure. For example, you can eat a few more calories on one day and a few fewer calories on another day. But if the balance of calories gets too far off, your body will gain or lose weight."}

The figure below shows how methylation can alter access to DNA and, as a result, influence the type and amount of protein produced by cells.\nMethyl groups can be added to or removed from CpG sites in the DNA molecule. CpG sites are places in the DNA molecule where a cytosine and a guanine base are adjacent to each other. CpG sites that are methylated have a methyl group added to them.\nMethylation can affect gene expression. Methylated CpG sites are often transcribed into a noncoding RNA called microRNA, which can bind to messenger RNA (mRNA) and block its translation into protein. Methylated CpG sites can also interfere with the binding of transcription factors to their target sites near CpG sites. Both of these mechanisms can lead to the silencing of specific genes.\nSome CpG sites in the human genome are often unmethylated. These sites are called CpG islands. CpG islands often contain important regulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers. Because CpG islands are unmethylated, they can be transcribed into noncoding RNA, which can bind to transcription factors and affect gene expression.\nSOLUTION: To determine the stage(s) of pregnancy during which in utero exposure to the Dutch Hunger Winter had the biggest effects on DNA methylation in blood cells from the adult offspring, the researchers looked at the differences in DNA methylation between the offspring and a control group of people who were not exposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter. The control group was born after the end of World War II, when food was not rationed.\nThe figure below shows the average methylation levels of several groups of blood cells. The x-axis shows the methylation level, and the y-axis shows the percentage of cells with that methylation level. The dark blue bar shows the average methylation levels for the offspring of people who were exposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter. The light blue bar shows the average methylation levels for the control group.\nThe researchers found that the differences in methylation levels between the offspring of people who were exposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter and the control group were smallest for the group of cells that was exposed to the highest levels of methylation. This result suggests that the biggest effects of in utero exposure to the Dutch Hunger Winter on DNA methylation in blood cells from the adult offspring occurred during the third trimester of pregnancy."}

These pollutants include carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas, and it is responsible for most of the warming that is occurring.\nSOLUTION: To understand how climate change will affect future food security, you need to know how climate change affects food production.\nClimate change is expected to have negative impacts on food security in many parts of the world. For example, climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts, storms, and floods. These climate changes will affect food security in the following ways:\nMore frequent droughts will decrease water availability for growing crops.\nStorms and floods can wash away topsoil and destroy crops.\nBoth decreased water availability and soil erosion will lower crop yields.\nClimate change is also expected to increase temperature. Higher temperatures can harm crops and reduce the water available for growing crops."}

BMI is a measure of the weight-to-height ratio, and it does not consider the composition of that mass. For example, a person may have a high BMI due to a high amount of muscle, not a high amount of body fat.\nBMI is also not an accurate measure for average people. BMI is a measure that was developed for the general population, and it may not be as accurate for individuals who are not of average weight or height. For example, a person who has a lot of muscle mass may have a high BMI, but they are not necessarily overweight.\nHeight-weight tables are more accurate methods for body fat measurements. These tables, which have been developed by the U.S. Army, use a person's weight and height to estimate the amount of body fat."}

Digestibility can be measured in different ways, but they all involve giving the food to a person and analyzing the results.\nThere are several ways to measure the digestibility of a food. One way is to use a respirometer to measure the amount of carbon dioxide that is produced when the food is broken down in the GI tract. This is called respiratory digestibility.\nAnother way to measure digestibility is to measure the amount of food that is absorbed in the small intestine. This is called absorptive digestibility.\nA food's digestibility can also be measured at a particular part of the GI tract, such as the terminal ileum (the end of the small intestine). This is called local digestibility.\nSOLUTION: The first statement is correct. The digestibility of plant proteins is generally less good compared to animal proteins. Plant proteins are not as easily broken down and absorbed in the GI tract as animal proteins.\nThe second statement is incorrect. The digestibility of meat protein is less good compared with plant proteins.

Your BMR is higher when you are a child and lower when you are an adult. Your BMR is also lower if you are a woman and higher if you are a man.\nBMR is measured in kilocalories per day.\nBMR = 10 \u00d7 weight (in kilograms) + 6.25 \u00d7 height (in centimeters) - 5200\nFor example, if a person's weight is 50 kilograms and height is 150 centimeters, their BMR is 10 \u00d7 50 + 6.25 \u00d7 150 - 5200 = 625 kilocalories per day.\nYour metabolic rate can also be affected by your thyroid gland. The thyroid gland produces hormones that can affect your metabolic rate.\nHypothyroidism is when your thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. With hypothyroidism, your BMR decreases.\nHyperthyroidism is when your thyroid gland produces too many hormones. With hyperthyroidism, your BMR increases.\nHowever, your BMR is not directly affected by weight gain or weight loss. After weight gain, you may have more fat-free mass, which does increase your BMR.

A person can be overweight or obese according to their body weight, but still have a normal body composition. On the other hand, a person can have a normal body weight and an abnormal body composition.\nBody composition is the percentage of body fat. A person's body composition can affect their health. For example, having too much body fat can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\nThere are several ways to estimate body composition. The best way to estimate body composition is with a DXA scan. But a body mass index (BMI) calculation can be done with a formula and a calculator.\nFor adults, a BMI of less than 18.5 is underweight.\nA BMI of 18.5-24.9 is normal weight.\nA BMI of 25.0-29.9 is overweight.\nA BMI of 30.0 or higher is obese.\nA four-compartment model is a computer model that uses a formula to estimate body composition. This method is often used to track changes in body composition over time.\nAn MRI can also estimate body composition. An MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create pictures of your insides. An MRI is not done as often as a DXA scan or a four-compartment model. This is because MRI is much more expensive than those options."}

The PER is calculated by comparing the weight gain of young rats fed different proteins.\nThe rat net protein-utilisation assay, or NPU, is another method of assessing protein quality in terms of how well it supports the growth of young rats. The NPU is calculated by measuring the amount of nitrogen young rats retain after being fed different proteins.\nBoth the PER and NPU can be used to compare the protein quality of different foods.\nAnimal growth assays can underestimate the quality of dietary proteins for human nutrition. Young rats grow at a much higher rate than adults. So, a protein that grows rats well may not be as good for adult humans.\nThe growing rat is a good model for assessing protein quality in human nutrition. Over the past 50 years, the PER assay has been used to compare the protein quality of different foods. More recent studies have shown that the PER assay does not always agree with the NPU assay. But the PER assay is simpler and less expensive to perform."}

The dietary intake of older people is often less varied than that of younger adults. Many older people live on a fixed income and have limited access to affordable, nutritious food. This situation is made worse by the fact that the thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin content of food tends to decrease with age, which can increase the risk of malnutrition.\nMultiple micronutrient deficiencies are widespread in older people in high-income countries.\nThis statement is correct. Older people are at risk for multiple micronutrient deficiencies, which can impair immune function and contribute to chronic diseases.\nOlder people generally have a lower energy intake than younger adults.\nThis statement is correct. Older people often have a lower daily intake of energy than younger adults.\nReports suggest that older people consume less than the recommended contribution of fat to energy intake.\nThis statement is incorrect.

It is a small lipoprotein that carries cholesterol from the periphery to the liver for excretion.\nLDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is the main cholesterol-carrying particle in the blood. LDL delivers cholesterol to the periphery, where it can be taken up by cells.\nVLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. It is assembled in the liver and carries triglycerides to the periphery.\nSOLUTION: To decide whether cholesterol and fatty acids are packaged into chylomicrons or VLDL, look at where these lipoproteins are secreted.\nChylomicrons are secreted into the lymph. So, cholesterol and fatty acids absorbed from the intestinal lumen are packaged into chylomicrons and secreted from the enterocytes into the lymph.\nVLDL is secreted into the blood. So, VLDL is assembled in the liver and carries triglycerides to the periphery.\nHDL and LDL are both secreted into the blood. This process happens in the liver.

An organism's protein requirement can be expressed in terms of its demand for protein. The demand for protein is determined by the amount of protein needed to build new tissue, replace worn-out tissue, and maintain tissue that is necessary for life.\nAn organism's efficiency of utilization is determined by whether it can use the protein effectively. An organism's protein is used effectively when it is able to build new tissue and replace worn-out tissue.\nThe protein requirement is equal to the demand for protein divided by the efficiency of utilization. This equation shows that the protein requirement can be less than the demand for protein.\nSOLUTION: The demand for protein is the amount of protein needed to build new tissue, replace worn-out tissue, and maintain tissue that is necessary for life.\nThe efficiency of utilization is the proportion of protein that is used effectively.\nThe protein requirement is the demand for protein divided by the efficiency of utilization.\nThe protein requirement can be less than the demand for protein.

Risk management for chemical contaminants in food involves evaluating the potential for harm from a contaminant, the likelihood of exposure to the contaminant, and the effectiveness of various control options.\nThe most effective risk management strategies for chemical contaminants in food are those that rely on hazard reduction and use a risk-based approach. Hazard reduction involves reducing the hazard of a contaminant, either by reducing the amount of the contaminant in food or by removing the contaminant. A risk-based approach involves assessing the level of risk associated with a contaminant and comparing it to an acceptance criterion. The acceptance criterion is the level of risk that is considered acceptable.\nBanning the contaminant from food is a common risk management strategy for chemical contaminants in food. This strategy is effective when the contaminant poses a significant health risk.\nAllowing levels of contamination based on what manufacturers believe is achievable is not a risk-based approach.

It can produce glucose from noncarbohydrate sources, such as amino acids from protein. This process, called gluconeogenesis, can raise the blood glucose level.\nWhen the body has too much glucose from food or is producing too much from gluconeogenesis, the liver can convert glucose into a type of storage fat called glycogen. This process, called glycogenolysis, can lower the blood glucose level.\nThe liver can also convert glycogen back into glucose, a process called glycogenolysis. This process can raise the blood glucose level.\nThe pancreas has cells called beta cells that produce insulin. Insulin is necessary for cells to be able to use glucose from the blood.\nWhen the blood glucose level is high, the beta cells release insulin into the blood. Insulin lowers the blood glucose level by causing cells to take in glucose from the blood.\nWhen the blood glucose level is low, the beta cells stop releasing insulin. Without insulin, cells cannot take in glucose from the blood, and the blood glucose level continues to fall.\nSOLUTION: In the liver, gluconeogenesis is the process by which glucose is made from noncarbohydrate sources. The liver can use glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids to make glucose.\nThe deficiency of insulin, which is produced by the pancreas, causes the liver to use fewer amino acids and fatty acids for gluconeogenesis.

The body breaks down glucose from food and stores it as glycogen in the liver and muscles. Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose.\nGlucose can also be converted into other types of molecules, such as fatty acids and amino acids. These processes are called gluconeogenesis and amino acid synthesis, respectively. Gluconeogenesis can occur in many parts of the body, such as the liver, kidney, and intestine.\nAmino acid synthesis can occur in many parts of the body, such as the liver and kidney.\nThe body can break down glycogen and glucose for energy. Cells use a process called cellular respiration to break down glucose and release energy that is used to power cellular activities.\nWhen glucose is used for energy, it is broken down into carbon dioxide and water. When glucose is stored as glycogen or fat, the body stores energy in the form of bonds between atoms. The strength of these bonds takes energy to break. So, when glucose is converted back into usable energy, the bonds between atoms in the glucose molecule are broken. This process releases energy that is used to power cellular activities.\nSOLUTION: The correct statement about glucose metabolism is:\nRed blood cells can only metabolise glucose by anaerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.\nRed blood cells do not contain oxygen-carrying molecules, so they cannot use aerobic glycolysis. Instead, red blood cells use the pentose phosphate pathway to metabolise glucose.\nFructose is a type of sugar that can be used for gluconeogenesis in the liver.\nFructose is a type of sugar that can be converted into glucose. The liver can use fructose to synthesize glucose, which can be stored as glycogen.\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose. During glycolysis, one glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate.\nAerobic glycolysis is a type of glycolysis that uses oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis occurs in cells that have oxygen available, such as muscle cells. In these cells, aerobic glycolysis can extract more energy from glucose than anaerobic glycolysis.\nThe pentose phosphate pathway is a metabolic pathway that uses glucose to produce coenzyme Q and NADPH. These coenzymes help to metabolize glucose and produce energy."}

These folds and ridges increase the surface area of the intestine, which helps to improve the absorption of nutrients. The surface area of the small intestine is so great that it could cover a tennis court if it were spread out.\nThe small intestine absorbs water and nutrients from food. The process of absorption happens against a concentration gradient, which means that the intestine absorbs water that is higher concentration than in the surrounding fluid. This process requires energy.\nThe image below shows how water moves across the cells of the small intestine. The arrows show the direction of the water flow.\nThe blue arrows show the flow of water into the enterocytes. The red arrows show the flow of water out of the enterocytes. The process of osmosis is happening. Osmosis is the movement of water from a higher concentration to a lower concentration.\nThe image below shows a cross-section of the intestinal wall. The tight junctions are shown in green. Tight junctions are where the cells of the intestine are joined together.\nThe water can move through the intestinal wall by passing through the tight junctions. This shows how water moves from the enterocytes into the surrounding tissue.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C. Most water is absorbed by movement across the cells lining the gut, in a process called passive diffusion. Some water follows the movement of particles such as glucose and amino acids, which are absorbed by active transport."}

The liver and muscles are the main storage sites for glycogen.\nGlycogen is made of glucose molecules linked by a special type of bond called a glycosidic bond. The glucose molecules in glycogen can be linked in different ways, or isomers, to form different types of glycogen.\nWhen the body breaks down glycogen, it breaks the glycosidic bonds and turns the glucose molecules into free glucose. Free glucose enters the bloodstream and is used by cells throughout the body as a source of energy.\nThe hormones insulin and glucagon are involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism. When the body has too much glucose in the bloodstream, insulin is released to tell cells to take in glucose from the blood and store it in the form of glycogen. When the body needs more glucose, cells release glucagon, which tells the liver to release glucose from glycogen into the bloodstream.\nSOLUTION: The correct statement about glycogen metabolism is:\nIn muscle in the fasting state, glycogen is broken down to glucose 6-phosphate, then free glucose.\nWhen the body does not have enough food, the liver breaks down glycogen and converts it to glucose 6-phosphate. The body can then use glucose 6-phosphate to produce energy."}

{"question": "Which of the following statements about proteolysis is correct?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The rate of tissue protein catabolism is more or less constant throughout the day."}, {"label": "B", "text": "All tissue proteins undergo catabolism at more or less the same rate."}, {"label": "C", "text": "All proteins that are to be catabolised are tagged with the peptide ubiquitin."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lysosomal enzymes provide the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Proteins are broken down into their component amino acids during catabolism. This catabolism happens through a process called proteolysis, which is carried out by a variety of enzymes. The breakdown products of proteolysis are used to provide energy and to build new proteins.\nTissue protein catabolism is regulated in response to changes in nutrient availability. For example, when the nutrient glucose becomes available, the liver breaks down a protein called glycogen, which is stored in the liver and other tissues. Glycogen is broken down into glucose, which can be used by the body for energy.\nThe liver also has a central role in regulating the body's protein breakdown. When the liver has too much protein, it will break down its own protein and export the amino acids to other tissues. Other tissues can use these amino acids to build their own proteins or to break down their own proteins to provide amino acids for other tissues.\nSOLUTION: The rate of tissue protein catabolism is not constant throughout the day. It tends to be low during the day and night, and it increases after meals.\nAll tissue proteins do not undergo catabolism at the same rate. Different proteins have different rates of catabolism.\nAll proteins that are to be catabolised are not tagged with the peptide ubiquitin. Some proteins are broken down by proteases that do not require ubiquitin tagging.\nLysosomal enzymes do provide the mechanism for tissue protein catabolism. But proteases that are found in the cytoplasm also break down proteins."}

Enzymes bind to substrates, the molecules they act on, and are called substrate-binding enzymes.\nEnzymes also can be coenzymes. A coenzyme is a nonprotein molecule that can act as a substrate for an enzyme. One type of coenzyme, a cofactor, can be bound to an enzyme. Another type of coenzyme, a coenzyme A, is bound to a specific type of R group.\nSome enzymes have substrate-binding sites that can bind to two different types of substrates. These enzymes are called bifunctional enzymes. For example, in the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylation has a bifunctional substrate-binding site. One site binds to pyruvate, and the other site binds to acetyl-CoA.\nSOLUTION: Riboflavin is a vitamin that provides the coenzyme for oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate.\nRiboflavin is a precursor of the coenzyme FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide).

These pathways use enzymes to break down and build up chemicals. The chemicals in metabolic pathways are called metabolites.\nAs a metabolite is broken down or produced, it is converted from one form to another. For example, glucose is broken down to produce carbon dioxide and water. This is called metabolism.\nThe diagram below shows how glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids can be converted to other metabolites.\nSome organisms have metabolic pathways that convert different metabolites. For example, some organisms can make sugar from wood.\nSOLUTION: The rule that states fatty acids can be made from but not converted to carbohydrates and amino acids is central to the integration of metabolic pathways. This means that fatty acids are a precursor for carbohydrates and amino acids. A precursor is a metabolite that is converted to another metabolite."}

That is because the units are missing.\nNow look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 16 inches.\nThere are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.\nThink about trying to use the ruler to measure the height of a tree. You might need to stand on a stool to reach the top of the tree. The ruler is not telling you how high the tree is. This is because the units on the ruler are inches. You need a ruler that has feet as the units.\nSOLUTION: To assess growth in routine practice, you need to measure both weight and height. You can use the graph below to see how these two measurements go together.\nThis graph shows that a baby's weight and height usually go up together. As the baby gains weight, they also grow taller."}

LDL is commonly known as the \"bad\" cholesterol. It delivers cholesterol and other fats to the cells.\nWhen the cells receive LDL, they break down the lipids and use them for energy or repairs. If the cells receive too many lipids from LDL, the excess lipids will be converted into a substance called atherosclerotic plaque. This plaque can clog arteries and cause heart disease and strokes.\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the primary lipoprotein that carries cholesterol and other fats out of the body. HDL is known as the \"good\" cholesterol. It helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries.\nVery low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is a lipoprotein that is made in the liver and delivers triacylglycerols to the cells. The triacylglycerols are derived from dietary fats and from excess calories in the liver.\nChylomicrons are the largest lipoprotein particles. They are mostly made of triacylglycerols and are secreted into the blood by the digestive tract after a meal.\nSOLUTION: The liver secretes VLDL and chylomicrons that carry triacylglycerols and cholesterol to the cells. But VLDL is mostly made of triacylglycerols, and chylomicrons are too large to enter the cells. So, LDL is the primary lipoprotein secreted from the liver that is at least partially composed of dietary derived lipids."}

These proenzymes are inactive because their active sites are blocked by protective groups. As the enzymes travel through the small intestine, they are mixed with food and activated by the enzymes in saliva and pancreatic juice. Once activated, the enzymes cleave food molecules, making them smaller and simpler.\nMany enzymes are produced in the pancreas, a gland located behind the stomach. The pancreas secretes its enzymes into the small intestine along with pancreatic juice. The enzymes travel through the pancreatic duct and into the small intestine.\nSOLUTION: Pepsinogen is the chief enzyme which digests protein and requires removal of a peptide sequence from the active cleft before it can work.\nPepsinogen is a proenzyme that is inactive in the acidic environment of the stomach. When pepsinogen is mixed with food in the stomach, acid cleaves a peptide from the enzyme, making it active. This active enzyme can then digest protein.\nPancreatic \u00e1-amylase will hydrolyse starch to free glucose.\nPancreatic \u00e1-amylase is a proenzyme called amylopsin. When amylopsin enters the small intestine, it is mixed with food and activated by pH changes in the small intestine. Activated \u00e1-amylase can then cleave starch into smaller polysaccharide chains and into maltose.\nEnteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.\nTrypsin is a digestive enzyme that breaks down protein into smaller pieces. Trypsinogen is a proenzyme that contains the enzyme trypsin. Trypsinogen is inactive in the small intestine. When enteropeptidase comes in contact with trypsinogen, it cleaves a peptide from the enzyme, making it active. Active trypsin can then digest protein.\nPancreatic secretion of hydrochloric acid is required to provide the correct pH for maximal pancreatic enzyme activity in the duodenum.\nThe correct pH range for the activation of pancreatic enzymes is 6.0 to 7.5. The pH of pancreatic juice is about 8.0. So, the pancreas secretes hydrochloric acid into the duodenum to lower the duodenal pH to the correct range. This acid is produced by cells in the lining of the pancreas."}

Hormones help to coordinate the activities of different parts of an organism.\nThe hypothalamus is a gland located in the brain that produces hormones that regulate a variety of bodily functions. The hypothalamus responds to hormones produced by other glands in the body to maintain balance and stability within the body.\nWhen the levels of blood sugar (glucose) start to rise, the pancreas gland releases insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin has a regulatory effect on the body. It causes body cells to take in more glucose from the bloodstream. As glucose is taken in, the level of glucose in the bloodstream starts to decrease.\nThe insulin response helps to maintain a balance of glucose in the bloodstream. Too little insulin will result in too much glucose in the bloodstream. Too much insulin will cause glucose levels to drop too low.\nThe thyroid gland is a gland located in the neck. The thyroid gland produces two hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones regulate the rate of metabolism in the body.\nThe hypothalamus controls the production of T3 and T4 by the thyroid gland. When the body's metabolism is too low, the hypothalamus produces thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH causes the thyroid gland to produce and release T3 and T4 into the bloodstream.\nThe T3 and T4 hormones are part of the response that helps to maintain a balance of metabolism in the body. Too little T3 and T4 will cause the metabolism to slow down. Too much T3 and T4 will cause the metabolism to speed up.\nSOLUTION: The hypothalamus acts on the pancreas to increase satiety and hunger.\nThe pancreas produces insulin, and insulin has a regulatory effect on the body. Insulin causes body cells to take in glucose from the bloodstream. As glucose is taken in, the level of glucose in the bloodstream starts to decrease.\nWhen the hypothalamus senses that the body's glucose levels are too low, it releases a hormone called glucagon. Glucagon has the opposite effect of insulin. It causes body cells to release glucose into the bloodstream. As glucose is released into the bloodstream, the level of glucose in the bloodstream starts to increase.\nSo, leptin and insulin act on the hypothalamus to increase satiety and hunger."}

Over time, the food in cans can lose some of its vitamins and nutritional value. But you can still eat canned food that has gone bad. It just might not taste as good, and it will have fewer vitamins.\nHow canned food goes bad:\nThe food in cans is sealed in to keep out air. But over time, some of the air inside the can might escape, and some of the oxygen in the headspace of the can might seep into the food. This can cause the food to lose its fresh taste and some of its vitamins.\nThe amount of oxygen in the headspace of a canned food is called the headspace oxygen level. The headspace oxygen level can affect how quickly the food in a can will go bad.\nHow to store canned food to make it last longer:\nTo help keep your canned food from going bad, store it in a cool, dry place.\nIf you have a cool, dry place in your house, you can store canned food there.\nIf you store canned food in a garage or basement, make sure it is not in a place where it will be exposed to direct sunlight or temperatures above 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C).\nDo not store canned food in a attic or in a car.\nHow long canned food can last:\nThe shelf life of canned food depends on the type of food and the storage conditions.\nHere are some general guidelines:\nAcidic foods, such as most fruits and vegetables, can last for 1 to 2 years.\nLow-acid canned foods, such as meat, fish, and tomatoes, can last for 2 to 5 years.\nHigh-acid canned foods, such as tomatoes and fruits, can last for 6 months to 1 year.\nIf you are not sure about the shelf life of a canned food, look at the can.

{"question": "Which statement best describes the differences between the characteristics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes:\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "persons with type 2 diabetes usually require lower doses of insulin than person with type 1 diabetes because they have a milder form of diabetes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "persons with type 1 diabetes rapidly develop chronic complications"}, {"label": "C", "text": "autoimmune factors are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 but not type 2 diabetes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "persons with type 1 diabetes can increase endogenous insulin production by taking oral hypoglycemic agents"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are both chronic conditions that involve the pancreas, a gland located behind the stomach. The pancreas secretes hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, that help the body use sugar (glucose).\nIn type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This type of diabetes mostly affects children and young adults.\nIn type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to insulin or the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin. This type of diabetes is more common in adults and is increasingly being seen in children.\nThere are many similarities between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both types of diabetes require lifelong management to keep blood sugar levels under control. Good control of blood sugar levels can help prevent diabetes complications.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nAutoimmune factors are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 but not type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This attack is believed to be triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin because the body is resistant to insulin.\nType 1 and type 2 diabetes are similar in that they are both chronic diseases that require lifelong management. But there are some differences. For example, type 1 diabetes usually develops quickly, often in children or young adults. Type 2 diabetes usually occurs in adults and may be linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity and lack of exercise."}

Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia, such as weakness and fatigue, can also be caused by infection.\nWhen a person is infected, the body releases inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and acute-phase proteins. These substances can cause the release of iron from macrophages, which can lead to an increase in ferritin levels. So, a high ferritin level does not necessarily mean that a person is not iron deficient.\nIn addition, the presence of an infection can affect the levels of other iron status markers. For example, hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron absorption, can increase in response to infection. This can decrease serum iron and iron binding capacity, and increase transferrin receptors.\nSOLUTION: A person with both iron deficiency and a severe infection is likely to have low levels of hemoglobin, low ferritin, and high serum transferrin receptors.\nA person with iron deficiency anaemia will have low levels of hemoglobin.

{"question": "Which single statement below, about the stomach, is actually correct?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Acid secretion occurs in response to secretion of the hormone, carbonic anhydrase"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Glands called Peyer's patches are responsible for acid secretion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The vagus nerve inhibits acid secretion after a meal has been consumed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pepsinogen and gastric lipase are two enzymes secreted into the lumen of the stomach"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The stomach breaks down food by secreting digestive enzymes into its lumen (the space within the stomach) and by mixing the food with these enzymes. The lining of the stomach provides a safe environment for these enzymes to break down the food.\nThe stomach wall has gastric pits and gastric glands. Gastric pits release digestive enzymes into the lumen of the stomach. Gastric glands produce and secrete digestive enzymes into the lumen of the stomach.\nSOLUTION: The correct statement is that pepsinogen and gastric lipase are two enzymes secreted into the lumen of the stomach.\nPepsinogen is secreted into the lumen of the stomach, where it is converted to the enzyme pepsin. Pepsin breaks down proteins in the food.\nGastric lipase is an enzyme secreted into the lumen of the stomach. It breaks down fats in the food.\nAcid secretion occurs in response to secretion of the hormone, carbonic anhydrase.\nThis statement is incorrect. In response to food entering the stomach, the stomach secretes digestive enzymes into the lumen of the stomach. The hormone carbonic anhydrase does not play a role in this process.\nGlands called Peyer's patches are responsible for acid secretion.\nThis statement is incorrect. Peyer's patches are part of the immune system. They do not produce or secrete acids into the stomach.\nThe vagus nerve inhibits acid secretion after a meal has been consumed.\nThis statement is incorrect. The vagus nerve inhibits acid secretion before a meal has been consumed. It does this by signaling the stomach to produce a hormone called gastrin. Gastrin stimulates the cells that produce stomach acid to do so."}

A nutritional status is the combination of a person's diet and their body's response to that diet. Poor nutritional status can lead to deficiency diseases and other health problems.\nMany diseases are associated with nutritional deficiencies or excesses. For example, heart disease is associated with high blood levels of fat and cholesterol, which are found in many nutrients in the food we eat. Diabetes is caused by an inability to produce or use insulin, a hormone that helps cells turn sugar into energy. Obesity is associated with an excessive consumption of calories, which are found in foods and drinks.\nFolate and vitamin B12 are both involved in the production of DNA, the genetic material in cells. Folate deficiency can lead to anemia and can also cause damage to the nervous system. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause anemia and nerve damage.\nThe table below shows how different nutrients are associated with certain health outcomes.\nNutrient | Disease or health outcome\nFolate | Anemia; nerve damage\nVitamin B12 | Anemia; nerve damage\nCalcium | Strong bones; teeth\nPhosphorus | Strong bones; teeth\nIron | Anemia\nZinc | Immune system function\nSome of these relationships are not direct. For example, calcium and phosphorus are both involved in building strong bones and teeth. But consuming too much phosphorus can cause an imbalance in the body's nutrient levels. Too much iron can cause damage to organs and tissues.\nSOLUTION: Many older people have low levels of vitamin B12. This is because the body's ability to absorb vitamin B12 from food decreases as people age. Some older people have anemia or nerve damage as a result.\nFolate is found in many foods, but some people may have trouble getting enough. Some people have a genetic inability to produce or use folate, which can lead to anemia during their lives.\nThere is strong evidence that vitamin B12 supplements can improve cognitive function in older people. Many older people have cognitive decline, which can be a precursor to dementia.\nThere is strong evidence that folate deficiency is less prevalent in countries with mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid. Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate.\nOlder people are no more likely to have low hemoglobin concentration than younger people.\nHypertension in older people is unlikely to be associated with high salt intake."}

They are found in all cells and are the main way that cells transport lipids, or fats, through the bloodstream.\nLipoproteins are made by the cell's smooth endoplasmic reticulum and are transported to the Golgi, where they are packaged and shipped to the cell membrane.\nLipoproteins are important for the body's metabolism, as they are involved in the transport of lipids between different cells and between the bloodstream and cells.\nThe exogenous lipoprotein pathway is one of two main ways in which lipoproteins can be made and cleared. In this pathway, lipids are transferred to apoB-100, a protein that forms the core of the lipoprotein particle. The apoB-100 particle then recruits other proteins to form the mature lipoprotein particle. This particle can bind to receptors on the cell membrane, allowing lipids to be taken up by the cell.\nThe exogenous pathway is used to make most of the lipoproteins in the body, including very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), and low density lipoproteins (LDL). These lipoproteins are made by the liver and are released into the bloodstream.\nThe endogenous lipoprotein pathway is an ancient pathway that is used to make high density lipoproteins (HDL). HDL is made in the liver and is released into the bloodstream."}

When designing studies, researchers must make choices that affect whether the study will answer the question at hand. One important choice is the type of study design.\nThere are many ways to design a study. Some types of studies are more powerful than others. A powerful study is one that is able to accurately prove a true association.\nA randomized controlled trial is the most powerful type of study design. In a randomized controlled trial, participants are randomly assigned to a treatment group and a control group. The researchers can then compare the two groups to see if the treatment had an effect.\nOther types of studies are less powerful. One example is a case-control study. A case-control study looks back at people who have already experienced a health problem. The study then looks at the choices or experiences of those people to see if any factors increase the risk of the health problem.\nStudies are also affected by their sample size. A sample is a group of participants in a study. The sample size is the number of participants in the study. A larger sample size means that the study is more likely to accurately represent the population.\nSOLUTION: The best way to prove an association between diet and skeletal health is with long-term intervention studies that have a large sample size with fracture as an endpoint.\nIn a long-term intervention study, people are followed over a long period of time. This type of study can prove whether an exposure is associated with a health problem.\nA large sample size is needed to get accurate results. With a large sample size, the study is more likely to accurately represent the population.\nMeasuring bone remodelling through biochemical markers is another way to prove an association between diet and skeletal health.\nExperimental studies which have a one-off measure of bone mineral density and bone mineral content are not as powerful as the other types of research findings. These studies can provide evidence, but they are not as strong as the other types.\nCase reports from individual patients are not useful for proving an association between diet and skeletal health. A case report is a description of what happened to one person. It is not scientific evidence."}

The genetic information in DNA is passed from parents to offspring.\nAn organism's proteins do many jobs, such as repairing cells and tissues, reactions in cells, and the formation and function of organs. Proteins are made of smaller molecules called amino acids.\nThe genetic information in DNA is encoded in the order of its nucleotides, or bases. The sequence of a nucleotide in DNA is called a base. Two bases are paired together, forming a base pair. The four base pairs are adenine-thymine and cytosine-guanine.\nThe sequence of base pairs in DNA encodes the sequence of amino acids in a protein. During transcription, the cell uses an enzyme called RNA polymerase to create a molecule of mRNA from one strand of the DNA molecule. The mRNA molecule is created in the 5' to 3' direction, with the direction of transcription indicated by the arrow. The mRNA molecule is created from the same strand of DNA as the mRNA.\nDuring translation, the cell uses ribosomes to make a protein from an mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the sequence of bases in the mRNA, using the sequence to assemble the correct sequence of amino acids. The amino acids are attached to one another by peptide bonds formed by an enzyme in the ribosome.\nThere are four kinds of nitrogenous bases in DNA. Each base is represented by its first letter. The bases pair with each other as shown in the table below.\nBase | Pair\nA | C, G\nC | A, G\nG | C, T\nT | A, G\nDuring transcription, the cell uses an RNA molecule to replace the base in the DNA strand. The RNA nucleotides are paired with the DNA nucleotides. The base that is not paired with a nucleotide in the DNA strand is in the coding strand.\nThe coding strand is the strand that has the information that the cell uses to build proteins. The other strand is called the noncoding strand. The noncoding strand does not have information about proteins.\nThe RNA molecule that is formed during transcription is called a messenger RNA, or mRNA. The mRNA molecule is made in the 5' to 3' direction. This direction is indicated by the arrow.\nThe mRNA molecule can be modified after it is made. For example, a nucleotide can be added to the end of the mRNA. These modifications can affect how the mRNA is used.\nAfter an mRNA molecule is made, it is taken to a ribosome. A ribosome reads the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA. The ribosome uses the information to figure out which amino acids to join.\nThe amino acids are joined by peptide bonds. A peptide bond is formed when the chemicals in the ribosome react. The peptide bond links the amino acids together.\nThe protein is made in the ribosome. The protein can then be used in a cell. For example, a protein can be used to make a cell's parts.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nThe mRNA formed by transcription of a region of DNA undergoes splicing and further modifications to form mRNA.\nDuring splicing, the cell removes introns from the mRNA. Introns are sequences within a gene that do not contain information about a protein.\nThe cell also adds exons to the mRNA.
