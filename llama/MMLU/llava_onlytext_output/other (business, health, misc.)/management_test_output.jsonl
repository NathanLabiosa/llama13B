An economy is a complex system, and when many people make decisions at the same time, the results can be difficult to predict. For example, if many people decide to spend their money on luxury items, the total amount spent may be more than the economy produces. This situation is called a surplus.\nIf many people decide to save their money, the total amount saved may be more than people invest in starting new businesses or expanding existing businesses. This situation is called a shortage.\nWhen there is a surplus or a shortage, the market price for a good or service will change. The price will change until the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.\nWhen the price of a good or service changes, the amount supplied and the amount demanded will change as well. For example, if the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied will increase, and the quantity demanded will decrease.\nSOLUTION: Milton Friedman, an economist, believed that individualism was the best guide for a moral philosophy. Individualism is the idea that people should be free to do as they please as long as they do not harm others.\nAccording to Friedman, individualism is also the best guide for a economic philosophy.

Text has a permanent, stable, and transferable quality. It is permanent in that it does not need to be said in real time. It is stable in that you can refer back to it. It is transferable in that you can share it with someone else.\nFor example, consider a face-to-face conversation with a salesperson. The salesperson tells you about a new product. You can ask questions and get more information. But you have to memorize all the details or write them down. If you want to tell someone else about the product, you have to remember or write down all the details again.\nA sales brochure is a richer form of information than a face-to-face conversation. The brochure has all the details about the product. It is permanent, stable, and transferable. You can refer to the brochure whenever you want to.\nSo, in the age of ubiquitous technology, the richest form of information is text."}

The organization is divided into departments, or functions, based on their expertise.\nFor example, a manufacturing company may have departments for design, engineering, manufacturing, and quality control. Each department has specialized professionals who handle tasks related to their area of expertise.\nSOLUTION: Organizations use functional structures when they need to have a high degree of specialization. In a functional structure, employees are organized by their skills and expertise.\nFunctional structures can help create specialization by putting employees with similar skills and expertise into the same department. This allows employees to become highly skilled in their areas of specialization.\nFor example, a company's marketing department may have specialized employees who are experts in market research, advertising, and public relations."}

Different situations call for different leadership styles. The effectiveness of a leader depends on how well he or she fits the situation.\nContingency theorists identify specific factors of a situation that must be matched with appropriate leader behaviors in order to achieve the best outcome. For example, a leader must be directive when working with a new, inexperienced team, but must be supportive when working with a highly skilled, experienced team.\nPath-goal theorists focus on the goals of the leader and the followers. They identify specific leader behaviors that are effective when following a particular path to achieve certain goals. For example, a leader must be both directive and supportive when following a path of innovation to achieve goals that are distant but important.\nSOLUTION: Look at the way each writer has contributed to the contingency theory of leadership:\nRosabeth Kanter has done research on how a leader's style affects organizational culture and change.\nJoan Woodward has written about the impact of context on the effectiveness of leaders.\nRensis Likert has conducted research on the relationships among leadership, informal power, and organizational behavior.\nFred Fiedler has conducted research on the best and worst leadership styles for different situations."}

A hierarchy of authority: A bureaucracy has a clear hierarchy, with each position having a specific level of authority.\n2. Clear rules and division of labor: Bureaucracies have clear rules that tell workers what is expected of them and how to perform their jobs. They also have a division of labor, which means that each worker is responsible for a specific part of the job.\n3. Formal procedures: Bureaucracies use formal procedures for making decisions and getting things done. This means that workers are expected to follow specific steps when completing a task.\n4. Impersonality: Bureaucracies treat all workers equally and impersonally. This means that bureaucracies do not show favoritism and are not influenced by personal relationships.\nSOLUTION: Merton was concerned with how workers cope with the norms of bureaucracies.\nMerton believed that bureaucracies have three types of norms:\n1. Innovative norms: These norms encourage workers to look for new ways to improve the bureaucracy.\n2. Conventional norms: These norms encourage workers to follow established procedures.\n3. Ritualistic norms: These norms encourage workers to use the bureaucracy as a reference group.\nMerton believed that workers can respond to these norms in different ways.
