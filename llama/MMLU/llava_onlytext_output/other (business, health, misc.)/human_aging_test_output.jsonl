Flipping a switch is all it takes to turn on a light, charge a cell phone, or operate a computer. But generating electricity is the backbone of the global energy industry, and it takes many forms.\nSome electricity is generated using fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas. These fossil fuels are nonrenewable, which means they will run out eventually. In contrast, electricity generated from renewable sources, such as solar power and wind power, is clean, abundant, and sustainable.\nRenewable energy sources and fossil fuels are the two main types of electricity generation.\nRenewable energy sources include hydroelectric power, wind power, geothermal power, and solar power.\nHydroelectric power uses water to generate electricity. The water is turned into steam, which spins a turbine. The turbine is connected to a generator, which produces electricity.\nWind power uses the wind to generate electricity. Wind turbines are used to convert the wind into electricity.\nGeothermal power uses the earth's heat to generate electricity. Geothermal power plants can use steam or hot water from geysers and hot springs to generate electricity.\nSolar power uses sunlight to generate electricity. Solar panels are used to convert sunlight into electricity.\nFossil fuels include coal, natural gas, and oil. These fuels are formed from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.\nCoal is the most abundant fossil fuel. It is a solid fuel that is mainly used to produce electricity.\nNatural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel.

Genes are pieces of hereditary material that are passed down through families. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSOLUTION: Activation of a class of genes called sirtuins may help to prevent some diseases. Sirtuins are a class of genes that may help to improve cellular metabolism and prevent diseases.\nSirtuins are involved in stress response and inflammation, which are associated with many diseases.

This adjustment, called dark adaptation, takes place over several minutes.\nDark adaptation happens when the light levels outside the eye decrease. The number of rods and cones in the eye outnumbers the cones by about 20 million to 1. Rods are much more sensitive to light than cones. This means that under very dark conditions, with no light present, only the rods can detect light.\nSOLUTION: As cells in the eye that respond to low levels of illumination, nocturnal detectors make their own light. This light is called bioluminescence. Cone cells can detect most of the colors that the eye can see. But cones are not as sensitive to light as rods.\nRods and cones are both types of cells in the retina. But rods and cones are not the same cells."}

Senescence can be caused by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.\nIntrinsic factors are caused by the body's natural processes. Cells and organs can be damaged by normal wear and tear, by exposure to toxins, or by the buildup of waste.\nExtrinsic factors are caused by the environment. Cells and organs can be damaged by exposure to things in the environment, such as radiation or toxins.\nSOLUTION: The least favored theory of senescence among researchers is the Garbage accumulation theory.\nCells use nutrients to survive. If a cell has too much waste or too few nutrients, it may not function properly. The garbage accumulation theory of aging suggests that as cells accumulate waste, they become damaged and may not function properly."}

These benefits may help explain why people who are highly religious are, on average, happier and more satisfied with their lives than people who are not religious.\nReligious practices can also help people manage stress and anxiety. For example, prayer and meditation can help people feel calm and relaxed.\nSOLUTION: The positive relationship between religion and physical health is not due to the rules of some religions which forbid unhealthy behaviors. Many religious people do not follow all of the rules of their religion, and the positive relationship between religion and health remains.\nThe positive relationship between religion and physical health is not due to the benefits of knowing that others are praying for you. Praying for someone else can indeed make you feel closer to that person, but the health improvements are due to the stress-reducing effects of prayerful meditation.\nThe positive relationship between religion and physical health is due, in part, to the social support derived from a religious community. Religious people often feel more socially supported than do nonreligious people, and social support is linked to better health."}

These increases have resulted in part from advances in medicine and health care.\nSOLUTION: The Baby Boom generation is a major reason for the increase in numbers of older adults. Between 1946 and 1964, the United States saw a significant increase in the birth rate. This increase led to a surge in the number of people born in the United States during that time.\nThe steadily increasing birth rate is a major reason for the increase in numbers of older adults. Since the 1970s, the birth rate in the United States has increased. This increase has led to a higher number of people entering retirement age in the past 30 to 40 years.\nIncreases in life expectancy at a specified age is a major reason for the increase in numbers of older adults. Life expectancy at age 65 has increased from about 15 years to 20 years. This means that people are living 20 years in retirement."}

It's essential to show respect to others, but it's especially important when it comes to elders. Here are some ways in which elders have often contributed to society:\nThey are much older than we are.\nElders have lived longer than we have, which means they have more experience and can help pass on cultural values.\nThey raised us.\nElders raised us, and taught us how to survive and thrive in the world.\nThey ask nothing in return.\nElders often contribute to their communities without expecting anything in return. This unselfish behavior is a virtue.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nElders ask nothing in return for their contributions to society. They raise children, for example, and often make many sacrifices to ensure that their children have better lives. Elders also contribute to their communities in many ways, such as by volunteering, voting, and sharing their knowledge and experience."}

When a trait is passed from parents to offspring, the trait must be adapted to the environment in which the offspring live. If a trait contributes to an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment, then the trait is considered to be adapted.\nAn adaptation may have pleiotropic effects. A pleiotropic effect occurs when a gene has multiple effects on an organism. One of the effects may be adaptive, but the other effects may not. For example, the gene for human language has a pleiotropic effect: it contributes to both language and normal ear development. The adaptation for language is important for human survival and reproduction, but the adaptation for normal ear development is not.\nSome adaptations are antagonistic. An adaptation is antagonistic if it has opposite effects on different parts of an organism. Antagonistic pleiotropy may create a conflict within an organism, as the different parts of the organism move in opposite directions. For example, the gene for human hair color has an antagonistic pleiotropic effect: the version of the gene that causes red hair also increases the risk of skin cancer, while the version of the gene that does not cause red hair decreases the risk of skin cancer.\nSome theories suggest that antagonistic pleiotropy may be one reason why aging exists. An adaptation for reproduction may have an antagonistic pleiotropic effect on aging. For example, an adaptation that helps an organism reproduce more quickly may also increase the risk of aging.\nSOLUTION: One line of evidence against antagonistic pleiotropy is that women who have more children tend to live longer. This pattern of life history, known as the Bateman principle, may be an adaptation to the higher risk of mortality that children face. The principle describes how the risk of mortality tends to increase in both parents after they have children. This increase in risk may be balanced by the advantage that children provide in terms of passing genes to the next generation."}

Some of the factors that can cause a loss of muscle fiber include:\n1. Loss of neurons. Neurons are nerve cells that help muscles contract. Loss of neurons can occur due to aging, conditions such as diabetes, and exposure to toxins such as lead.\n2. Clogged blood vessels. Clogged blood vessels can starve muscles of the oxygen and nutrients they need to function. Clogged blood vessels can be caused by conditions such as atherosclerosis.\n3. Loss of collagen. Collagen is a protein that gives muscles and other tissues strength. Loss of collagen can occur due to aging.\n4. Changes in hormone levels. Hormones are chemicals that can affect many processes in the body. Changes in hormone levels can affect muscle fibers. For example, hormone changes can occur with conditions such as hypothyroidism.\n5. Loss of bone density. Bones provide a solid foundation for muscles to work against. Loss of bone density can occur with conditions such as osteoporosis.\nSOLUTION: Loss of collagen is a factor that can cause a loss of muscle fiber. This means that collagen is a necessary component of muscle fibers.\nThe other answer choices are not correct. Clogged blood vessels can cause muscles to weaken, but they do not cause a loss of muscle fiber. Loss of neurons can cause a loss of muscle fiber, but loss of bone density and changes in hormone levels do not."}

Telomeres protect the ends of chromosomes from degradation.\nTelomeres shorten each time a cell divides. When telomeres get too short, the cell can no longer divide. This is called a cellular senescence. Cells in a state of senescence can affect the body in different ways. For example, senescent cells can release substances that can cause inflammation. Inflammation can be a factor in many diseases.\nSOLUTION: An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is determined by the alleles the organism inherits. An organism's phenotype for a trait is also determined by the organism's combination of alleles, but some traits, like blood type, are influenced by environmental factors.\nAn organism's environment can affect its observable version of a trait, but the organism's genes do not have alleles for environment. For example, a person's weight is a trait affected by both genes and environment. Some genes can affect a person's weight, but being overweight or obese is also influenced by a person's food environment and level of physical activity.\nSOLUTION: An organism's initial length of telomere is determined genetically. This means that an organism's length of telomere is affected by the organism's genes, not the environment."}

The process of retrieving a memory can be affected by many things, including the type of memory and the age of the person.\nThere are two main types of memory: sensory and long-term. Sensory memory holds things that you have seen or heard for a very short time. Long-term memory stores things that you have seen or heard for a longer time.\nLong-term memory can be further divided into three types: short-term memory, intermediate-term memory, and long-term memory.\nShort-term memory is where you hold information for a short time, like when you are counting to 20.\nIntermediate-term memory is where you hold information for a slightly longer time, like when you are working on a puzzle.\nLong-term memory is where you hold information for a very long time, like where you put your keys.\nMemory can be affected by age.

Some parts of an organism grow and change more quickly than other parts. This change can cause problems and lead to diseases.\nTheories of aging can help explain why some diseases, such as cancer, occur. They can also help researchers find ways to prevent or treat these diseases.\nThere are many theories of aging. One of the most widely accepted is the free radical theory.\nThe free radical theory explains that cells are damaged by waste products called free radicals. Free radicals are made by cells during normal metabolism. But some cells can also make free radicals in response to environmental toxins, such as cigarettes.\nFree radicals can damage cells, including DNA, the genetic material that contains a cell's instructions. This damage can cause cells to work incorrectly.\nCells usually fixed this damage. But as people age, the cells' ability to fix damage decreases. This damage accumulates, and it can lead to diseases such as cancer and heart disease.\nSOLUTION: The free radical theory is a theory of aging. The ability of an organism to complete a task depends on the fit between the environment and the organism. This idea is a basic part of the free radical theory."}

These changes may include retirement, the death of friends or loved ones, and a change in health. It is normal for older adults to feel lonely or sad at times. But too much loneliness or sadness can be a problem.\nBeing lonely or socially isolated means you have fewer social relationships or social interactions. Loneliness and social isolation can be caused by many things, such as moving to a new place, retiring, or losing a loved one.\nOlder adults with higher education and self-esteem are more likely to be socially active and have fulfilling relationships. They are also more likely to have a strong sense of self-esteem, which can help them cope with the normal stresses of aging."}

The body needs cells to function properly. Free radicals are cells that have an unstable oxygen molecule in their cells. These unstable molecules can cause harmful effects on the body.\nWhen free radicals are formed in the body, they can cause damage to cells and tissues. This damage can cause many health problems. The body has a defense system that can neutralize free radicals and prevent them from causing damage.\nOne part of the defense system is the body's own built-in antioxidants. The body produces substances called antioxidants that neutralize free radicals. Other substances called antioxidants are found in some foods.\nAnother part of the defense system is enzymes. Enzymes are special proteins that can speed up chemical reactions in the body. The body produces enzymes that can neutralize free radicals.\nA third part of the defense system is the body's own cells and tissues. Some cells and tissues can neutralize free radicals.\nSOLUTION: The body's own built-in defense against free radicals is called antioxidant defense. This defense includes antioxidants, enzymes, and cells and tissues.\nThe body uses antioxidants to neutralize free radicals. Some nutrients in the diet can act as antioxidants in the body. These nutrients include vitamin C and vitamin E.\nSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme that neutralizes free radicals. The body produces SOD in cells.\nTelomerase is an enzyme that helps protect the body's genes. Some cells in the body produce telomerase."}

Evidence shows that well-being levels peak in middle age and then decline. This decline may be due to health problems, which are more common in older adults. However, older adults have a sense of well-being that is independent of their health. This independent well-being is created by the activities and social connections that older adults have."}
