The shape of the uterus changes during labor to help the fetus move down the birth canal.\nThe bottom of the uterus is the fundus. The top of the uterus is the crown. The width of the uterus is the circumference.\nDuring pregnancy, the fundus expands as the fetus grows. The size of the fundus changes during the pregnancy. The size of the fundus can be used to estimate the number of weeks of pregnancy.\nThe cervix is the lower, narrow part of the uterus that sticks out of the vagina. The cervix has a small opening between the cells of the cervix. This opening is called the os.\nDuring labor, the cervix thins and opens so that the fetus can pass through the cervix and be born. The cervix is 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) long and is located in the lower, central part of the bottom of the uterus.\nThe uterus has two ring-like structures at the top called the right and left uterine rings. These structures help to hold the fetus in place.\nThe uterus also has a muscular wall that helps to push the fetus out during labor.\nSOLUTION: The most likely diagnosis is primary dysfunctional labor. This means that the uterus is not working properly during labor.\nThe cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. This means that the cervix is thinner and has opened up more than usual. But the woman is not having regular contractions.\nThe other possible diagnosis is hypotonic uterine dysfunction. This means that the uterus is too weak during labor. The cervix is thinner and has opened up more than usual. But the woman is not having regular contractions.\nThe woman does not have an obstruction. The fetal heart tones are normal. The fetal head is engaged. The membranes are intact. And the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated."}

This laboratory procedure involves several steps.\nFirst, a technician makes a reaction mixture that contains oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. The oligonucleotides are designed to bind to specific regions of the CMV genome. The polymerase enzyme is responsible for copying the genome. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA.\nNext, the reaction mixture is placed in a device that can heat and cool the mixture. The mixture is heated to a high temperature, which breaks the chemical bonds in the DNA molecules. Then, the mixture is cooled, and the polymerase enzyme can copy the DNA molecules. This process is called amplification. The amplified DNA is then heated again to break the bonds in the DNA molecules. The oligonucleotides and polymerase are then free to react with the amplified DNA. This process is called annealing. The cooled mixture is then heated again to form a new set of chemical bonds. This process is called extension. The extension step is speeded up by the polymerase enzyme. As a result of this process, many copies of the CMV genome are made.\nFinally, the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. In this process, the mixture is placed in a gel that is formed by agarose, a substance that is made from algae. The gel is then placed in an electromagnetic field. The substances in the mixture move through the gel, but their movement is slowed by the gel. As a result, the fragments of DNA are separated by size. When the fragments of DNA are detected, they appear as a dark band on the gel.\nSOLUTION: The patient's blood is reacted in a mixture containing oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. This laboratory procedure is called a polymerase chain reaction. The reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis.

One week ago, she was treated in the emergency department after she accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg while working at a fast-food restaurant. Examination of the left lower extremity shows a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound. The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "P-selectin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stromelysin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vascular endothelial growth factor"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Edema is a build-up of fluid in body tissues. Edema can occur when there is an imbalance among the forces that normally regulate the amount of fluid in the tissues. The forces that regulate tissue fluid include the hydrostatic pressure that builds up against the capillary walls, the blood plasma proteins, and the ability of the capillary walls to act as a filter.\nWhen the hydrostatic pressure increases or the capillary walls become more permeable, the fluid from the plasma leaks out into the tissues. This leakage leads to the accumulation of fluid in the tissues, or edema.\nThe formation of edema is also influenced by the amount of fluid that is extravasated and the ability of the tissues to absorb this fluid. Some tissues, such as the lungs, contain large, thin-walled capillaries that are poor filters. As a result, when fluid leaks out of the capillaries in the lungs, a large amount of fluid accumulates in the tissues.\nOther tissues, such as the brain, have a small number of large capillaries that are good filters. As a result, when fluid leaks out of the capillaries in the brain, a smaller amount of fluid accumulates in the tissues.\nSOLUTION: Look at the formation of the tissue. The tissue is described as pink, soft, granular, and edematous. Granular and edematous both describe the tissue as being swollen. So, the tissue was most likely formed as a result of increased activity of stromelysin.\nStromelysin is an enzyme that is produced by cells in response to injury. Stromelysin breaks down the extracellular matrix, a group of molecules that binds cells together in tissues. When stromelysin breaks down the extracellular matrix, it creates a area that cells can invade. This process is called matrix remodeling.\nThe other choices describe molecules that are involved in inflammation or blood clotting. But they do not describe the formation of the tissue."}

The primary mechanism that leads to edema is an increase in hydrostatic pressure. When capillaries leak fluid into the surrounding tissue, the hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries rises. The higher hydrostatic pressure then draws more fluid into the interstitial space.\nThe volume of fluid in the interstitial space is determined by the hydrostatic pressure and the surface tension of the capillary walls. The surface tension acts to keep the capillary walls together and to keep the fluid in the capillaries. As the hydrostatic pressure rises, the surface tension must increase to compensate in order to keep the fluid in the capillaries. But when the hydrostatic pressure rises too high, the surface tension can no longer support the weight of the fluid, and the capillaries begin to leak.\nThe figure below shows how increased hydrostatic pressure can lead to edema. The capillaries in the tissue normally have a hydrostatic pressure of 5 to 20 millimeters of mercury. When the hydrostatic pressure reaches 30 millimeters of mercury, the capillary walls begin to leak. The fluid leaks into the surrounding tissue, and the volume of the fluid in the interstitial space increases."}

If the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, which of the following Starling forces is most likely to change in the glomeruli?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Decreased hydrostatic pressure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Decreased oncotic pressure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increased hydrostatic pressure"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The kidney is an essential organ that performs the vital function of filtering waste and excess substances from the blood. As shown in the figure below, the kidney is made of two main parts: the outer layer (cortex) and the inner layer (medulla).\nThe cortex is made of many small blood vessels called arterioles. The arterioles divide and branch into many smaller blood vessels called capillaries. The capillaries in the cortex are connected to the medulla by large veins called venules.\nThe glomerulus is the part of the nephron, the basic unit of the kidney. A kidney has about a million glomeruli.\nThe glomerulus is made of a tiny blood vessel (capillary) called a glomerular arteriole and a capsule that is made of connective tissue. The glomerular arteriole carries blood to the glomerulus. The other blood vessels carry blood away from the glomerulus.\nThe glomerular capsule surrounds the glomerular arteriole. The space between the glomerular arteriole and the glomerular capsule is called the glomerular filtration space. This space is filled with a filter of capillary walls.\nThe pressure of the blood in the glomerular arteriole is called the blood pressure. The blood pressure is determined by the pressure of the blood in the afferent arteriole. The afferent arteriole is the arteriole that carries blood to the glomerulus.\nThe blood pressure and the volume of blood in the glomerular filtration space are the Starling forces that affect the amount of filtration.\nThe filtration coefficient (Kf) is a measure of the amount of filtration. The Kf depends on the blood pressure and the volume of the glomerular filtration space.\nIf the blood pressure increases, the Kf increases. This is because the increased pressure forces more blood through the filter.\nIf the volume of the glomerular filtration space decreases, the Kf decreases. This is because there is less space for the blood to filter through.\nThe hydrostatic pressure is the pressure of the blood. The hydrostatic pressure is determined by the blood pressure.\nThe oncotic pressure is the pressure exerted by the proteins in the blood. The oncotic pressure is determined by the volume of the blood and the concentration of the proteins.\nSOLUTION: The efferent arteriole is the arteriole that carries blood away from the glomerulus. The efferent arteriole is constricted by the vascular clamp. The constriction of the efferent arteriole decreases the volume of the glomerular filtration space. So, the Kf decreases."}

The optic nerve is made up of many nerve fibers that carry visual information from the retina, a layer of light-sensitive cells in the eye.\nThe optic nerve has two branches. One branch goes to the superior temporal area of the brain. The other branch goes to the inferior temporal area of the brain.\nThe superior branch carries information from the superior part of the retina. The inferior branch carries information from the inferior part of the retina.\nSOLUTION: The patient's symptoms are most likely a result of demyelination of the optic nerve. Myelination is the process by which nerve fibers are covered with a fatty substance called myelin. This process helps nerve fibers conduct impulses more efficiently.\nDemyelination is the loss of myelin. Myelin is essential for the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Loss of myelin causes nerve impulses to be slowed or blocked.\nDemyelination can be caused by multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the myelin on nerve fibers. When myelin is attacked, nerve impulses are slowed or blocked. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including visual loss."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The karyotype obtained from the patient's amniotic fluid sample shows that the fetus is XY. This means the fetus has a genotype of XY for the sex chromosome.\nHumans have X and Y sex chromosomes. The X and Y chromosomes are called alleles for the sex chromosome.\nAn organism's genotype for the sex chromosome is its combination of X and Y alleles. So, a human may have a genotype of XX, XY, or YY for the sex chromosome.\nA human with two X alleles is homozygous for the sex chromosome. A human with two Y alleles is homozygous for the sex chromosome.\nA human with one X allele and one Y allele is heterozygous for the sex chromosome.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. In humans, the presence of X alleles causes female sexual development. The presence of Y alleles causes male sexual development.\nAn organism with two X alleles will have the female phenotype. A human with the genotype XX will have female sexual development.\nAn organism with two Y alleles will have the male phenotype. A human with the genotype YY will have male sexual development.\nAn organism with one X allele and one Y allele will have the male phenotype. A human with the gen"}

His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "G0"}, {"label": "B", "text": "G1"}, {"label": "C", "text": "G2"}, {"label": "D", "text": "M"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Cells have different phases, or stages, of the cell cycle. When cells are not dividing, they are in the G0 phase. Cells in the G1 phase are preparing to divide. Cells in the S phase are in the process of duplicating their genetic material. Cells in the G2 phase are completing their genetic duplication. Cells in the M phase are dividing.\nA cell cycle arrest can occur in any phase of the cell cycle. When a cell is arrested, it stops dividing and goes into a resting state.\nCell cycle arrest can be caused by external signals or by genetic changes such as mutations. For example, cells may be arrested in the G1 phase in response to a lack of nutrients. Cells with a mutated p53 gene may be arrested in the G1 phase because the p53 gene is usually involved in activating cells to enter the S phase.\nSOLUTION: The p53 gene is involved in regulating cell cycle progression by controlling when cells enter the S phase. A mutation in the p53 gene can prevent cells from entering the S phase and can cause cells to continue to grow and divide.\nSince the man's tumor cells have a mutated p53 gene, the cells are unable to be arrested in the G1 phase. This mutation allows the tumor cells to progress through the cell cycle and to increase in size despite radiation therapy."}

As the heart beats and blood is pumped through the blood vessels, blood pressure increases. Blood pressure is a measure of the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels.\nBlood pressure is a result of stroke volume and peripheral resistance. Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart in one beat, and peripheral resistance is the amount of resistance in the peripheral, or distant, vessels.\nStroke volume and peripheral resistance each have a different effect on blood pressure. Stroke volume tends to increase blood pressure, while peripheral resistance tends to decrease blood pressure.\nSo, when stroke volume is greater and peripheral resistance is less, blood pressure is at its highest. This happens during exercise, when the heart beats faster and pumps more blood with each beat.\nSOLUTION: During the last minute of exercise, various measurements are taken. Compared with the measurement before the session, which of the following is most likely to be decreased?\nThe pulse is taken by feeling the pulse at the wrist. The pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures.\nThe systolic blood pressure is the pressure when the heart is beating.

High blood pressure, or hypertension, can put a strain on your heart and damage your blood vessels.\nBlood pressure is a result of several forces, including the amount of blood in your arteries and the strength of the heart's contractions. The amount of blood in your arteries depends on cardiac output, and the resistance in your peripheral arteries determines the pressure within them.\nCardiac output is a measure of the volume of blood your heart pumps in a minute. Your heart pumps more blood when it beats faster. Your heart rate can increase in response to stress or when you exercise.\nStroke volume is the volume of blood your heart pumps in a single beat. Your stroke volume usually decreases as you get older.\nExercise can increase stroke volume in young people, but it does not have as much effect in older people.\nPeripheral vascular resistance is the resistance that your peripheral arteries offer to blood flow. Peripheral vascular resistance is a function of the resistance in your arterioles and the amount of blood in your capillaries.\nThe volume of blood in your capillaries depends on the volume of blood in your arterioles. As your heart rate increases, your arterioles fill with more blood.

The heart pumps blood through the blood vessels.\nThe blood vessels are made up of arteries and veins. Arteries carry blood away from the heart. Veins bring blood to the heart.\nWhen the heart pumps blood into the arteries, the pressure of the blood is higher than the pressure in the veins. This pressure difference causes blood to flow from the arteries to the veins.\nThe flow of blood between the arteries and the veins is called the circulation of the blood.\nSOLUTION: The heart murmur is caused by abnormal blood flow across the heart. The abnormal blood flow creates an extra sound, or murmur.\nThe patient's medical history of intravenous drug use suggests that her heart murmur may be caused by damaged heart valves. The damaged valves may not close properly, allowing blood to flow the wrong way.\nThe extra sound of the blood flowing the wrong way between the heart's chambers is called a mitral valve murmur. This type of murmur is heard in the mitral valve area.\nThe medical term for a heart murmur that is increased with deep inspiration is a holosystolic murmur."}
