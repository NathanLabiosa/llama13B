It is formed by two bilateralsymphses, or sides.\nThe mandible is formed during development. The bone begins to form in the head at about 6 weeks I.U.L. The bone then grows and moves down to its adult position.\nThe mandible is the bottom bone of the face. It forms a lower jaw, which is attached to the skull by a joint. The joint allows the jaw to move up and down when you eat.\nThe angles of the mandible are the corners of the jaw. The angle is on the inside of the mandible.

As food moves through the digestive system, it is broken down into smaller particles of fat, protein, sugar, and other nutrients.\nThe digestive system also helps to remove waste from the body. Waste comes from the normal breakdown of food and from the normal functioning of the body's cells.\nWhen you swallow food, it travels down the esophagus and into the stomach. The stomach digests food using acids and enzymes. The stomach also churns, or mixes, the food and acid.\nThe small intestine is a long tube that is connected to the stomach. The small intestine is where most nutrients are absorbed from the food. The nutrients pass through the walls of the small intestine and into the blood. The blood carries the nutrients to different parts of the body.\nThe large intestine is a shorter tube that receives the remaining waste and water from the food. The large intestine absorbs water and nutrients from the waste. The feces, or solid waste, is then stored in the rectum until it is expelled from the body.\nSOLUTION: During swallowing, food passes from the pharynx into the esophagus. The epiglottis is a flap located above the larynx. When you swallow, the epiglottis moves down to cover the larynx. This prevents food from entering the larynx.\nThe larynx is located just below the epiglottis. It is made of muscles and cartilage. The larynx has several functions.

Some of these functions include:\nRegulating heart rate and blood pressure.\nControlling breathing.\nRegulating alertness.\nCoordinating the bodys movements.\nProcessing sensory information, such as touch and sound.\nThe brain stem uses specific pathways, or neural pathways, to transmit information. These pathways are made up of nerve cells, or neurons, that carry electrical signals from one part of the brain to another.\nSome pathways in the brain stem cross over from one side of the brain to the other. These are called decussation. For example, the pyramids are crossed by a pathway for discriminative touch.

For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.\nThe symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.\nThe symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.\nThe chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom.

The hypoglossal nerve controls the muscles of the tongue.\nThe glossopharyngeal nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve has two branches: the supraorbital nerve, which goes to the scalp and forehead, and the glossopharyngeal nerve proper, which goes to the back of the throat and the base of the tongue.\nThe lingual nerve is a branch of the mandibular nerve. The lingual nerve has two branches: the lingual nerve proper, which goes to the underside of the tongue, and the chorda tympani nerve, which goes to the tympanic part of the tongue.\nThe facial nerve is a branch of the seventh cranial nerve. The facial nerve has three branches: the temporal branch, which goes to the ear, the mandibular branch, which goes to the jaw and lip, and the facial branch, which goes to the muscles of the face.\nSOLUTION: Loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue indicates damage to the lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve. The lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve goes to the underside of the tongue."}

The doctor can use a cotton swab to collect a specimen from the anus.\nBladder: The bladder is a balloon-like organ that holds urine. To collect a urine specimen, the doctor will ask you to clean the area around your urinary opening and collect a clean catch specimen.\nUrethra: The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The doctor can use a cotton swab to collect a specimen from the urethra.\nTesticle: The testicles are male reproductive organs that produce sperm. A testicle specimen is collected by placing a small container around the testicle."}

A panoramic radiograph shows the mandibular canal.\nA maxillary sinus is also visible on a panoramic radiograph.\nA maxillary sinus is a hollow space in the bone of the face. A panoramic radiograph shows the maxillary sinus.\nA mandibular canal and a maxillary sinus are both visible on a panoramic radiograph.\nA mandibular canal and a maxillary sinus are both structures in the bone of the face. A panoramic radiograph shows both of these structures.\nA mandibular canal, a maxillary sinus, a hard palate, and a zygomatic arch are all visible on a panoramic radiograph.\nA mandibular canal, a maxillary sinus, a hard palate, and a zygomatic arch are all structures in the head. A panoramic radiograph shows all of these structures."}
