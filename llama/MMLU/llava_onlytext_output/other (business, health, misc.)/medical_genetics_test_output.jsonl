Some traits, such as eye color, are passed down through families as an autosomal trait. These traits are not linked to a specific sex chromosome.\nOther traits, such as hemophilia, are passed down through families as X-linked traits. Hemophilia is linked to the X chromosome. Because females have two X chromosomes, hemophilia can be passed down through families in one of two ways: as an X-linked dominant trait or as an X-linked recessive trait. Males have one X chromosome and cannot be affected by X-linked recessive traits.\nStill, other traits, such as color vision, are passed down through families as Y-linked traits. Color vision is linked to the Y chromosome. Males have one Y chromosome and will inherit a Y-linked trait from their fathers. Females have two X chromosomes and will inherit a Y-linked trait from their fathers if their father has the trait.\nA trait can also be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. An autosomal recessive trait is passed down through families as an allele, or form, of the trait. An organism has two alleles for each trait, one allele inherited from each parent. An organism's genotype for a trait is its combination of alleles. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of alleles and the organism's combination of alleles.\nAn organism with two alleles of the same type for a trait is called homozygous for that allele. An organism with two different alleles for a trait is called heterozygous for that allele.\nAn organism with at least one allele of the homozygous type for a trait is called homozygous for that allele.

This technique is based on the idea that different genes have different effects on a trait. For some traits, many genes are involved, and each gene has a different effect. The effects of these genes are added together to determine the organism's phenotype for the trait.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. A gene's effect on a trait is called its allele. An organism's alleles for a gene are called its genotype for that gene. An organism's combination of alleles for a gene is called its genotype for that gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of alleles. So, an organism's phenotype for a trait is its genotype for that trait.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is determined by its combination of alleles for that gene. An organism has two alleles for each gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is determined by its combination of alleles. An organism may have different alleles for a gene. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The types of alleles are called allelic types.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of allelic types. So, an organism's genotype for a gene is either homozygous or heterozygous.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that allele. An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that allele.\nSome alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different allelic types to have different phenotypes. For example, the flower color gene in pea plants has two possible alleles. One allele is for purple flowers, and the other is for white flowers. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The F allele is for purple flowers, and the f allele is for white flowers.\nThis allele is dominant over the f allele. An organism with at least one F allele will have the F allele's phenotype. So, an organism with at least one F allele will have purple flowers. An organism with only f alleles will have the f allele's phenotype. So, an organism with only f alleles will have white flowers.\nSome alleles are not dominant or recessive. These alleles are called co-dominant. The types of alleles in a gene determine an organism's phenotype.\nQTL analysis is used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross. A genetic cross is a cross between two organisms that have different alleles for a gene.\nTo do a QTL analysis, researchers first identify the alleles in the organisms used in the cross. Then, they examine how the different allelic types affect the trait. This analysis can show which chromosome regions contain QTLs for the trait.\nQTLs are genetic regions that contain alleles that affect a trait. So, a QTL is a location on a chromosome where a gene or part of a gene is found.\nSome QTLs contain genes that have effects on the trait. These genes are called functional QTLs. Other QTLs do not contain any genes that have effects on the trait. These QTLs are called nonfunctional QTLs."}

In this process, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell is turned off. This process helps to ensure that each cell has a single, complete copy of the X chromosome.\nFemale mammals have two X chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. But because females do not need an X chromosome for reproduction, one of the X chromosomes in each female cell is turned off. This process is called X-chromosome inactivation.\nX-chromosome inactivation is controlled by the parent with the chromosome that will be kept active. This process happens randomly during embryonic development. As a result, each cell of a female has a random mixture of active X chromosomes.\nFor most cells, the inactive X chromosome is marked by a special protein, called a heterochromatin.

A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The pattern of inheritance for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is X-linked recessive. This means that the gene for G6PD deficiency is located on the X chromosome, and that the recessive allele for this gene is responsible for the deficiency.\nThe X chromosome is one of the two chromosomes that people have in each cell. The X chromosome is marked X and the other chromosome is marked Y.\nFemale people have two X chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. Male people have one X chromosome inherited from their mother and one Y chromosome inherited from their father.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A female with two X alleles for G6PD is homozygous for the G6PD gene. These females have G6PD deficiency.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A female with one X and one Y allele for G6PD is heterozygous for the G6PD gene. These females have normal G6PD levels.\nA male with one X allele for G6PD is homozygous for the G6PD gene. These males have G6PD deficiency.\nA male with no alleles for G6PD is"}

Individuals with this genetic disorder have high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in their blood. LDL cholesterol is often called \"bad\" cholesterol because it can build up in the arteries and increase the risk of heart disease.\nThe liver uses HMG-CoA reductase to produce cholesterol. This enzyme also converts low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein. High density lipoprotein is often called \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a child with the disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene mutation from a parent with the mutation.\nSOLUTION: An organism's genes contain the instructions for building the parts of its cells. Genes may have mutations, or changes, that can cause diseases. A mutation in the gene that encodes HMG-CoA reductase causes familial hypercholesterolaemia.\nThe mutation prevents the liver from producing and processing cholesterol and other substances that help regulate blood cholesterol levels.

Some genetic conditions increase the risk of cancer. A family with a genetic cancer syndrome has a higher-than-average chance of developing cancer.\nA person with a genetic cancer syndrome does not always get cancer. But he or she has a higher-than-average chance of developing cancer. So, it is important for people with a genetic cancer syndrome to have regular cancer screenings.\nSome genetic cancer syndromes are caused by changes in genes that are passed down through families. Other syndromes are caused by inherited mutations. Mutations can occur for no apparent reason.\nHow are genetic cancer syndromes inherited?\nGenes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of an inherited trait. For example, flower color is an inherited trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for this gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. An organism's genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of an observable trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for this gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Waardenburg syndrome is not a familial cancer syndrome. Waardenburg syndrome is a dominant genetic disorder that can cause medical problems, including blue eyes and hearing loss. But Waardenburg syndrome is not a cancer syndrome.\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome are familial cancer syndromes."}

A female is heterozygous for an X-linked allele if the female has one copy of the allele.\nA male is homozygous for an X-linked allele if the male has two copies of the allele. Since males have only one X chromosome, males cannot be heterozygous for an X-linked allele.\nThe expected incidence of affected homozygous females is the incidence of females who are homozygous for the X-linked allele.

For example, in mammals, the gene for hair color is located on the X chromosome. The gene has two possible alleles. One allele is represented by an uppercase letter, and the other is represented by a lowercase letter. An organism with at least one uppercase allele for the hair color gene will have a dominant trait: fur.

An organism with only lowercase alleles for an X-linked dominant gene will have the recessive trait.\nSOLUTION: X-linked dominant inheritance is transmitted by males to females.\nAn X-linked dominant gene is located on the X chromosome. A male has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. A female has two X chromosomes.\nWhen a father passes an X-linked dominant gene to his offspring, it is transmitted in the same way as a Y-linked gene.

The recognition sequence for a restriction enzyme is the sequence of bases that the enzyme recognizes and cuts. Most restriction enzymes have a recognition sequence of 4 to 8 bases.\nSOLUTION: To calculate the average number of fragments into which a restriction enzyme will cleave a DNA molecule, multiply the size of the DNA molecule by the number of cuts the enzyme makes per base pair.\nThis number is called the enzyme's cutting efficiency. The cutting efficiency of a restriction enzyme is usually between 1 and 4 cuts per 1000 base pairs.\nSo, a restriction enzyme with a cutting efficiency of 2 cuts per 1000 base pairs would cut an average of 2 fragments into a 5000 bp DNA molecule."}

When a repressor protein is bound to its target DNA, it prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes located downstream of the DNA.\nThe lactose repressor of E. coli is a protein that binds to the lac operator sequence. The lac operator is located just upstream of the lac genes, which are involved in the breakdown of lactose.\nWhen lactose is present, its breakdown product, allolactose, is produced. Allolactose enters the cell and binds to the lac repressor. The bound allolactose prevents the lac repressor from binding to the lac operator.

One of these fields is genetics, the study of heredity. Offspring receive their genes, or hereditary material, from their parents. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSOLUTION: The statement about RET is a major susceptibility gene is incorrect. This statement is incorrect because the genetic region associated with Hirschsprung disease is not a major susceptibility gene. A major susceptibility gene is a gene that significantly increases an organism's risk of developing a disease."}

These differences are called congenital anomalies. A baby with a congenital anomaly is born with the condition.\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are small glands located near the kidneys. In a male, the adrenal glands make androgens and other hormones. In a female, the adrenal glands make androgens and estrogens.\nIn congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the adrenal glands make more androgens than normal. This can cause the appearance of a female baby to be more masculine. For example, the baby's genitals may appear to be normal, but the skin around the genitals may be rough. Or, the baby may have a clitoris that is larger than normal.\nCampomelic dysplasia is a genetic disorder that affects the formation of bones in the arms and legs. Many babies with campomelic dysplasia also have other problems, such as heart and kidney problems.\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia and campomelic dysplasia are both caused by changes in the genes.\nKlinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder in which a male is born with an extra X chromosome. Extra genes from the X chromosome can cause the baby to have female-like reproductive organs and other problems.\nAndrogen insensitivity is a genetic disorder in which a baby's body does not respond to androgens. Androgens are male hormones. In a female baby, the lack of androgen response can cause the appearance of a male, with a large clitoris and a urethra that opens at the bottom. In a male baby, the lack of androgen response can cause the appearance of a female, with a small penis and a urethra that opens at the bottom.\nSOLUTION: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Klinefelter syndrome are both caused by changes in the genes.

It is caused by a missing enzyme that helps break down proteins from certain foods. These proteins, called amino acids, are important for the body to grow and work properly.\nIf a person is missing OTC, their body cannot break down amino acids called arginine, citrulline, and ornithine. These amino acids then build up in the body, leading to problems such as damage to the liver, spleen, and brain.\nSOLUTION: A high blood ammonia level occurs in OTC deficiency.\nBecause OTC deficiency is caused by a missing enzyme, the body has trouble breaking down amino acids. These amino acids then break down into a substance called ammonia. Too much ammonia in the blood can reach toxic levels and cause problems throughout the body."}
