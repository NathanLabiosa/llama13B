{"question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "164%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1.64%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "0.45%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "183%"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: When you calculate a yield, you are determining how much money you will make from an investment.\nTo calculate the yield on an investment, follow these steps:\n1. Determine the total amount of money that you spent on the investment. This includes the cost of any goods or services that you had to buy to make the investment.\nIn this case, the limousine cost $98,000.\n2. Determine the amount of money that the investment is expected to earn. This is the amount of money that the investment will make for you.\nIn this case, the limousine is expected to be rented for 2 hours a day, and the rate is $245 per hour. So, the investment is expected to earn $245 x 2 = $490 per day.\n3. Calculate the yield. To do this, divide the amount of money that the investment is expected to earn by the total amount of money that you spent on the investment.\nThe yield is $490 per day / $98,000 = 0.05 or 5%."}

Assets are what a company owns. Liabilities are what a company owes. Equity is the value of the company that belongs to its owners.\nA company's balance sheet has two sides: the assets side and the liabilities and equity side.\nThe assets side lists a company's assets in order of their expected conversion to cash. This means that the assets that are most likely to be converted to cash are listed first, and the assets that are least likely to be converted to cash are listed last.\nThe liabilities and equity side lists a company's liabilities and equity in order of their due dates. This means that the liabilities that are due first are listed first, and the equity that is due to owners are listed last.\nSOLUTION: The omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise had an effect on Arno's balance sheet at year end. The merchandise should have been reported as both an asset and a liability. This would have understated the assets and liabilities on Arno's balance sheet."}

Nonsampling risk is the risk that a judgment is incorrect for reasons unrelated to the use of a sample.\nNonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. For example, an auditor may fail to recognize that a misstatement is present because he or she is inexperienced with a particular type of transaction.\nNonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. For example, an auditor may conclude that there are no misstatements in a population column if the sample column shows no misstatements.\nSampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.

The extra money is considered a premium, and it is shown on the bond's face. The following year, the company must amortize, or write off, the premium. This means that the company uses the premium to offset interest costs over the bond's life.\nThe effective interest method is used to amortize the premium. This method takes into account the fact that the company is using the premium to offset interest costs. So, the effective interest rate is used to calculate the amortized premium. The following formula is used:\nPremium amortization = ((Face value \u00d7 effective interest rate) - Face value) / life of the bond\nThe effective interest rate is the interest rate that reflects the bond's premium. It is calculated as follows:\nEffective interest rate = (1 + premium rate) / (1 - premium rate)\nThe premium rate is the ratio of the premium to the face value of the bond.\nFor example, if the premium is 3% of the face value, the premium rate is 3%.\nThe effective interest rate is 3.02% in this case.\nThe following table shows how the bond carrying value and earnings are affected by the error.\nIf Dean used the effective interest method, the bond carrying value and earnings would not be affected.\nThe carrying value is the asset's current value.\nThe earnings are the amount of money that the company has made or lost on the asset.\nIf Dean used the straight-line method, the bond carrying value would be overstated. The earnings would be understated.\nThe carrying value is overstated because the bond is not being amortized properly.\nThe earnings are understated because the bond is not accruing interest at the correct rate.\nThe bond carrying value is overstated, and there is no effect on earnings."}

Then, it can distribute those funds as dividends to its shareholders. The shareholders must report the dividends as income on their individual tax returns.\n2. If the corporation is an S corporation, it does not pay tax on its income. Instead, the corporation's income, deductions, and credit passes through to its shareholders.

But if you have $25,000 or more of adjusted gross income from other sources, you can deduct no more than $25,000 of the rental losses against that income. If your adjusted gross income is less than $25,000, you can deduct the total rental losses against that income. The remaining rental losses, if any, can be deducted against income from other sources.\nFor example, if you have an adjusted gross income of $30,000 and $15,000 of rental losses, you can deduct the $15,000 of losses against the $30,000 of adjusted gross income. This leaves you with $15,000 of taxable income.\nIf you have more rental losses than you have adjusted gross income from other sources, you can deduct the losses from prior years that were not previously applied against income. You can use losses from rental real estate activities to offset income from other rental real estate activities.\nYou cannot use rental losses to offset other income, such as wages or interest income.\nSOLUTION: To determine the amount of the rental losses that Smith can deduct, consider the following steps:\nStep 1: Smith's adjusted gross income is $120,000.\nStep 2: Smith's rental losses are $40,000.\nStep 3: $40,000 of rental losses exceeds Smith's adjusted gross income from other sources by $15,000.

A government's budget includes funds that are dedicated to specific purposes, such as streets, sidewalks, and bridges.\nA permanent fund is a type of dedicated fund. A dedicated fund is a type of fund that uses its resources for a specific purpose. A government may use a permanent fund to save money for future generations.\nSOLUTION: To report the expenditures, the city should use a debt service fund. The debt service fund is a dedicated fund that is used to manage the city's debt service expenditures.\nThe city's payment of $20,000 principal and $5,000 interest on its outstanding general obligation bonds is a debt service expenditure. The expenditure should be reported in the debt service fund."}

This difference is measured in today's dollars.\nIf the expected future value is greater than the cost, the NPV is positive. The investment is worth considering.\nIf the cost is greater than the expected future value, the NPV is negative. The investment is not worth considering.\nThe NPV equals the expected future value minus the cost. To determine the NPV, you need to determine what the investment is worth in the future and what it will cost today.\nSOLUTION: The investment is expected to deliver $2 million in five years. If the discount rate is 10%, the present value of that amount is $2 million / 1.10 = $181,818.\nThe investment will cost $1 million. The present cost of that amount is $1 million / 0.90 = $1,111,111.\nThe NPV of the investment is $181,818 - $1,111,111 = $242,000."}

An operating lease is a lease in which the lessee does not have the option to buy the property at the end of the lease term.\nA company may decide to lease property because it is usually cheaper than buying property. And for many businesses, leasing is a good choice. Leasing can free up cash, avoid maintenance and repair responsibilities, and allow a company to get the property it needs without the expense and risk of owning it.\nA lease is based on a contract. The contract sets the terms of the lease, including the length of the lease, the amount of the rental payments, and any conditions related to the lease.\nA lease has two parts. The lease term is the length of the lease. The rental payment is the amount the lessee pays to the lessor for the right to use the property.\nThe recognition of rental expense is the recording of the lease rental payment as an expense in the lessee's accounting system. The recognition of rental expense happens in the month that the lease term starts.\nSOLUTION: The lease term starts when the lessee receives control of the property and begins to use the property. In this case, the lessee begins alterations to the property on March 1 and moves into the property on May 1. May is the first month of the lease term, so the recognition of rental expense should begin in May."}

The balance sheet is balanced, which means that the total of assets must equal the total of liabilities and equity.\nAssets are what a company owns. An asset is either a long-term asset or a current asset.\nLong-term assets are assets that a company expects to keep for more than one year.\nCurrent assets are assets that a company expects to turn into cash within one year.\nLiabilities are what a company owes. A liability is either a long-term liability or a current liability.\nLong-term liabilities are debts that a company has that are not due for more than one year.\nCurrent liabilities are debts that a company has that are due within one year.\nEquity is the value of a company's assets that are left over after its liabilities are paid.\nThe balance sheet can be used to determine a company's solvency. Solvency is a measure of a company's ability to pay its debts. If a company has more assets than liabilities, it is solvent. If a company has more liabilities than assets, it is insolvent.\nSOLUTION: To classify the company's debt, look at the notes and the balloon note. The notes are due in five annual installments and the balloon note is due in three years. So, the debt is long-term.\nThe other liability is a line of credit. Because the line of credit is due in one year, it is a current liability.\nThe company's debt can be classified as current liabilities of $500,000 and long-term liabilities of $1,050,000."}

The stock price may be higher or lower than the market price for a given stock. The market price is the stock's current selling price. The market price for a stock may be higher than the stock's intrinsic value, in which case the stock is considered to be overvalued. Or, the market price may be lower than the stock's intrinsic value, in which case the stock is considered to be undervalued.\nThe intrinsic value of a stock is its true value.

The framework is composed of five interrelated components: the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.\nThe control environment refers to the overall tone of the organization, which is established by its leaders. The control environment sets the stage for all other components of internal control.\nRisk assessment is the process of identifying risks to the achievement of the organization's objectives and evaluating those risks based on their likelihood and potential impact.\nControl activities are the policies and procedures that help ensure that the organization's objectives will be achieved. These activities may include controls over the organization's people, processes, and systems.\nInformation and communication are the processes that the organization uses to identify, capture, and exchange information with people inside and outside the organization.\nMonitoring is the process of assessing the effectiveness of the organization's internal controls. This component of the framework includes ongoing monitoring activities, such as monitoring performance, reviewing reports, and evaluating the adequacy of controls.\nSOLUTION: The COSO Framework states that monitoring is designed to ensure that internal controls continue to operate effectively. When internal controls are in place, they help the organization achieve its objectives. But the internal controls can only do this if they are operating effectively. So, to achieve this, the organization must monitor the internal controls."}

The costs of business-type activities are borne by the customers.\nThe statement of activities reports the total costs of governmental and business-type activities for a government.\nA government should use the following steps to prepare its statement of activities:\n1. Determine which activities are governmental and which are business-type.\nPrograms that provide services to the government's residents are considered governmental. Business-type activities include activities that provide goods and services to the government's customers.\n2. Determine which costs are assigned to governmental and business-type activities.\nThis assignment is made in a separate statement called the allocation of costs to governmental and business-type activities. The costs of the government's general government functions are considered in this allocation. General government functions include all activities that are not specific to one service or program.\n3.

The WACC is calculated by taking into account the proportion of the company's capital that is financed by different sources of funds.\nThe capital structure of a company is shown in its balance sheet. The balance sheet shows a company's assets, liabilities, and equity. Assets are what a company owns. Liabilities are what a company owes. Equity is a company's net worth, which is its assets minus its liabilities.\nThe WACC is calculated as follows:\nWACC = (E/V) \u00d7 (Kd \u00d7 (1 - T) + Ke \u00d7 T)\nwhere E is the size of the company's equity; V is the market value of the company's debt and equity; Kd is the cost of debt; Ke is the cost of equity; and T is the company's tax rate.\nSOLUTION: First, calculate the market value of the company's debt and equity. The debt is 80% of the capital structure, or 80% of the company's value. The equity is 20% of the capital structure, or 20% of the company's value.\nSo, the market value of the company's debt and equity is 80% of the company's value plus 20% of the company's value. This is 100% of the company's value.\nNext, calculate the WACC. The cost of debt is 5%, or 0.05. The cost of equity is 10%, or 0.10. The tax rate is 21%, or 0.21.\nThe WACC is (20% \u00d7 0.05 + 80% \u00d7 0.10 + 0% \u00d7 0.21) = 6.00%."}

The risk is assessed based on the likelihood that a material misstatement will not be detected by the control. A material misstatement is a misstatement that could influence the economic decision-making of users of the financial statements.\nThe auditor's assessment of the risk of material misstatement is based on the control's nature, the potential consequences of a control breakdown, and the rate of deviation from the control. The tolerable rate of deviations from a test of controls is the highest rate of deviation that the auditor considers to be acceptable.\nIn assessing the tolerable rate of deviations from a test of controls, the auditor should consider the following factors:\nThe degree of assurance desired in the financial statements.\nThe nature of the control and the account or assertion being controlled.\nThe impact of the control on the financial statements.\nThe risk that the control will fail to operate as planned.\nThe rate of deviation from the control.\nThe above factors are not equally important. For example, the degree of assurance desired in the financial statements is more important than the rate of deviation from the control.\nSOLUTION: The auditor should consider the rate of deviation from the control. Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate. This means that the auditor would find a lower rate of misstatements if the auditor were to allow for a higher rate of deviations from the controls."}

A beta greater than 1 indicates that the stock's price will be more volatile than the market index. A beta less than 1 indicates that the stock's price will be less volatile than the market index.\nBeta can be used to calculate the expected risks and returns of a stock. The expected return of a stock with a beta of 1 is the return of the market index. The expected risk of a stock with a beta of 1 is the risk of the market index.\nIf a stock's beta is greater than 1, its expected return will be greater than the return of the market index. Its expected risk will also be greater than the risk of the market index.\nIf a stock's beta is less than 1, its expected return will be less than the return of the market index. Its expected risk will also be less than the risk of the market index.\nSOLUTION: The beta of Stock A is 0.24.\nThe covariance of Stock A and the market index is positive, and their standard deviations are not equal. So, the beta of Stock A must be less than 1."}

Account confirmation is a request to a bank, customer, or other third party to verify the accuracy of an account. The auditor can compare the confirmation to the account's records to determine if they are consistent.\nAn auditor may use a positive or negative confirmation:\nA positive confirmation is a request to the bank, customer, or third party to confirm that the amount shown in the account is correct.\nA negative confirmation is a request to the bank, customer, or third party to confirm that the amount shown in the account is incorrect.\nAn auditor may use a blank form confirmation, which requests the other party to provide the current balance of the account, or an alternative form confirmation, which asks the other party to verify a specific transaction that appears on the account.\nSOLUTION: The blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation may be ineffective because all accounts do not have an equal opportunity to be selected for confirmation.\nFor example, if the auditor only confirms accounts that are significantly large, few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients."}

They issue new shares of stock to shareholders. A 30% stock dividend means that for each share of stock a person owns, the corporation will give that person an additional 30% of a share.\nIf a person owns 100 shares of a stock, a 30% stock dividend means that the corporation will give that person an additional 30 shares of stock. So, the person will have a total of 100 + 30 = 130 shares of the stock.\nThe corporation will issue 30 shares of the stock for each 100 shares of the stock that the person owns.\nThe corporation records the stock dividend by debiting issued shares for the number of new shares issued. The corporation records the stock dividend by crediting additional paid-in capital for the value of the new shares.\nThe shareholder receives the stock dividend by receiving an additional 30% of a share for each share the shareholder owns. The shareholder records the stock dividend by debiting retained earnings for the value of the new shares.\nSOLUTION: The corporation will issue 30 shares of the stock for each 100 shares of the stock that the shareholders own. So, the corporation will issue 1,000 + 300 = $1,300 worth of additional shares.\nSince the corporation is issuing the shares, it debits issued shares for $1,300.\nThe value of the shares is debited to additional paid-in capital.

With accrual-based accounting, revenue is recorded when it is earned, and expenses are recorded when they are incurred. This method of accounting reflects the reality that some transactions take place in one period but are paid for in another period.\nFor example, if a company earns a lot of revenue in December but does not get paid until January, the revenue should be recorded in December, when it is earned. This is called accruing revenue.\nSimilarly, if a company incurs expenses in December but does not pay the invoice until January, the expenses should be recorded in December, when they are incurred. This is called accruing expenses.\nSOLUTION: To determine the amount that Lind Co. should report as salaries expense for the month ended June 30, you need to figure out how much salaries expense was incurred during June.\nThe company's accounting calendar is written with both a date and a amount. The date is the date the expense was incurred. The amount is the expense.\nFor example, June 18 is the date the last payroll was paid. The amount is $10,000. So, on June 18, the salaries expense was $10,000.\nThe company's accounting calendar is written with both a date and an amount. The date is the date the revenue or expense was incurred. The amount is the revenue or expense.\nJune 30 is the date the month-end balance was June 30. The amount is $14,000. So, on June 30, the salaries expense account had a balance of $14,000.\nSo, the amount that Lind Co. should report as salaries expense for the month ended June 30 is $14,000."}

Based upon the following table what action should Skytop take regarding acquisition of the machine and why? Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $1.464 Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $0.683 Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $4.641 Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $3.170 Acquire: Reason:", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes Net cash flow is $20000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yes Net future value is $36025"}, {"label": "C", "text": "No Net present value is ($750)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No Net present value is ($8750)"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A capital budgeting decision is a major investment that will benefit the business for many years. Some capital budgeting decisions involve long-term projects, such as building a new factory. Other capital budgeting decisions involve the acquisition of equipment or the purchase of a long-term investment, such as a 10-year bond.\nBefore deciding to acquire a long-term asset, a business must determine whether the asset's benefit will exceed its cost. To do this, a business can create a budget that shows the benefits and costs of the asset.\nA budget is a plan for how to spend money. A budget shows how much money is coming in and how much money is going out.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether Skytop Co. should acquire the machine, the company can create a budget that shows the benefits and costs of the asset.\nThe machine will produce uniform cash inflows of $25000 for four years. This means that the machine will increase Skytop Co.'s future cash flows by $25000.\nSkytop Co. evaluates capital projects using discounted cash flows. Discounted cash flows is a method of analyzing a capital budgeting decision. To use discounted cash flows to evaluate a project, you calculate the discounted value of the project's cash inflows and outflows.\nThe discounted value of cash inflows is equal to the present value of cash inflows. The present value of cash inflows is calculated as follows:\nPresent value of cash inflows = $25000 / (1 + 10%) = $25000 / 1.1 = $22,727.\nThe discounted value of cash outflows is equal to the present value of cash outflows. The present value of cash outflows is calculated as follows:\nPresent value of cash outflows = $80000 / (1 + 10%) = $80000 / 1.1 = $72,727.\nThe net present value of the machine is the discounted value of cash inflows minus the discounted value of cash outflows. The net present value is calculated as follows:\nNet present value = $22,727 - $72,727 = -$50,000.\nThe net present value is negative. This means that the machine's cost is greater than its benefit. So, Skytop Co. should not acquire the machine."}
{"question": "In return for a 20% partnership interest, Skinner contributed $5,000 cash and land with a $12,000 basis and a $20,000 fair market value to the partnership. The land was subject to a $10,000 mortgage that the partnership assumed.

It helps you determine your gain or loss when you sell an asset.\nYour basis in an asset must be in the asset to figure your gain or loss when you sell it. Your basis can be the amount you paid for the asset, or it can be the asset's fair market value at the time you acquired it.\nSOLUTION: To determine Skinner's basis in the partnership interest, you need to use the general formula:\nBasis = Skinner's investment in the partnership.\nSkinner's investment in the partnership is the cash and land he contributed to the partnership.\nThe land was subject to a $10,000 mortgage that the partnership assumed. This means that the land's liabilities exceeded its basis by $10,000. So, the land's basis is $12,000 ($10,000 for the mortgage and $2,000 for the land).\nThe partnership also had $20,000 in recourse liabilities. This means that the partners are liable for these debts. Because Skinner is a partner, he is also liable for his share of the recourse liabilities.\nSo, Skinner's basis in the partnership interest is $19,000. This is the amount he would have if he sold his share of the partnership's assets."}

A favorable variance is when actual costs are lower than budgeted costs. An unfavorable variance is when actual costs are higher than budgeted costs.\nWhat do these variances mean?\nThe labor rate variance is unfavorable. This means that the actual hours multiplied by the actual rate are higher than the budgeted hours multiplied by the budgeted rate.\nThe labor efficiency variance is unfavorable. This means that the actual number of hours worked is lower than the budgeted number of hours worked.\nThe unfavorable labor rate and labor efficiency variances add up to an unfavorable labor variance.\nWhat are the effects of writing the variances off directly to cost of goods sold?\nWhen a variance is written off directly to cost of goods sold, the variances are subtracted from cost of goods sold on the income statement. This reduces the net income.\nWhen the variances are written off, the balances in the work-in-process and finished-goods accounts are increased. This means that the cost of goods sold for the next period will be higher.\nWhat are the effects of allocating the variances to work in process and finished goods, and cost of goods sold?\nWhen variances are allocated to work in process and finished goods, the balances in these accounts are increased.
