The economy grows when the output of goods and services increases.\nThere are many ways to influence the economy's growth. For example, governments can design policies to alter the amount of money people spend.\nWhen the amount of money people spend increases, demand for goods and services increases. As a result of the increased demand, more resources are used to produce goods and services. The economy grows if it produces more goods and services with the extra resources.\nIf one part of the economy grows while another part does not, the economy's output will shift. For example, if most people in a country move from farming to working in factories, the economy will shift from being based on agriculture to being based on industry.\nSOLUTION: An expansionary fiscal policy is a set of government policies that involves increasing government spending or decreasing taxes. An expansionary fiscal policy increases aggregate demand for goods and services.\nThe fact that the price level increased only a small amount in response to the large increase in real output suggests that aggregate demand is steeply sloped. This means that, for each additional unit of output, businesses sell more goods and services. So, the increase in government spending caused the economy to grow."}

The two main tools of monetary policy are open market operations and the discount rate.\nOpen market operations are the Federal Reserve's main tool of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve uses open market operations to sell securities to the public. When it does, it pays for the securities by depositing money into the seller's bank account. This action increases the money supply.\nThe discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve can make it more expensive or less expensive to borrow money by raising or lowering the discount rate. If the discount rate goes up, other interest rates often go up as well.\nThe Federal Reserve uses expansionary monetary policy when it wants to increase the money supply and stimulate the economy. The Federal Reserve uses contractionary monetary policy when it wants to decrease the money supply and slow down the economy.\nA central bank is a bank that manages a country's money supply and interest rates. A central bank can use its control of the money supply and interest rates to help achieve certain economic goals.\nFor example, a central bank can use its tools to help reach goals such as low unemployment and low inflation.\nSOLUTION: Falling Treasury bond prices might be caused by expansionary monetary policy.

But if the retirement age is lowered, the quantity demanded will usually fall, ceteris paribus.\nSOLUTION: When the unemployment rate rises, potential GDP will fall, ceteris paribus. This is because the unemployment rate is a component of the inflation rate, and the inflation rate affects potential GDP. When more people are unemployed, the inflation rate rises, and potential GDP falls.\nMore immigration is allowed. Potential GDP will rise, ceteris paribus. This is because immigration increases the number of workers in an economy. This rise in the labor force leads to a rise in potential GDP.\nThe retirement age is lowered. Potential GDP will fall, ceteris paribus. This is because the retirement age is a component of the inflation rate, and the inflation rate affects potential GDP. When the retirement age is lowered, the inflation rate rises, and potential GDP falls.\nTariffs protecting domestic jobs are eliminated. Potential GDP will rise, ceteris paribus. Eliminating tariffs reduces the cost of goods for businesses and households. This reduction in costs leads to a rise in potential GDP."}

It shows the prices and quantities that equilibrium.\nWhen the price level changes, the equilibrium shifts. The new price level and quantity of output are found at the intersection of the price level axis and the aggregate supply curve.\nIf the price level increases, the equilibrium quantity of output supplied increases. The increase in the price level does not change the quantity of output that is supplied. The supply of output is the result of the choice of producers. Producers have a choice of how much to produce at a given price level. So, the supply of output is upward sloping.\nIf the price level decreases, the equilibrium quantity of output supplied decreases. The decrease in the price level causes producers to choose to supply less output. The supply of output is downward sloping.\nSOLUTION: A leftward shift of the aggregate supply curve means that the price level changes or the quantity of output changes.\nThe aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, so a decrease in the price level will cause the quantity of output to increase. So, the equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases."}

Summer and winter are the seasons of the year when many businesses are busiest. But during the transitions between seasons, some businesses have to lay off workers because customers spend less money during those periods.\nFrictional unemployment is caused by the normal turnover of workers and jobs. When a worker leaves a job, and a new worker is hired, some time usually passes before the new worker is fully trained and productive.

Instead, the price level changes in the opposite direction of the change in aggregate demand or aggregate supply.\nFor example, when aggregate demand increases, the price level rises, and when aggregate supply increases, the price level falls.\nWhen the price level changes, the economy is in a state of price-level adjustment. In the short run, the economy does not change its overall price level, so the quantity of goods and services traded in the market is equal to the quantity of goods and services supplied by firms.\nIn the long run, the economy adjusts to changes in aggregate demand or aggregate supply by changing the quantity of goods and services produced and traded.\nSOLUTION: To close an expansionary gap, the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left. The price level falls, and the quantity of goods and services traded in the market is equal to the quantity of goods and services supplied by firms."}

It is downward-sloping, which means that when the price firms receive for their output decreases, the quantity of output that they sell decreases.\nThere are many reasons why the price of output might decrease. For example, the price of the inputs used to produce output might decrease. Or, interest rates might decrease, which could increase the demand for the output.\nSOLUTION: A horizontal short-run aggregate supply curve occurs when the price of output stays the same while the quantity of output changes. This can happen when there are many unemployed resources so that output can be increased without increasing wages and prices.\nFor example, imagine that an increase in demand for a product increases the demand for the workers who make it. If most of the workers are already employed, the wages for these workers will increase. But if many of the workers are unemployed, the increase in demand will not cause wages to increase. In this case, the short-run aggregate supply curve for this product will be horizontal."}

It is important to understand the flow of goods and services into and out of a country.\nImports are goods and services that a country cannot produce for itself. So, to get the things it needs, a country must import them from other countries.\nExports are goods and services that a country produces. So, when a country sells its goods and services to other countries, it is exporting them.\nA trade deficit happens when a country imports more goods and services than it exports. An trade surplus happens when a country exports more goods and services than it imports.\nSOLUTION: The equation GDP = C + I + G + X tells you that GDP is the total of consumer spending, investments, government spending, and exports.\nLooking at the equation, you can see that exports are part of GDP. So, exports do not represent an equation.\nImports minus exports is the same as net exports. So, the correct answer is D."}

When inflation rises, the value of a dollar falls, and the purchasing power of a dollar falls. This means that you can buy fewer goods and services with a dollar than you could before.\nSOLUTION: In order to answer this question, you need to decide which part of the equation is most likely to contribute to stagflation.\nStagflation is a combination of inflation and economic stagnation. Stagnation refers to a situation in which the economy is not growing.\nConsider each part of the equation in turn:\nAD: The aggregate demand (AD) for a country's goods and services is the total amount of money that people are spending on those goods and services. If AD increases, the prices of goods and services tend to rise, and inflation tends to rise. So, if AD increases with constant SRAS, inflation tends to rise.\nSRAS: The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) is the total amount of goods and services that businesses produce and sell. The short-run refers to the part of the curve where firms are not able to increase the amount they produce and sell. If SRAS decreases, the prices of goods and services tend to rise, and inflation tends to rise. So, if SRAS decreases with constant AD, inflation tends to rise."}

When the discount rate is lowered, it costs banks less to borrow money, and they are likely to do so. Increasing the amount of bank credit available at a lower discount rate increases the money supply.\nBuy bonds: When the Fed buys bonds from banks, it is effectively printing money and putting it into circulation. Banks can now lend out more money, which increases the money supply.\nSell bonds: When the Fed sells bonds to the public, it is effectively taking money out of circulation. Banks have less money to lend, which decreases the money supply.\nRaise reserve requirements: Reserve requirements are the amounts of money that banks must hold in reserve. When reserve requirements are raised, banks have less money to lend. So, the money supply decreases.\nLower reserve requirements: Reserve requirements are the amounts of money that banks must hold in reserve. When reserve requirements are lowered, banks have more money to lend. So, the money supply increases."}

To see why, consider the effects of a decrease in the money supply on interest rates and spending.\nFirst, the decrease in the money supply lowers the money available for lending. Since lenders will now have less money to lend, they will raise the interest rate on loans to compensate for the lower yield. As a result, the interest rate will increase.\nHigher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing. So, to offset the higher interest rate, borrowers will need to lower their spending.

There is no central authority that determines the value of a currency.\nThe supply of a currency is called the money supply. The money supply is created by a country's central bank. The central bank can increase the money supply by printing more money.\nDemand for a currency is called the demand for the currency. The demand for a currency is determined by many factors, including interest rates, economic growth, and geopolitical events.\nWhen the demand for a currency is strong, its value will increase. When the demand for a currency is weak, its value will decrease.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether the value of a currency varies directly with the cost of living, look at the relationship between the two. The cost of living is the price of goods and services. As the cost of living increases, the demand for currency to buy these goods and services will increase. The value of the currency will increase.\nSo, the value of currency varies directly with the cost of living.\nTo determine whether the value of a currency is inversely related to the savings rate, look at the relationship between the two. The savings rate is the percentage of money that people save. When the savings rate increases, the demand for currency will decrease.

This happens because people want to hold on to their money. As a result, the price of goods and services also falls, as the velocity of money affects inflation.\nAs the demand for bonds increases, the interest rate on bonds increases. This is because people are willing to pay more for the security of a bond. When the interest rate on bonds increases, the interest rate on other financial assets, such as stocks and loans, also increases.\nWhen the demand for stocks and bonds increases, the price of these assets increases. This happens because the demand for these assets is greater than the supply of these assets. The increase in the price of these assets means that the asset demand for money falls.\nA macroeconomic recession decreases the demand for loanable funds. This happens because businesses and consumers have less money to borrow. As the demand for loanable funds falls, the interest rate on loanable funds increases."}

When the economy is operating beyond full employment, some increase in the number of workers is needed to produce more goods and services. The short-run aggregate supply curve is not a horizontal line, but it is flatter than the long-run aggregate supply curve. This means that an increase in aggregate demand will have a smaller increase in the price level.\nThe long-run aggregate supply curve is the part of the aggregate supply curve that shows the types of resources that are not fully employed. When the economy is operating beyond full employment, the long-run aggregate supply curve is not a horizontal line, but it is more vertical than the short-run aggregate supply curve. This means that an increase in aggregate demand will have a larger increase in the price level.\nSOLUTION: The first step is to determine which curve is affected by changes in aggregate demand when the economy is operating beyond full employment. The long-run aggregate supply curve is not affected by changes in aggregate demand when the economy is operating beyond full employment. The short-run aggregate supply curve is affected by changes in aggregate demand when the economy is operating beyond full employment.\nSo, further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation."}

One strategy you might use is dumping, or selling a product in a foreign market for a lower price than it is sold in your domestic market. For example, an American company might dump product in a foreign market by selling it for $10 per unit when it is sold for $20 per unit in the United States.\nDumping can be harmful to domestic companies in the foreign market. These companies must compete with the imported product, which is sold at a lower price. This can cause these companies to lose sales and, in turn, money.\nDumping is not a legal practice in many countries. In fact, many countries have laws against dumping. If a company is found to be dumping, the government of the foreign market may take action against the company.\nSOLUTION: A corporation may use the strategy of convincing its government to put an import tariff on the product. An import tariff is a tax on a product that is imported from another country.\nBy placing an import tariff on a product, the price of the imported product will increase. This will make the imported product more expensive than the domestic product. As a result, customers will be willing to pay more for the domestic product."}

When the government increases spending and reduces taxes, it is engaged in expansionary fiscal policy. When the government decreases spending and increases taxes, it is engaged in contractionary fiscal policy.\nThe following diagram shows how these policies affect the economy. When the government spends more money, that money is used to pay for goods and services. This increases the demand for those goods and services, which causes the price level to rise. The price level is the sum of all prices across the economy.\nAs the price level rises, the value of money falls. This is because there is more money chasing after the same amount of goods and services. When the value of money falls, each unit of money buys fewer goods and services.\nSo, when the government increases spending and reduces taxes, the demand for goods and services rises, and the price level increases. This is called inflation.\nWhen the government decreases spending and increases taxes, the demand for goods and services falls, and the price level decreases. This is called deflation.\nSOLUTION: To remedy a recession, the appropriate fiscal policy is to increase government spending and reduce taxes. This combination of policies increases the demand for goods and services, which leads to an increase in the price level.\nThe price level in the economy is already low. So, an increase in the price level, caused by the increase in demand for goods and services, is called inflation."}

The standard of living includes things like how long people live, how well they are able to support themselves, and what things cost. To have a high standard of living, a country needs to have high levels of productivity, or the amount of goods and services that people produce. Productivity is affected by the amount of capital per worker and how efficiently the capital is used.\nA country's capital includes its buildings, machines, and other tools. A country's capital per worker tells you the average amount of capital available to each worker. If a country has more capital per worker, then it has higher productivity, and its people can afford to buy more goods and services.\nThis graph shows how the standard of living in a country is affected by capital per worker.

One of the tools the Fed uses to set the interest rate is open-market operations. In open-market operations, the Fed buys and sells securities on the open market to change the money supply and the interest rate.\nWhen the Fed sells securities, it increases the money supply and decreases the interest rate. This is called an easy money policy. When the Fed buys securities, it decreases the money supply and increases the interest rate. This is called a tight money policy.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the nominal interest rate results from an easy money policy by the Fed. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate before adjusting for inflation. When the nominal interest rate increases, the interest rates for loans and investments also increase.\nThe other answers are not correct. An increase in net exports results from a tight money policy by the Fed. A tight money policy decreases the money supply and causes the exchange rate to increase. When the exchange rate increases, the prices of goods and services imported into the country decrease. As a result of the lower prices, the foreign buyers will buy more goods and services from the country.\nThe real interest rate is the interest rate adjusted for inflation.

If one of the components of national income\u2014consumer spending, investment spending, or government spending\u2014increases, the spending multiplier will increase.\nThe spending multiplier can increase in several ways. An increase in the marginal propensity to consume tends to increase the spending multiplier. The marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of an additional dollar of income that is spent. For example, if consumer spending increases by $1 for every additional $0.85 in income, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.85.\nAn increase in investment spending also increases the spending multiplier. Investment spending is a component of national income, and when it increases, the spending multiplier will increase.\nA decrease in the velocity of money tends to decrease the spending multiplier. The velocity of money is the ratio of the total amount of money spent to the total amount of money in circulation. If the velocity of money decreases, the spending multiplier will decrease.\nAn increase in the real interest rate tends to decrease the spending multiplier. When the real interest rate is higher, people are more likely to save, and that increases the amount of cash held by households. Because cash is a component of the money supply, an increase in cash holdings increases the money supply, leading to a decrease in the velocity of money. The decrease in the velocity of money means that the spending multiplier will decrease.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the marginal propensity to consume tends to increase the spending multiplier. The marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of an additional dollar of income that is spent. For example, if consumer spending increases by $1 for every additional $0.85 in income, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.85.\nAn increase in the marginal propensity to consume causes the spending multiplier to increase. Imagine that an increase in income of $100 leads to an additional $15 of consumption. The marginal propensity to consume is 0.15, or 15%. So, the spending multiplier is 15%.\nThe spending multiplier increases from 2 to 3."}

The crowding-out effect happens because the government and private businesses are both trying to borrow money from the same pool of lenders. When the government borrows more money, it drives up the interest rates that private businesses pay to borrow money. As a result, private businesses borrow less money, and the total amount of money invested in the economy decreases.\nSOLUTION: The crowding-out effect from government borrowing is best described as the leftward shift in AD in response to the rising interest rates from expansionary fiscal policy.\nWhen the government borrows more money, it drives up interest rates. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for private businesses. When the cost of borrowing increases, private businesses tend to borrow less money and invest less.

This formula shows that the money supply is equal to the quantity of money.\nThis formula has important implications. It means that the central bank can increase the money supply by increasing the quantity of money. For example, the central bank can print more money.\nThis increase in the money supply causes inflation if the increase exceeds the increase in the output of goods and services. The inflation occurs because there is more money looking for the same amount of goods and services.\nA change in the quantity of money is represented by the formula Q = Q + 50. This formula shows that the quantity of money can change, but the money supply is always equal to the quantity of money.\nThis formula has important implications. It means that the central bank can increase the money supply by increasing the quantity of money. For example, the central bank can print more money."}

When the government spends money or cuts taxes, it is using fiscal policy to stimulate the economy.\nThe government can use fiscal policy to counter a recession by increasing taxes and government spending. When the government collects more money through taxes and spends it on items such as food, clothing, and gasoline, it increases the demand for goods and services. As demand rises, firms will produce more, which will lead to higher levels of income and, in turn, more spending.\nThe government can also use fiscal policy to cool an overheating economy by decreasing taxes and government spending. When the government cuts taxes and spending, it decreases the demand for goods and services. As demand falls, firms produce and sell fewer goods and services, which leads to lower levels of income and spending."}
{"question": "Suppose that Tiger Woods buys a golf ball in England for $1 and the marginal propensity to consume in England is 0.75.

For example, if a person's MPC is 0.75, then they consume 75 cents of each additional dollar they earn.\nThe marginal propensity to consume is one way to describe how people spend their income. It is not the only way. Another way to describe how people spend their income is to describe their average propensity to consume, or APP. The APP is the proportion of each additional dollar of income that people consume. For example, if a person's APP is 0.75, then they consume 75 cents of each additional dollar they earn.\nThe marginal propensity to consume is related to the marginal propensity to save, or MPS. The MPS is the proportion of each additional dollar of income that people save. The MPC and MPS must add up to 1.\nSOLUTION: The marginal propensity to consume is 0.75. This means that people consume 75 cents of each additional dollar they earn.\nThe total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Mr. Woods' purchase is 1.25. This is the sum of the $1 that Mr. Woods spends and the $1.25 that the marginal propensity to consume adds to England's real GDP."}

The rise in the exchange rate will affect the prices of goods and services that are imported from Japan.\nIf the value of the dollar falls in terms of the yen, the exchange rate between the United States and Japan has fallen. The fall in the exchange rate will make goods and services that are imported from Japan cheaper for people in the United States to buy.\nSOLUTION: If interest rates rise in the United States relative to other nations then, the value of the dollar will tend to appreciate.\nThis effect is not based on the exchange rate but on the fact that interest rates affect the supply and demand for a currency.

When the government spends money or lowers taxes, it is engaging in expansionary fiscal policy. When the government cuts spending or raises taxes, it is engaging in contractionary fiscal policy.\nFiscal policy can affect the economy in the following ways:\nExplanation: Crowding out occurs when the government spends money or lowers taxes, and as a result, investors become less willing to invest in the economy. In response to crowding out, interest rates will rise, which will decrease investment and also increase the value of the currency.\nRational expectations is the assumption that people will change their behavior when they expect an event to happen. Rational expectations can be a barrier to the effectiveness of fiscal policy: if people expect a government's spending to be temporary, they will not change their behavior in response to the spending.\nThe balanced budget amendment is a proposal to require that the government balance its budget, spending no more money than it takes in. While a balanced budget amendment would force the government to save money, it could also lead to a situation where the government is not spending enough money to stimulate the economy.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C. Crowding out occurs when the government spends money or lowers taxes, and as a result, investors become less willing to invest in the economy. In response to crowding out, interest rates will rise, which will decrease investment and also increase the value of the currency."}

There are several reasons why the AS curve slopes upward:\nAs the price level goes up, firms can charge higher prices for their output. This means that firms will sell more output at each price level, so the quantity of output produced and sold will increase. This happens because the higher price leads to an increase in the supply of output.\nWhen the price level goes up, the cost of production also goes up. Firms must spread these higher costs over fewer units of output, so the price of output must go up. As a result of the higher price, both buyers and sellers will produce and sell fewer units of output. This happens because the higher price leads to a decrease in the demand for output.\nThe AS curve always slopes upward. This means that, in the long run, the price level always rises to clear the market.\nSOLUTION: The AS curve is always upward sloping because it follows the Law of Supply. When the price level goes up, the quantity of output that firms produce and sell also goes up. This happens because the higher price leads to an increase in the supply of output.

They collect money by selling goods and services to people and businesses. The supply of loanable funds is the amount of money that savers and investors have available to lend.\nThe supply of loanable funds can increase when savers have more money to invest or when investors have higher expected returns from their investments. The supply of loanable funds can decrease when savers have less money to invest or when investors have lower expected returns from their investments.\nSOLUTION: Investors are people and businesses that collect money by selling shares of a company. They use this money to start or grow a business.\nThe supply of loanable funds increases when investors have more money to invest. So, investors are a source of the supply of loanable funds."}
{"question": "Congress has embarked on another round of expansionary fiscal policy to boost employment and get reelected. As chair of the central bank how would you reduce the \"crowding-out\" effect and what macroeconomic problem might your policy exacerbate?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increase the reserve ratio risking the devaluation of the dollar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sell government securities risking inflation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Buy government securities risking a recessionary gap"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lower the discount rate risking inflation"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Central banks do not set the money supply. Instead, they manage the money supply to stabilize the economy. One way they do this is by setting the discount rate, which is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money.\nWhen the discount rate is low, the money supply increases. When the discount rate is high, the money supply decreases. The diagram below shows how the discount rate affects the money supply.\nIf the central bank wants to increase the money supply, it will lower the discount rate. This leads to more borrowing by banks and an increase in the money supply.\nIf the central bank wants to decrease the money supply, it will raise the discount rate. This leads to less borrowing by banks and a decrease in the money supply.\nSOLUTION: To reduce the crowding-out effect, the chair of the central bank can buy government securities. Doing so increases the money supply, which leads to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates, in turn, stimulate investment and consumption, which helps to reduce the crowding-out effect.\nBuying government securities does, however, risk a recessionary gap. A recessionary gap is the difference between the actual output of goods and services and the output that would occur if all assets were fully employed. When the central bank buys government securities, it increases the money supply, which leads to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates, however, can slow investment and consumption, which can cause a recessionary gap.\nIncreasing the reserve ratio, selling government securities, or raising the discount rate would all exacerbate the crowding-out effect. Increasing the reserve ratio and selling government securities would both decrease the money supply, which would increase interest rates. Higher interest rates would slow investment and consumption, which would exacerbate the crowding-out effect. Raising the discount rate would also increase interest rates, which would exacerbate the crowding-out effect."}

Exogenous variables are determined by external events and do not depend on the decisions of households and businesses. Exogenous variables include changes in government spending, taxes, and technology.\nEndogenous variables are determined by the decisions of households and businesses and depend on the decisions of other households and businesses. Endogenous variables include the level of demand for goods and services.\nSOLUTION: A change in government spending will have a greater short run impact on real output when the marginal propensity to consume is lower. The marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of each additional dollar of income that is spent. When consumption is a larger part of economic output, an increase in government spending will have a greater effect on real output.\nFor example, suppose that a change in government spending increases income by $100. If the marginal propensity to consume is 0.6, then each additional dollar of income will be spent, and the change in output will be 0.6 dollars for every additional dollar of income.\nIf the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, then each additional dollar of income will be spent, and the change in output will be 0.8 dollars for every additional dollar of income. In this case, the change in government spending will have a greater short run impact on real output.\nThe velocity of money is the ratio of the number of times money is used to the size of the money supply. A change in the velocity of money will not have a greater short run impact on real output."}

A country's wealth is determined by how it uses its factors of production. For example, if a country uses its capital and labor to produce more goods and services, its wealth will increase. With increased wealth, a country can produce and sell more goods and services.\nThe long-run aggregate supply curve shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services produced in the long run. The long-run aggregate supply curve is a downward-sloping curve because, as the price level rises, the quantity of goods and services produced in the long run will decrease. This is because the higher price level makes it more expensive to produce and sell goods and services, so producers will decide to sell fewer goods and services.\nWhen one of the following happens, the long-run aggregate supply curve will shift to the right:\nThe price level rises.\nThe quantity of materials, labor, or capital available for production increases.\nThe productivity of labor or capital increases.\nThe long-run aggregate supply curve will shift to the left when:\nThe price level falls.\nThe quantity of materials, labor, or capital available for production decreases.\nThe productivity of labor or capital decreases.\nSOLUTION: Annual limits to immigration of foreign citizens will shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the left. This policy will decrease the quantity of labor available for production. The long-run aggregate supply curve is a downward-sloping curve, which means that a decrease in the quantity of labor available for production will shift the curve to the left.\nWhen a nation devotes more resources to nondurable consumption goods rather than durable capital goods, the long-run aggregate supply curve will shift to the left.

This is because the tariff is no longer adding to the price of the steel.\nThe price of domestic steel remains higher than the price of imported steel. So, domestic steel producers are now less competitive than they were before the tariff was removed.\nIncome is transferred from foreign steel producers to domestic steel producers.\nAllocative efficiency is not improved. Allocative efficiency is the efficiency with which a country's resources are used. A protective tariff does not change the way a country's resources are used."}

The tax multiplier is positive.\nIf taxes increase, then consumers and businesses have less money to spend on goods and services. This decrease in spending reduces the incomes of workers and the profits of businesses. As a result, the multiplier effect of government spending is smaller. So, the spending multiplier is lower.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the reserve ratio increases the tax multiplier. The reserve ratio is the ratio of reserves to deposits that banks hold. An increase in the reserve ratio means that banks have to hold more reserves. This reduces the amount of money that banks can lend.\nThe effect of this reduction in lending is similar to a tax increase. Consumers and businesses have less money to spend on goods and services.

W. Phillips, who first noticed this relationship in 1958. However, the curve has been the subject of much debate, as its inverse relationship does not hold over the long run.\nSOLUTION: The Phillips curve represents the relationship between inflation and unemployment. When unemployment is low, workers have more bargaining power, and employers must offer higher wages to attract workers. Higher wages lead to higher prices, and that causes inflation to go up.\nWhen inflation is low, prices are relatively stable. Workers have less bargaining power, and employers do not have to offer higher wages. As a result, inflation is more likely to be low."}

Subsidies can be used to encourage behavior that is beneficial to others or to support industries that are important to the economy.\nA regulation is a rule that the government imposes on individuals or companies. Regulations can be used to protect public health and the environment or to prevent consumer fraud.\nSOLUTION: The government can use a tax to discourage firms from wasting resources. Firms that waste resources use more of them than is necessary for producing goods and services. By using more resources, these firms make it harder for the economy to grow, and they can even harm the environment.\nA tax on firms that waste resources would increase the cost of producing goods and services.

The curve is upward sloping, which means that an increase in the price level leads to an increase in the quantity of output. But the curve is not a straight line. It is classified as a Classical curve, a J-curve, or an S-curve depending on whether it is elastic, unit-elastic, or inelastic.\nThe table below shows the values of the aggregate supply curve for different price levels.\nPrice level | Quantity of output\n100 | 80\n120 | 100\nThe curve is Classical. This means that it is elastic up to the midpoint price level and inelastic beyond the midpoint price level.\nAt the midpoint price level, the quantity of output is produced with no extra cost. So, the curve is unit-elastic at that price level.\nThe curve is not elastic at any price level. This means that an increase in the price level will not cause firms to produce less.\nSOLUTION: The equilibrium price level remains unchanged while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\nTo see this, look at the values of the curve at the prevailing price level. The aggregate supply curve is 100-80=20. The equilibrium quantity of output is the quantity for which the price level equals the equilibrium price level.

When the government increases its spending or decreases its taxes, it is engaged in expansionary fiscal policy. When the government decreases its spending or increases its taxes, it is engaged in contractionary fiscal policy.\nFiscal policy can have an impact on the economy even without any change in monetary policy. For example, an increase in government spending will generally increase the demand for goods and services, leading to an increase in production. As a result of the increase in production, businesses will tend to earn higher profits. Higher profits can lead to more investment in new technologies and equipment.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is A. To eliminate a recessionary gap, the government can increase its spending on goods and services, and it can also cut taxes. When the government does this, the increased spending will lead to an increase in production.

Fiscal policy involves the government's use of taxes and government spending.\nThe Federal Reserve can use monetary policy to decide how to set interest rates and influence the money supply. Monetary policy involves the management of interest rates and the money supply to stabilize the economy.\nGovernment spending: When the government spends more money, it increases national income. This can create a short-term increase in employment, but it also increases inflation.\nTaxes: When the government collects more money in taxes, it reduces national income. This can create a short-term decrease in employment, but it decreases inflation.\nMoney supply: The money supply is the total amount of money in the economy. The Federal Reserve can make more money available by lending money to banks or by buying financial assets. When the money supply increases, inflation may increase.\nInterest rates: The Federal Reserve can change interest rates to control the amount of money in the economy. When interest rates go up, it becomes more expensive to borrow money, and businesses and individuals may spend less. When interest rates go down, it becomes cheaper to borrow money, and businesses and individuals may spend more.\nSOLUTION: At the peak of a typical business cycle, the greatest threat to the macroeconomy is inflation. Inflation is likely to get worse, because the economy is at its peak, and the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been.\nWhen the unemployment rate is low, workers usually have more bargaining power, and employers have to raise wages to attract and keep employees. When wages rise, the prices of goods and services may also go up. This is called cost-push inflation."}

As consumer confidence increases, producers expect to sell more goods and services. So, they will be willing to supply more of these goods and services.\nTo illustrate this idea, imagine that you own a lemonade stand. If you are optimistic about the coming day, you will expect to sell more lemonade. So, you will set up your stand in a busy location, and you will plan to stay open longer.

The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, implements expansionary monetary policy by making it easier for businesses and consumers to get loans. This can be done by lowering the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans.\nWhen the federal funds rate is lowered, interest rates throughout the economy also decrease. As a result, businesses and consumers can borrow money more easily and at a lower cost. They are likely to increase their spending, which boosts the economy.\nSOLUTION: Expansionary monetary policy increases aggregate demand, which increases real GDP and increases employment. When the federal funds rate is lowered, interest rates throughout the economy also decrease. This makes it easier and cheaper for businesses to borrow money. They are likely to use the money to expand their operations and increase their employment. In addition, consumers are able to borrow money more easily and at a lower cost.

When the average price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; in other words, the purchasing power of the currency falls. This decrease in purchasing power is called inflation.\nInflation is a cost to consumers and businesses. When the average price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. So, consumers must give up more of their currency to buy the goods and services they want. Consumers are able to save less of their income because the purchasing power of their savings decreases. Businesses are charged more for the goods and services they buy. Because businesses' costs have increased, they may increase the prices they charge for their own products or services.\nIn addition to these costs, inflation can also lead to misallocations of resources. When businesses charge more for their products or services, consumers will buy less of them. So, some businesses will sell less than they would have if prices were lower. These businesses may lay off workers or reduce their investment in capital equipment. Other businesses will sell more than they would have if prices were higher. These businesses may hire more workers or increase their investment in capital equipment.\nThese misallocations of resources can lead to an inefficient use of the economy's resources. For example, if businesses are selling more goods and services than would have been the case if prices were higher, it may be a signal that the economy is overheating. The central bank may need to raise interest rates to cool down the economy."}

It tells you how much of a change in income is reflected in a change in spending.\nThe consumption function is typically drawn as a function with a positive slope. This means that when income increases, spending also increases. The magnitude of the slope shows the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).\nThe marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of a change in income that is spent. For example, if the MPC is 0.8, then an increase in income of $1 will result in an increase in spending of $0.80.\nThe MPC is an important parameter in macroeconomic forecasting. It affects the magnitude of the consumption curve, which in turn affects the overall level of spending and the overall level of income in the economy.\nSOLUTION: If households are more optimistic about the future, they are likely to be more confident in their ability to afford a higher lifestyle. This will increase their marginal propensity to consume, which will increase the slope of the consumption function.\nThe entire consumption function would shift upward."}
{"question": "Which of the following is the most likely to be a deterrent to growth in the economy?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spending on education and training"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increases in capital"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increases in the interest rate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Expenditures on research and development"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The economy is the sum of all the activities that are used to produce goods and services in a country. The economy grows when the total value of goods and services produced increases.\nThere are many factors that can affect economic growth. Some of the most important factors include the amount of capital per worker, the interest rate, spending on research and development, and education and training.\nCapital per worker refers to the amount of machinery, computers, and other equipment each worker has to use. More capital per worker can increase the output of each worker.\nThe interest rate is the cost of borrowing money. When the interest rate is high, it is more expensive to borrow money. This makes it more difficult for businesses to grow, as they must use more of their money to pay interest.\nSpending on research and development is the money that businesses spend on coming up with new products and ideas. Research and development can help businesses create new products that people want to buy.\nEducation and training help people acquire the skills they need to perform their jobs. A better-educated and trained workforce can increase the productivity of workers.\nSOLUTION: Increases in interest rates make it more expensive to borrow money. This can slow down economic growth. When borrowing costs more, people are likely to spend less. This decrease in spending can affect all parts of the economy.\nIncreases in the interest rate are a deterrent to growth in the economy."}

This is called a depreciation of the currency.\nWhen the price level of a country's currency goes down, the currency becomes stronger in relation to other currencies. This is called an appreciation of the currency.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the price level reduces total spending in the economy because I. consumers' incomes cannot go as far now that prices have risen.\nHigher prices mean that the same amount of money will buy you fewer goods and services. So, consumers must give up some goods and services when prices go up. Giving up some goods and services means that total spending goes down.\nII. foreigners by less.\nWhen prices go up in a country, the value of that country's currency goes up in foreign exchange markets. This means that other countries' currencies must be worth less in relation to that country's currency. For example, if the price of a currency goes up from 0.50 to 0.55, that means each country's currency is worth 5% more than before.\nSince foreigners' currencies are worth less in relation to the local currency, foreigners will have to spend more of their foreign currency to buy the same goods and services. This will lower the amount of spending in the economy.\nIII. higher prices result in higher interest rates which lower spending.\nWhen prices go up, the inflation rate goes up. The inflation rate is the rate at which prices go up.\nThe inflation rate affects the interest rates that people and businesses get when they save or borrow money. Higher interest rates can be good for savers and businesses, but they can also slow down spending.\nWhen interest rates go up, fewer people and businesses will want to borrow money. And when borrowing costs more, people and businesses will want to spend less."}

This causes the output to decrease in the short run.\nThe price level, however, depends on the behavior of both consumers and producers. A decrease in investment will cause the price level to decrease in the short run.\nA technological advance represents an improvement in the productivity of labor and capital. As a result of a technological advance, the productivity of labor and capital increases.\nThe increase in productivity raises the output of goods and services for each unit of labor and capital. Since the cost of producing goods and services does not increase, the price level decreases as a result of a technological advance.\nA decline in labor productivity would be caused by a decrease in the productivity of labor. This could happen if workers are sick or on vacation or if they are less productive for some other reason.\nSince it is more difficult to produce goods and services when labor productivity decreases, the cost of producing goods and services goes up. This increase in cost will cause the price level to increase.\nAn uptick in net exports means that the value of exports increased while the value of imports decreased.\nSince net exports are the difference between exports and imports, an uptick in net exports will cause the value of goods and services produced to increase. As a result of this increase in output, the price level will increase.\nSOLUTION: A technological advance is a change in the productivity of labor and capital. A technological advance will increase the productivity of labor and capital.\nAn increase in the productivity of labor and capital raises the output of goods and services for each unit of labor and capital. Since the cost of producing goods and services does not increase, the price level decreases as a result of a technological advance.\nA decrease in investment will cause the price level to decrease in the short run.

As a result, employers must raise wages to compete for workers. Raising wages increases the cost of labor. Because the cost of labor is a component of the price of goods and services, the inflation rate rises.\nWhen the inflation rate rises, the Federal Reserve may decide to raise the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other. When the federal funds rate rises, the interest rates that banks charge their customers for loans also rise. As a result, people and businesses have to pay more to borrow money. When the cost of borrowing money rises, people and businesses will usually spend less and invest less.\nAs the demand for goods and services falls, the inflation rate also falls.

There are several ways that money is created and put into circulation. One way is for people to take out loans from banks. Banks create money when they make loans. This is done by creating a bank account for the borrower. The bank then holds the borrower's money until the borrower repays the loan.\nWhen a bank makes a loan, it also puts up the money to cover the loan. This money is called the bank's reserve. The reserve is held by the bank. It is not put into circulation.\nA bank's reserve ratio is the percentage of its deposits that are held as reserves. The reserve ratio is set by the central bank of the country.\nFor example, if the central bank requires a bank to hold reserves equal to 10% of its deposits, the bank's reserve ratio is 10%.\nSOLUTION: A bank has $1000 in deposits and is required to reserve $250. So, the bank has $750 in excess reserves.\nThe bank's reserve ratio is 25%. This means that the bank has 25% of its deposits in reserves.

As a result, they can afford to hire more workers.\nThe government does not need to do anything to create jobs when the economy is strong. But when the economy is in a recession, people have less money to spend. This decrease in spending can cause businesses to lay off workers.\nTo help the economy recover from a recession, the government can use automatic stabilizers. For example, when a recession occurs, people have less money to spend. This decrease in spending can cause tax revenue to decrease. But because the government has already collected tax revenue during the economic expansion, it has more money to spend. So, the government can use the money it has already collected to help create jobs and stimulate the economy.\nSOLUTION: As the economy recovers from a recession, government expenditures increase, and taxes do not need to change. For example, in a recession, people have less money to spend. This decrease in spending can cause businesses to lay off workers. But if the government lays off workers in its military or civil service, it must raise taxes to support these workers.

So, increasing the money supply will not stimulate short-run production and employment with very little long-run inflation.\nIncreasing the money supply will increase short-run output but it is the source of long-run inflation. As the prices of goods and services go up, the value of money goes down. This means that each dollar will buy fewer goods and services in the long run.\nLowering the unemployment rate while also lowering the rate of inflation is impossible according to the quantity theory of money. Either the unemployment rate will go down, or the rate of inflation will go down, but not both.\nIncreasing the nation's long-run capacity to produce means that the country will have more goods and services in the long run. According to the quantity theory of money, increasing the money supply will increase prices. So, the long-run effect of an increase in the money supply is that the prices of goods and services will go up."}

If the economy is headed toward a recession, classical economists believe that the downturn will eventually turn into an upswing. They do not believe that the government should try to intervene.\nIf the economy is headed toward inflation, classical economists believe that the inflation will cause interest rates to rise, which will start a recession. The recession will bring the inflation under control.\nThis is the classical answer to the question of how to deal with inflation:\nIf the demand curve for money is relatively flat, the government should not try to fine-tune the economy. The economy will adjust itself.\nIf the quantity theory of money is correct, the quantity of money in an economy affects inflation. An increase in the quantity of money will cause a decrease in the value of money, which will cause inflation. This decrease in the value of money is called inflation.\nThe aggregate supply curve is L-shaped. The aggregate supply curve shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of output. It is L-shaped because the curve is upward-sloping, which means that a higher price level is associated with a higher quantity of output. But the curve is not downward-sloping, which means that a lower price level is not associated with a higher quantity of output."}

There are several ways to measure GDP, but the most commonly used are current-dollar GDP, real GDP, and inflation-adjusted GDP.\nThe current-dollar GDP measures the value of goods and services in today's dollars. The value of goods and services in today's dollars is called the current price. The current-dollar GDP is calculated by using the current prices of goods and services.\nThe real GDP measures the value of goods and services in a particular year's dollars. The value of goods and services in a particular year's dollars is called the constant price. The real GDP is calculated by using the constant prices of goods and services.\nThe inflation-adjusted GDP is a variation of the real GDP. It is called the real GDP. The real GDP is calculated by using the constant prices of goods and services. But how do you know the constant prices? One way is to use the prices from a particular year and call them the constant prices. This is called fixed-base measurement. A problem with fixed-base measurement is that it does not take into account the inflation that occurred outside of the selected base year.\nAnother way is to use the prices from a base year and adjust them for the rate of inflation. This is called chain-type measurement. The chart below shows the difference between fixed-base and chain-type measurement.\nThe BEA typically uses chain-type measurement, which is also known as chain-weighted or deflator-based measurement. The real GDP is measured by finding the nominal GDP and then adjusting for the inflation.\nNominal GDP is the value of goods and services in current prices. To find the nominal GDP, use the current prices of goods and services.\nThe real GDP is the nominal GDP adjusted for the inflation. To find the real GDP, use the constant prices of goods and services. The constant prices are obtained by dividing the current prices into the prices from a base year.\nThe base year is the year that is used to determine the constant prices. The BEA typically uses the base year as the latest year for which data is available. For example, the real GDP for 2016 is the nominal GDP for 2016 adjusted for the inflation using the prices from 2015.\nSOLUTION: The real GDP is GDP adjusted for price changes. This means that the real GDP is measured in constant, or inflation-adjusted, prices. The real GDP is calculated by using the constant prices of goods and services.\nThe other choices are not calculated for the United States."}

Import quotas are often put in place to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. A country may impose an import quota on a good if it wants to conserve resources, promote national security, or protect the environment.\nWhen an import quota is imposed, the domestic supply of the good increases, while the foreign supply of the good decreases. The domestic supply curve and the foreign supply curve both shift. The world price of the good remains unchanged, but the domestic price is lower than the world price, and the foreign price is higher than the world price.\nSOLUTION: When an import quota is imposed, the domestic supply of the good increases, while the foreign supply of the good decreases. So, the domestic supply curve shifts rightward. Because the world price of the good remains unchanged, the new domestic price is lower than the world price.\nThe import quota increases the demand for domestic producers and reduces the demand for foreign producers. So, the misallocation of resources happens away from efficient foreign producers and toward inefficient domestic producers."}

There are several ways a nation's trade deficit might worsen:\nWages: If wages in a nation are lower than in other nations, then companies in the nation will probably pay more to produce goods and services. This will make those goods and services more expensive than the goods and services produced in other nations. As a result, consumers in the nation will probably buy more goods and services from other nations and less from the nation. This will worsen the nation's trade deficit.\nTaxes: If taxes on corporate profits are higher in a nation than in other nations, then companies will pay more in taxes.

If the money supply grows, inflation will grow. If the money supply shrinks, inflation will shrink.\nThe money supply includes all the money in circulation, as well as funds that are readily available in banks.\nThe Federal Reserve can affect the money supply. For example, the Federal Reserve can make it easier for banks to lend money by lowering interest rates. This action increases the money supply and can lead to inflation.\nThe Federal Reserve can also make it harder for banks to lend money by raising interest rates. This action decreases the money supply and can lead to deflation.\nSOLUTION: The text argues that the money supply is continuous. This means that there is always a supply of money available."}
{"question": "Which of the following could limit the ability of a central bank to conduct expansionary monetary policy?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Money demand is nearly perfectly elastic."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Investment demand is nearly perfectly elastic."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Banks make loans with all excess reserves."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Households carry very little cash holding their money in checking and saving deposits."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Central banks have three main tools they use to conduct monetary policy, which is the process of managing the money supply and interest rates. By using these tools, central banks can help the economy grow and keep the rate of inflation stable.\nThe three tools of monetary policy are:\nSetting interest rates: Interest rates are the prices that lenders charge to borrow money. When interest rates are high, it is expensive to borrow money. Companies and people will not invest or buy as much when interest rates are high. This slows down the economy. To help the economy grow, the central bank can lower interest rates.\nSetting the money supply: The money supply is the total amount of money in the economy. When there is more money in the economy, each dollar is worth less. When there is less money in the economy, each dollar is worth more. When the central bank increases the money supply, the value of each dollar goes down. This makes it cheaper to borrow money. So, people will buy more goods and services. And businesses will invest more.\nCredit policy: The central bank can also change the credit policy. This is the amount of money that the central bank lends to banks. The cost of borrowing this money is called the discount rate. The central bank can change the discount rate. When the discount rate is high, it is expensive for banks to borrow money. So, banks will not borrow as much money. When the discount rate is low, banks can borrow money more cheaply. So, they will borrow and lend more money.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D. If households carry very little cash and hold most of their money in checking and savings deposits, as in an economy with universal banking, then an increase in the money supply will not increase the total quantity of money. This lack of money demand will limit the ability of a central bank to conduct expansionary monetary policy."}

The Fed was created in 1913 to manage the nation's money supply and to serve as a bank for the U.S. government and other banks.\nThe Fed has three main jobs:\n1. To manage the nation's money supply: The Fed can make money more expensive or less expensive by changing the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans. When the interest rate is lower, it is cheaper for banks to lend money, and when the interest rate is higher, it is more expensive.\nThe interest rate that the Fed charges for overnight loans is called the federal funds rate. When the federal funds rate changes, the interest rates that banks charge their customers also change.\nSome of the ways that the Fed makes money more expensive or less expensive include:\n* Raising the federal funds rate: When the Fed raises the federal funds rate, it makes money more expensive. This can help control inflation.\n* Lowering the federal funds rate: When the Fed lowers the federal funds rate, it makes money less expensive. This can help spur economic growth.\n2. To serve as a bank for the U.S. government and other banks: The Fed can lend money to other banks and to the U.S. government. This can help ensure that there is enough money in the banking system.\n3.

When the government spends more money, it increases the income of the people who receive that money. The increase in income makes those people better able to afford goods and services. As a result, the demand for those goods and services will increase, and the aggregate demand curve will shift to the right.\nA decrease in income taxes will also cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right.

When people in other countries have more money to spend, they can buy more goods and services from the United States. The increase in demand for U.S. exports will increase the demand for the goods and services that use those exports. As a result, the aggregate demand curve will shift to the right.\nExpectations of surpluses of goods in the future will cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left.

{"question": "According to Keynesian economists", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the investment demand curve is relatively elastic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the economy is inherently stable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "inadequate supply is largely to blame for periods of stagnation"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Keynesian economists believe that the economy can descend into a self-reinforcing cycle of decline, in which inadequate demand leads to cutbacks in spending, which in turn lower income and lead to further decreases in demand. They argue that government can play a useful role in helping to stabilize the economy by increasing spending, or by cutting taxes, in times of economic decline.\nSOLUTION: According to Keynesian economists, the investment demand curve is relatively elastic, which means that a change in the exchange rate will have a greater effect on investment than on the overall level of demand. Fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy, because fiscal policy involves changes in government spending or taxes, and those changes directly affect the overall level of demand.\nInadequate supply is largely to blame for periods of stagnation, according to Keynesian economists. When the economy is in a period of stagnation, with inadequate demand, it is difficult for the economy to reach its full potential output. This is because, when demand is inadequate, firms have little incentive to increase their output.\nThe economy is inherently stable, according to Keynesian economists. When the economy is stable, the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment is said to be positive. This means that as the amount of economic activity increases, the level of inflation also increases. But the long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment is said to be negative. This means that, in the long run, a higher level of inflation is associated with a higher level of unemployment."}

The curve is upward sloping, which means that an increase in the price level will generally increase aggregate supply.\nWhen the price level rises, the price of goods and services rises. A higher price induces sellers to produce and sell more goods and services. As a result of the higher price, the quantity of goods and services sellers produce and sell will increase. This increase in the quantity is called the quantity effect.\nThe quantity effect is bigger in the short run than in the long run.

The government can change its spending on goods and services or its investments in capital to increase economic growth. It can also change the taxes it collects to increase or decrease the demand for goods and services.\nWhen the economy is growing too quickly, the government may decide to implement fiscal policy to remedy inflation. Inflation is caused when the demand for goods and services is too high. As the demand for goods and services increases, prices rise. Inflation can also occur when there is too much money in the economy.\nThe government can use fiscal policy to help manage inflation by using taxes and government spending to cool down or heat up the economy. For example, the government can decide to cut back on its spending and increase taxes. This can help slow the economy down and reduce the demand for goods and services. Inflation will then decrease.\nAlternatively, the government can increase its spending and decrease taxes. This can help heat up the economy and increase the demand for goods and services. Inflation will then increase.\nSOLUTION: To remedy inflation, the federal government should run a deficit. When the government runs a deficit, it spends more money than it takes in from taxes. This increased spending by the government injects money into the economy. As a result, the demand for goods and services increases, which can heat up the economy and increase inflation."}

Some of the major players include the central bank, the government, and international trade.\nThe central bank is responsible for managing the nation's money supply and interest rates. When the central bank wants to increase economic activity, it lowers interest rates. When it wants to decrease economic activity, it raises interest rates.\nThe government can also affect the economy. If it wants to increase economic activity, it can decrease taxes or increase its spending. When the government spends money, it increases its spending in the economy. For example, the government can buy goods and services from houses and businesses. This increases the demand for goods and services, which in turn increases the production of goods and services.\nInternational trade can also affect the economy. A country that exports a lot of goods and services to other countries is said to have a trade surplus. A country that imports a lot of goods and services from other countries is said to have a trade deficit.\nIf a country has a trade surplus, its economy is usually growing. To keep its economy growing, the government needs to find ways to increase the trade surplus. This can be done by lowering its prices (making its goods and services cheaper for other countries to buy). It can also be done by finding new markets for its goods and services.\nIf a country has a trade deficit, its economy is usually growing. To keep its economy growing, the government needs to find ways to increase the trade deficit. This can be done by lowering the prices of its goods and services (making them cheaper for other countries to buy). It can also be done by finding new markets for its goods and services.\nSOLUTION: An increase in government spending will increase real GDP. When the government spends more money, it increases the demand for goods and services. This leads to an increase in production of goods and services.\nA decrease in government spending will decrease real GDP. When the government spends less money, the demand for goods and services decreases. This leads to a decrease in production of goods and services.\nA decrease in government spending and a decrease in prices are both causes of stagflation.

A tariff increases the price of the good.\nSOLUTION: An import quota on foreign automobiles is expected to increase the price of automobiles and protect domestic producers at the expense of consumers.\nSince the quota limits the number of foreign automobiles that can be imported, foreign automobile companies will have to raise the price of the automobiles they do sell in order to compensate for the higher cost of importing them. As a result of the quota, the price of automobiles will increase, and domestic automobile producers will benefit because they will be selling domestically produced automobiles at a higher price. Domestic automobile consumers, however, will now have to pay more for their automobiles."}

You could try drinking different quantities of coffee and then observe how much coffee you need to drink in order to stay awake. But your experiment has one variable that is not constant: the amount of coffee you drink.\nTo solve this problem, you can use the concept of ceteris paribus. You could tell yourself that you will try to drink different quantities of coffee, but you work in a quiet office and do not have any important calls or appointments. So, you can tell yourself that the amount of coffee you drink is the only thing that is changing.\nThis way, you can figure out if drinking more coffee does actually keep you awake. But if you change any other variables in your experiment, such as the time of day you drink coffee or what you have to do that day, your results will be mixed up and you will not know if it was the coffee that helped you stay awake.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C. Ceteris paribus is the Latin phrase for \"everything else remains constant.\"\nIf energy is taken from a battery, for example, the voltage of the battery will drop. But the voltage of the battery is not changing! Instead, the circuit is doing work, such as powering a device.\nCeteris paribus is a useful tool for thinking about how one variable changes when other variables are held constant."}

There are many ways that governments can restrict imports, but they are often called \"trade barriers\" because they can keep out goods from other countries.\nTariffs are taxes that a country places on imports. When a country raises its tariff on a particular export, the price of that export to consumers in the tariff-raising country will go up.\nIf your country charges a tariff on imported goods, then the price of those goods will be higher than if there were no tariff. Consumers in your country will buy less of the goods, and fewer exports will be sold to your country.\nA quota is a limit on the number of a particular good that can be imported. When the limit is reached, the import of the good is stopped.\nIf your country places a quota on an import, then the quantity of the good that is available to consumers in your country will be lower than if there were no quota. The price of the good will also be higher. Consumers in your country will buy less of the good, and fewer exports will be sold to your country.\nA subsidy is a payment that a country gives to its businesses to keep the prices of their products lower. Subsidies make the products more competitive in the world market.\nA country that subsidizes an export will sell more of the export to other countries. But other countries will sell fewer exports to the subsidizing country.\nEmerson and Sinclair explain how trade barriers can affect the world economy:\n\"When one country puts a trade barrier up, it is like telling the other countries, \"Don't send us your exports.\" This makes the people in the barrier country have to pay more for the goods they want to buy. It also makes the people in the other countries have to pay more for the goods they want to buy.\n\"If many countries put up trade barriers, they will all pay more for the goods they want to buy. They will also sell fewer goods to each other.\n\"So, trade barriers can make the people in a country poorer. They can also make many people around the world poorer.\"\nSOLUTION: If the world price of copper exceeds the domestic (U.S.) price of copper, we would expect the United States to be a net exporter of copper.\nCopper is produced in many countries, but it is also traded between countries. When the world price of copper is higher than the domestic price, it costs more to get copper from within the country than to get it from other countries. So, the United States will export copper to other countries and import copper from them.\nThe United States will sell more copper to other countries than it buys from them. The United States will make money from this trade."}

The Federal Reserve has a goal for the money supply, called the target level of the money supply. The target level of the money supply is called the target federal funds rate.\nWhen the target federal funds rate is increased, the cost of borrowing money is increased. Banks will be able to charge higher interest rates on loans. But how do higher interest rates affect the other parts of the economy?\nHigher interest rates make saving money more attractive, so people will hold less money in the bank. This causes the supply of money to decrease.\nLess money in the economy will cause prices to fall. Lower prices result in lower inflation.\nLower interest rates make borrowing money cheaper. This causes the demand for money to increase.\nBecause the supply of money is decreasing and the demand for money is increasing, the price of money (interest rates) will increase.\nThe Federal Reserve uses the discount rate to change the target federal funds rate. The discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Federal Reserve.\nSOLUTION: The discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the Federal Reserve. When the discount rate is increased, the cost of borrowing money is increased. Banks will be able to charge higher interest rates on loans.\nWhen banks can charge higher interest rates on loans, people are less likely to spend their money. This is because it costs more to borrow money. As a result of people spending less money, businesses will sell fewer goods and services. So, the economy will slow down.\nThe Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks. When the Fed sells these securities, commercial banks get cash. With the cash, they can make loans to people and businesses.\nThe sale of these securities does not change the total amount of money in the economy. But it does increase the money supply.\nThe reserve ratio is the ratio of reserves to deposits that banks are required to hold. When the reserve ratio is increased, the amount of reserves that banks are required to hold is increased.\nBanks can now hold more money, so they do not need to borrow as much money from the Federal Reserve. When the Fed does not lend as much money, the supply of money in the economy decreases.\nThe target federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks can lend and borrow money. When the target federal funds rate is increased, the cost of borrowing money is increased. Banks will be able to charge higher interest rates on loans."}

It can be caused by an increase in the labor productivity of the economy, which is the amount of goods and services produced by a worker.\nThe wage rate is the price of labor. It is the amount of money paid to a worker for a unit of labor, such as an hour's work.\nWhen the wage rate increases, the supply of labor increases, which makes the labor market tighter. The tightness of the labor market is indicated by the unemployment rate, which is the percentage of workers who are not employed but are looking for a job.\nThe unemployment rate and the wage rate are important when it comes to economic growth. When the unemployment rate is low, workers are in high demand, and the wage rate increases. This increase in the wage rate can lead to an increase in the labor productivity of the economy. The increase in labor productivity can lead to economic growth.\nSOLUTION: An increase in the size of the labor force will result in economic growth. An increase in the size of the labor force occurs when the population increases or when more people are entering the labor market.\nThe labor force is the group of people who are working or looking for work.\nWhen the labor force increases, the wage rate increases, and the increase in the wage rate can lead to an increase in the labor productivity of the economy.

If producers expect the price of a good to be higher in the future, they will increase their output of the good. This will eventually lead to an increase in the current price of the good. But, in the short run, the higher price will cause the quantity demanded to decrease, and the quantity supplied to increase. The increase in the quantity supplied matches the decrease in the quantity demanded, so the equilibrium price and quantity are both higher than before.\nSOLUTION: When producers of good A expect the price to be higher in the near future, they will increase the quantity of good A that they produce now. This increase in quantity produced will eventually lead to a higher equilibrium price for good A. The higher price will cause the quantity demanded to decrease, and the quantity supplied to increase. The increase in the quantity supplied matches the decrease in the quantity demanded, so the equilibrium price and quantity are both higher than before."}

This increase in spending shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. The economy will move to a higher level of output and a lower level of unemployment.\nCrowding out can occur when the government spends too much on public goods and services, or when it lowers taxes too much. When this happens, the demand for funds from businesses and households increases. This increase in demand for funds will cause interest rates to rise. As a result, the quantity of funds businesses want to borrow will fall, and the quantity of funds households want to borrow will fall.\nAs a result of these falls in borrowing, the demand for labor will fall, and the economy will move to a lower level of output and a higher level of unemployment.\nSOLUTION: Crowding out occurs when consumers and firms spend less offsetting expansionary fiscal policy. When the government spends more on public goods and services, or when it lowers taxes, consumers and businesses have more money to spend. This increase in spending shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. The economy will move to a higher level of output and a lower level of unemployment.\nHowever, crowding out can occur when the increased spending by consumers and businesses is not enough to offset the effect of the expansionary fiscal policy. For example, if interest rates fall too much, the quantity of funds demanded by businesses will exceed the quantity of funds supplied. This excess demand for funds will cause interest rates to fall even further. As a result, the demand for labor will fall, and the economy will move to a lower level of output and a higher level of unemployment."}

They do this by starting new businesses, investing in capital, and employing people. As a result of their efforts, they create new jobs and add to the country's output of goods and services.\nAggregate demand is the total amount of money that people in an economy spend on goods and services. To see why, imagine an economy with only one industry. The figure below shows the relationship between aggregate demand, consumer spending, investment, and output in that industry.\nWhen consumers spend more money, their demand for the industry's output increases. So, the industry's output rises, and companies in the industry have more reason to invest in new capital. The investment in new capital can increase the industry's output even more. As a result, aggregate demand is higher.\nInvestment is the purchase of new capital, such as machinery or buildings. When businesses make investments, they increase their ability to produce goods and services. As a result, aggregate demand is higher.\nOutput is the amount of goods and services that an industry produces. When output is higher, the industry's businesses make more money. They can use this money to invest in new capital or to pay out as profits. Either way, the money goes into the economy. As a result, aggregate demand is higher.\nSOLUTION: The Chinese government makes it increasingly difficult for American firms to export goods to China.\nThis answer is correct for the following reasons: When it is difficult for American firms to export goods to China, those firms have two choices. They can sell their goods in other countries, or they can stop exporting.\nIf American firms sell their goods in other countries, the global demand for American goods rises. So, the global aggregate demand for goods and services rises.\nIf American firms stop exporting, they stop selling their goods. This decrease in sales lowers the output of goods and services. So, the global aggregate demand for goods and services falls."}

When demand for goods and services is increasing, businesses will usually increase production. As a result, prices will begin to rise, and unemployment will begin to fall.\nThere are several ways the monetary authority can increase aggregate demand. It can lower interest rates, which will encourage businesses and households to borrow and spend more. It can also buy government bonds, which will increase the money supply and lower interest rates.\nHere are some potential effects of an expansionary monetary policy:\nInflation will increase. When demand for goods and services is increasing, prices will eventually begin to rise.\nInterest rates will rise. When the monetary authority buys government bonds, it takes money out of circulation. The demand for government bonds goes down, and the bonds' prices go down. The prices of other types of bonds will also fall, and interest rates will eventually rise.\nThe value of the currency will fall. When the money supply goes up, the value of each unit of currency will fall. This can make imports cheaper and exports more expensive."}

So, aggregate output and aggregate income are equal. If one goes up, the other must go up as well.\nThe classical economists argue that the government should not worry about maintaining aggregate demand at an adequate level. Instead, they believe that markets will always return to equilibrium. If demand is insufficient, the price-level will fall. As the price-level falls, the quantity of money demanded will increase, and the economy will return to equilibrium.\nThe classical economists do not believe that wages fluctuate quickly. Instead, they argue that wages are determined by the labor market. If wages fall, then unemployment will rise. The rise in unemployment will cause wages to rise back to their original level.\nThe classical economists do not believe that input and output prices will stay in line with each other. They argue that prices are determined by supply and demand. If output increases, the price level will rise. As the price level rises, the quantity of money demanded will decrease, and the economy will return to equilibrium."}

It has many benefits, but some groups may argue that trade should be restricted for the following reasons:\nTo protect infant industry: Infant industries are businesses that are new to the market and are still growing. To help these businesses compete, governments may restrict trade by imposing high tariffs on imported goods or by restricting access to foreign markets.\nTo promote employment: Restricting trade can help create jobs within a country by reducing the competition for jobs that domestic workers face from foreign workers. This can be done by restricting the import of goods from foreign countries, which can increase demand for domestically produced goods.\nTo fight inflation: Sometimes, allowing a country's currency to be used to purchase foreign goods can lead to inflation. This happens when the demand for foreign goods increases, and the supply of the country's currency also increases. This can drive up the price of the country's currency and lead to inflation. To fight this, a country can restrict trade with foreign countries.\nTo promote a diversity of industries: A country may restrict trade with foreign countries to protect its industries. For example, a country may decide to build its own steel industry to protect its economy from foreign competition. This can help a country promote a diversity of industries.\nSOLUTION: To fight inflation is not an argument for restricting trade. Fighting inflation does not require restricting trade."}

It is calculated by dividing the GDP by the price index.\nThe price index is a measure of the average price change of all goods and services in an economy. It is calculated by summing the price changes for each good and service and then dividing by the total value of all goods and services.\nThe CPI is a common price index that tracks the prices of a basket of goods and services that are typical for households.\nThe CPI can be used to calculate the inflation rate, which is the rate at which the average price level is increasing. The inflation rate is calculated by comparing the CPI today to the CPI yesterday.\nIf the CPI today is higher than the CPI yesterday, then the inflation rate is positive.\nIf the CPI today is lower than the CPI yesterday, then the inflation rate is negative.\nIf the CPI today is equal to the CPI yesterday, then the inflation rate is zero.\nSOLUTION: The GDP deflator incorporates current year quantities in its calculations. To calculate the GDP deflator, you need to know the value of all the goods and services produced and sold in the current year and the price of each good and service.\nThe CPI incorporates current year prices in its calculations. To calculate the CPI, you need to know the prices of all the goods and services in the current year.\nThe GDP deflator uses base year quantities in its calculations. This means that the GDP deflator is not affected by changes in the mix of goods and services produced and sold.\nThe mix of goods and services produced and sold is the types of goods and services that an economy produces and sells. For example, if an economy produces and sells more services and fewer goods over time, its mix of goods and services has changed.\nThe CPI is affected by changes in the mix of goods and services produced and sold. When the mix of goods and services changes, the CPI will change, even if the average price level has not changed."}

A tariff is a tax on imported goods. A quota is a limit on the number or amount of a particular good that can be imported.\nTariffs and quotas can affect the price and availability of goods in the imposing nation.\nWhen a tariff is placed on imported goods, the price of those goods will increase. The higher price will also reduce the quantity of the good sold. But the imposing nation will collect more tax revenue.\nWhen a quota is set on imported goods, the price of the goods will increase. But the quantity of the good sold will be limited.\nTariffs and quotas can also harm the nations that impose them. Higher prices will reduce the demand for domestically produced goods that use the imported goods as raw materials. And the reduced demand will lead to lower profits for domestic businesses.\nSOLUTION: A tariff is a tax on imported goods. When a country raises its tariffs, imports become more expensive. So, the domestic price of the imported goods will increase.\nA quota is a limit on the number or amount of a particular good that can be imported. When a country lowers its quota for a good, the domestic price of the good will increase.\nTariffs and quotas do not necessarily affect domestic prices. If a country lowers its tariffs or raises its quota, domestic prices may go down."}
