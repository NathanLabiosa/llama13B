This theory asserts that the mass-media system is controlled by those who own and operate the media, and that this system serves the interests of the elite. According to this theory, the media serve as a system of dominance, conveying the values and power of the elite to the masses.\nMass-society theory suggests that the content of the media is determined by market forces. This theory holds that the media tailor their content to the preferences of the largest audience possible. According to this theory, the media provide entertainment and information that appeals to the mainstream audience.\nMass-society theory also suggests that the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers. This theory contends that the media have a hold on the masses, controlling their thoughts and beliefs. According to this theory, the media create false needs and desires in the masses, leading them to serve the interests of the elite.\nAudiences make selective interpretations of media messages. This theory asserts that audiences are not passive in their interactions with the media. According to this theory, audiences actively make meaning from media messages, using their own values and experiences to interpret the messages they receive.\nSOLUTION: The media do not completely manipulate the masses as passive consumers. Instead, audiences make selective interpretations of media messages. This theory asserts that audiences are not passive in their interactions with the media.

Families pass on cultural capital to their children, and this cultural capital helps the children maintain their class position.\nCultural capital includes both the social knowledge and the material cultural items that are passed down through families. This cultural capital is a key factor in reproducing class.\nBourdieu identified two types of cultural capital:\n1. Habitus: A set of dispositions that have been passed down through a family. These dispositions are gained during childhood and are shared by members of a class. Habitus shapes the way people behave and respond to cultural events.\n2. Social network: The network of people who are in the same class. These people share their cultural capital and can help each other out with things such as finding jobs, getting loans, and gaining political power.\nCertain cultural practices are also part of cultural capital. For example, being able to appreciate high culture, such as going to an opera, is part of cultural capital.\nBourdieu also identified culpable capture, which can occur when people from a lower class adopt the cultural practices of a higher class. If these people are successful in doing so, they may be viewed as having \"captured\" the cultural capital of a higher class. But this captured cultural capital does not make them part of the higher class."}

She found that there was a wide variation in the ways that these societies did or did not allow men and women to participate in certain activities. She concluded that gender roles are not universal. Rather, they are a product of a society's culture."}

Norms are the unwritten rules in a group that prescribe how people should behave.\nAlcohol consumption is an example of behavior that can be labeled as deviant. How many drinks are too many? It is a norm that applies to all groups. But the exact number of drinks is a matter of debate, and what one person considers an appropriate number of drinks may be different from what another person considers appropriate.\nSo, deviance is relative. Behavior that is considered deviant in one group may not be considered deviant in another group.\nSome deviance is punished by the authorities, but most deviance is punished by social reactions.\nSocial reactions to deviance can include disapproval, punishment, and labeling.\nDisapproval is a negative reaction to deviance. Parents may disapprove of children who come home late for a curfew.\nPunishment is a response to deviance that involves making the offender suffer in some way. People who break the law can be fined or sent to prison.\nLabeling is a social reaction to deviance that involves applying a negative label to an individual. People who are labeled as troublemakers may have a hard time fitting in with the groups they are part of."}

One of the positive effects is that it allows for a wider range of people to have a voice in public discussions. The low cost of participating on the Internet has allowed more people to participate in public discussions. The Internet also allows people to join public discussions from around the world.\nThe negative effect of the Internet on the public sphere is that it may be reproducing peer groups from face-to-face situations online. Online, people are likely to interact with others who are similar to themselves. This is called homophily. As a result, the Internet may be reproducing peer groups, rather than creating a truly public sphere."}

Beethoven's music is often emotional and personal, but he also understood when to be sensitive and when to be strong.\nIn the 1800s, many people believed that men should be aggressive and in control. This is reflected in the works of legendary writer Ernest Hemingway, who designed his male characters to be adventurous, violent, and in charge.\nThe feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s helped to change the idea of what it meant to be a man. Men were no longer expected to be aggressive and in control.

This change was fueled by the urbanization of the population and the growth of industries in cities.\nThe urbanization of the population means that people are moving into cities. Starting in the 1800 s, many immigrants came to the United States and settled in cities such as New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Today, people native to the United States also tend to live in cities. In 2000, 77% of Americans lived in urban areas, compared to 50% in 1870.\nThe growth of industries in cities also contributed to urbanization. Cities had a large supply of workers and were close to markets, both domestic and international. These factors made cities attractive places for businesses to locate. As businesses located in cities, they created jobs, which lured even more people to the cities.\nSOLUTION: This map shows the major cities and the parts of the country most affected by urbanization.\nThe region most urbanized is the eastern half of the United States. This area has the most people, industries, and jobs. The area least urbanized is the western United States. This region has the fewest people, industries, and jobs."}

These roles can include those of daughter, son, worker, and citizen. As you interact with others, you will learn about the roles that are available in your society and the expectations that come with them. You will also learn how to behave in specific roles.\nRole-learning theory explains how people learn social roles. This theory suggests that people learn roles by observing others and by practicing the behaviors associated with a role. As you learn a role, you will also learn the values and attitudes that are associated with the role.\nSOLUTION: Role-learning theory suggests that people learn roles by observing others and by practicing the behaviors associated with a role.\nTo learn a role, you must learn the expected behaviors and values of that role. You can learn these by observing others who play the role. For example, a girl learns the behaviors and values of the role of daughter by watching her mother.\nA social role is not fixed or stable, but instead is fluid and pluralistic. This means that a role can have different behaviors and expectations depending on the situation. For example, the role of worker can have different behaviors and expectations in different jobs.\nSocial roles are not given by a predetermined framework. Instead, they are created and negotiated through interaction with others. This means that a role is created by the expectations of the people who interact with the person in that role. For example, the behaviors and expectations of the role of worker are created by the employee's boss and coworkers.\nRoles do not have to be learned to suppress unconscious motivations. Instead, roles are learned because they can help people gain the rewards that they desire. For example, people want to be part of their group and to feel good about themselves. The behaviors and values of the roles of daughter, son, worker, and citizen can help people gain these rewards."}

It also believed that objective truth exists and that human beings can reach it through the use of reason.\nPostmodernism, by contrast, questions these ideas. It says that progress is not necessarily a steady journey. It also says that there is no such thing as objective truth. Instead, it believes that different people have different truths."}

The mode of production includes the ways that goods and services are produced and the relationships through which they are produced.\nMarx believed that these relationships have a profound impact on the character of the society. He argued that there are many different modes of production, and that different modes of production are associated with different types of societies.\nFor example, in a slave society, one group of people owns and controls the means of production (the slaves). In a feudal society, one group of people owns and controls the means of production (the lords). In a capitalist society, the means of production are owned and controlled by the bourgeoisie (the capitalists).\nSOLUTION: In Marx's theory, the mode of production means the organization of a society's technical and human resources that is used to produce goods and services. The way that goods and services are made in a factory is part of the mode of production. But the mode of production is not the same as the way that goods and services are made in a factory."}

To resist cultural domination, some countries have tried to create their own versions of these programs, featuring local actors and reflecting local values. For example, the Mexican telenovela, or \"soap opera,\" is a local version of the American telenovela.\nControlling the distribution of imported products: Some countries have tried to limit the distribution of imported American programs by banning satellite dishes. Satellite dishes allow people to receive broadcasts from other countries. By banning satellite dishes, these countries hope to protect their own television industries from American competition.\nCreating \"reverse flows\" of their own programs back to imperial societies: Some countries have tried to create their own programs based on their own cultures and values, and then export these programs to the United States. The hope is that these programs will become popular in the United States and compete with American programs.\nSOLUTION: The passage suggests that national cultures can resist American cultural domination of the media by creating \"reverse flows\" of their own programs back to imperial societies.

One of the main ways that a firm's managers can maximize profits is by reducing the costs of the products they produce. One way to reduce costs is to find ways to make employees more productive.\nSome firms have found that employing workers on a part-time or temporary basis can be easier and less expensive than hiring full-time employees. For example, a part-time or temporary employee is often less expensive to hire and train. In addition, a part-time or temporary employee may be more willing to work overtime or to work on short notice.\nThe rise of temporary and part-time employment is a response to the pressures of the market.

Prices revealed what goods and services were available and how much they cost. Prices helped people make intelligent decisions about what to buy and what to produce.\nBut what happens when prices are not allowed to send this information? What happens when the government imposes price controls?\nPrice controls are laws that set prices for goods and services. When the government sets prices, it is usually trying to make goods and services cheaper.\nHowever, price controls can have unexpected consequences. When the price of a good or service is set below its market value, the result is often a shortage. When the price is set above its market value, the result is often a surplus.\nFor example, if the government sets a price below the market value for a certain type of food, there will be a shortage of that food. Some people will not be able to buy the food at the controlled price. But if they are willing to pay a higher price, the food will be gone!\nAlternatively, if the government sets a price above the market value for a certain type of food, there will be a surplus of that food. More food will be sold than people want to buy. Some producers will make a lower price, but they will lose money!"}

Social interaction is a process through which individuals interpret and create meanings from their behaviors and the behaviors of others. This theory focuses on the ways in which individuals interact and create meanings through their behavior.\nMead defined the \"generalized other\" as the image of how people in the wider society might perceive our behavior. This image includes the values, beliefs, and customs of the society. As we interact with others, we create an image of what it means to be a person. This image is our sense of the \"generalized other.\"\nSOLUTION: Mead's theory is a structural theory of society. It focuses on the ways in which individuals interact and create meanings through their behavior. Mead was reacting against the structural theories of society that came before his work. These earlier theories focused on the structure of society, its rules, and its institutions. Mead was interested in the way that these structures and institutions are experienced and interpreted by individuals."}

He claimed that under capitalism, the product is not owned by the producers, so they are alienated, or separated, from the product. This alienation happens because workers do not receive the full product of their labor. The employer, the capitalist, takes the lion's share of the product. This process of production also becomes a way of life, a pattern of life, that is imposed on the producers. They are compelled to sell their labor in order to live. So, the producers are alienated from the process of production and from each other.\nSOLUTION: The last paragraph of the passage explains that Marx believed that capitalism had alienated workers from each other and from humanity in general. This alienation happens because workers are compelled to sell their labor in order to live. In selling their labor, they are exchanging their humanity, their creative intelligence, for money. This process of exchanging humanity for money is called commodification.\nMarx claimed that capitalism had also alienated workers from the product they were making. This alienation happens because workers do not receive the full product of their labor. The employer, the capitalist, takes the lion's share of the product."}

These codes refer to explicit, context-independent meanings. This means that the sender's message cannot be interpreted differently than intended.\nFor example, using baby talk to speak to a child could lead to the child's confusion. The child's parent could be using a restricted code that limits the child's audience to those who are not the child."}

Communications technologies make it easier for people to connect with each other, no matter where they are in the world.\nThe extended power of nation states is not a feature of globalization. Nation states are political entities with their own laws and regulations. Globalization is the process of linking groups and places across the world.\nAn increasing awareness of the world as a whole is a result of globalization. As people and countries connect, they become more aware of the world around them.\nThe stretching of social relations beyond national boundaries is a feature of globalization.

They do not try to impose their own values or opinions on the things they investigate.\nWhen a situation is difficult to observe, sociologists may use both empirical research and logical reasoning to make inferences about the situation. For example, they may use surveys, statistical analyses, or laboratory experiments to help them understand how people are affected by the mass media.\nSOLUTION: Sociology focuses on the researchers' own experiences.\nThis answer choice is incorrect. Sociology is based on empirical research, which involves observing and experimenting with the world. This approach is described in the previous slide.\nMany different researchers have conducted studies on a wide range of social issues. So, sociology's knowledge is accumulated from many different research contexts.\nThis answer choice is incorrect. Sociologists try to describe the world as it is. They do not make little distinction between the way the world is and the way it ought to be.\nSome researchers use their own experiences to help them make observations about the world. But they do not base their observations on their own experiences alone.\nSome social phenomena may seem subjective or biased. But sociologists try to be as objective as possible.

But income is only one of the rewards people receive for their work. People may also value leisure time, or the time they spend outside of work.\nIn the United States, for example, people work to earn income to provide for their basic needs. But many Americans also value leisure time, which they can use to pursue their interests or simply relax. Leisure time is so highly valued that some Americans choose to work less and enjoy more leisure time.\nSOLUTION: The extension pattern is the tendency of students to leave essay-writing until the last minute and then ask for an extended deadline. This choice is driven by the lifestyle of students, who live in the moment and may not be concerned with the long-term consequences of procrastination."}

In the post-World War II era, the United States was a dominant industrial economy. Most of the country's jobs were in manufacturing, and the country was a major provider of goods to the world.\nHowever, in the 1970s and 1980s, the service sector began to grow, and it has continued to grow to this day. The service sector includes jobs in retail, finance, education, and health care. Now, more Americans work in the service sector than in manufacturing.\nThe shift from a focus on manufacturing to a focus on the service sector has caused a significant shift in the types of jobs available. Many routine jobs in manufacturing have been replaced by machines and computers. This has increased the demand for workers in the service sector, whose jobs are less likely to be replaced by machines.\nSOLUTION: The post-industrial society identified by Bell (1973) involved a shift towards a service economy, based on knowledge and information. This shift has caused the service sector to grow in size and importance."}

This system was based on the idea that people could be consumers as well as producers. In other words, people could buy goods and services in addition to making them. This new system changed the way people spent their time.\nBefore industrial capitalism, leisure was not a well-defined concept. Hunters and gatherers, who were among the first people, did not have leisure. For them, every day was a struggle to find food and shelter. Agricultural people, who began living about 10,000 years ago, had a bit more leisure. But they still had to work many hours to grow their food and keep livestock.\nIndustrial capitalism changed the relationship between work and leisure. As workers were able to produce more goods and services in less time, they had more leisure time. Employers and governments began to regulate leisure time. They created laws to stop people from working too hard and to give workers a few days off each week.\nIn the 1800s, leisure became a distinct period of non-work and relaxation. People could spend their leisure time in regulated and organized activities, such as sports and clubs. They could also use their leisure time to learn about art, science, and nature.\nBy the 1900s, the growth of civic, municipal culture had led to the creation of public libraries, museums, and art galleries. These institutions provided people with a way to enjoy their leisure time."}

They include family, education, religion, and government.\nSocial institutions help to create the patterns of behavior that define a society. They do this by coordinating the actions of people who live in the society. For example, the institution of education coordinates the actions of teachers, parents, and students.\nAcculturation is the process by which people adapt to a new culture. This process may involve adopting new customs, languages, or values.\nSocial mobility is the ability of individuals to move up or down the social ladder. This movement may be based on their own actions or the opportunities that are available to them.\nSocial stratification is the process by which society is divided into layers. These layers, or strata, represent different levels of wealth, power, and prestige.\nCollective behavior is a type of behavior that is carried out by a large group of people. This type of behavior can be spontaneous, such as a riot. Or it can be organized, such as a protest.\nSOLUTION: This example of learning English and the duties of citizenship is an example of acculturation.

It is not meant to be a prescription for how bureaucracies should be. Weber's ideas about bureaucracy were influenced by his observations of modern, large-scale organizations.\nAn ideal type is a set of concepts and definitions that can be used to analyze a social world. An ideal type is not meant to be a description of the real world. Instead, it is a tool for understanding the real world.\nTo use an ideal type to analyze a social world, compare the real world to the ideal type. The differences and similarities can help you understand the real world.\nFor example, if you are using Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy to analyze a organization, you can compare the organization to the ideal type by looking at the following:\nthe organization's rules and how they are enforced\nthe organization's hierarchy\nthe organization's division of labor\nthe organization's relationship to the outside world\nBy comparing the organization to the ideal type, you can see how the organization is similar to or different from Weber's idea of a bureaucracy.\nSOLUTION: Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy has five key features. An organization is an example of bureaucracy if it has all five features.\nThe organization uses formal rules to guide its operations.\nThe organization has a clear hierarchy, with each person having a specific role.\nThe organization uses a division of labor to assign tasks to its employees.\nThe organization focuses on efficiency and on getting things done.\nThe organization is impersonal, meaning that it treats all employees the same way.\nSalaries is not part of Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy. Weber believed that bureaucracies are organized to be efficient, not to pay employees more."}

It has a complex set of rules and regulations that determine decision-making.\nThe public service of a government is a classic example of a bureaucracy. Its main task is to serve the public. But how?\nBy following the rules. Public servants are required to follow the rules and regulations that have been established by the government. These rules are designed to ensure that the government is fair and consistent. For example, the rules might say how funds can be spent, how taxes are assessed, or how permits are granted.\nIf an organization has many rules and regulations, it can be hard to change them. This is because any change would require changing the rules. And since there are many people in the organization, changing the rules would be difficult.\nSo, bureaucracies can be slow to change. This can be both a strength and a weakness. A strength because the rules can ensure that the organization remains fair and consistent. A weakness because the organization may be less able to adapt to a changing environment.\nSOLUTION: A book club in which books are chosen by members who take turns alphabetically to lead discussion has many of the characteristics of a bureaucracy. It has a set of rules (members take turns choosing the book). It has a chain of command (members take turns leading the discussion).\nAn extended or consanguine family is not a bureaucracy. It does not have a complex set of rules and regulations.\nThe government of a large city is not a bureaucracy. It is an organization, but it does not have a complex set of rules and regulations.\nThe volunteers who gather annually to clean the neighborhood are not a bureaucracy.

But over time, traditional practices sometimes change.\nEquilibrium theories of social change explain how traditional customs and beliefs change over time. These theories argue that social change happens when a society's practices stop meeting the needs of its people.\nThese theories explain that when people's needs change, they may change their practices. For example, if a society's economy changes, people's needs change. They may begin to value different practices.\nFor example, as a society's economy becomes more industrial, people's needs can change. They may begin to value practical knowledge more than traditional knowledge. So, the society may begin to value public education more than traditional training."}

One strategy was to make all strike action illegal.\nHowever, this answer choice is incorrect. Making all strike action illegal would effectively outlaw the labor movement.\nAnother strategy the Conservative government used was to impose restrictions on picketing.\nPicketing is a legal method for workers to publicize their grievances.

These machines, or factories, could produce goods much faster than before. This process is called industrialization.\nIndustrialization also brought better ways to move goods and people from place to place. This made it easier to communicate and do business with other countries.\nThere was intense economic, political, and military competition.\nIn the late 1800s, countries were competing to have the most powerful economy, government, and military.\nThis competition made some countries view war as a way to gain advantage."}

These conditions can be political or economic, and they can be difficult to meet.\nDebt repayments with interest can be greater than the amount of money received.\nWhen a country receives economic aid, it may be required to borrow money. The country must then pay back the loan with interest. Over time, the country may owe more than it was lent.\nSOLUTION: The United Nations has refused to call on rich countries to provide economic aid.\nThe United Nations has not been able to reach an agreement on how to help the developing countries. Some countries do not want to provide economic aid to the developing countries."}
