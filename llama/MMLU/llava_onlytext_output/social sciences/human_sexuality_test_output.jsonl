It contains two basic drives: the drive for life (Eros) and the drive for death (Thanatos). The id wants to satisfy every desire, regardless of whether the desire is logical, realistic, or not.\nThe ego is the part of the personality that deals with reality. It uses the id's drives to create plans and make decisions. The ego is responsible for testing these plans in the real world.\nThe superego is the part of the personality that deals with morals and values. It develops from the moral and ethical rules of society. The superego uses the ego's plans and decisions to determine whether they are good or bad.\nThe Oedipus complex is a Freudian concept that describes a desire for a child to have sex with one of his or her parents. This desire is supposed to come from the child's attraction to the opposite-sex parent. According to Freud, this desire is a source of conflict and tension in all human lives.\nSOLUTION: The id was dominant. The decision to join Jacques at the dairy bar was driven by a desire for immediate pleasure, rather than a logical plan for the future."}

These groups believe that abortion is the destruction of a human life. And because they believe that human life begins at fertilization, they may consider abortion to be murder.\nOther religious groups believe that human life begins at birth. These groups may allow abortion, as they do not consider it to be the taking of a human life.\nThere are also religious groups that have specific beliefs about when human life begins. For example, some Orthodox Jews believe that human life begins at the moment of conception. But other Jews have different beliefs.\nSome religious groups consider the health of the mother to be a important factor in deciding whether an abortion is justified. For example, in order to save the life of the mother, some religious groups believe that an abortion is justified. But other religious groups do not consider the health of the mother to be a justification for abortion."}

One follicle becomes the dominant follicle, which continues to grow while the other follicles stop growing.\nAround the time of ovulation, which is when the dominant follicle releases an egg, the ovaries secrete higher-than-normal levels of estrogen.\nThe ovulatory phase begins with ovulation and ends when the egg is no longer in the body. At this time, the uterus secretes substances called prostaglandins, which cause the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for a fertilized egg.\nThe luteal phase begins after ovulation and ends with the start of the next menstrual cycle. During this phase, the ruptured follicle becomes a structure called the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. Progesterone causes the uterus to thicken and prepares it for an embryo. If the egg is fertilized, the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum breaks down, and progesterone levels decrease. This causes the uterus lining to be shed, and menstruation begins.\nSOLUTION: The onset of labor is first triggered by hormones secreted by the fetus' adrenal gland. When the fetus' adrenal gland releases hormones, it triggers the mother's body to stop producing progesterone. Progesterone helps maintain the pregnancy. Once progesterone production stops, the mother's body begins to prepare for labor."}

The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for action. It increases heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. The parasympathetic nervous system helps the body relax. It slows heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing.\nThe autonomic nervous system helps the body maintain homeostasis (the ability to maintain a stable internal environment). For example, when the body's temperature rises, the autonomic nervous system will activate the sweat glands and dilate blood vessels near the surface of the skin. This helps to lower the body's temperature.\nSOLUTION: Erection of the penis or clitoris is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system has an excitatory effect on the genitals."}

But that is not the case.\nWhat the Bible does say is that sexual intimacy is to be shared only by a man and his wife. This is stated in both the Old and New Testaments.\nSo, some people believe that any sexual activity outside of marriage is a sin. This includes heterosexual acts among partners who are not married, as well as homosexual acts.\nOther people believe that the Bible's message on sexual activity is about the need for self-control, respect, and mutual love within a committed relationship. They point out that the Bible does not use the word \"homosexual\" to describe sexual orientation.\nMany religious groups today continue to discuss and discern what the Bible says about sexual orientation and the morality of sexual acts.\nSOLUTION: Roman Catholicism teaches that sexual intimacy is a gift from God to be shared between a man and his wife. For this reason, Roman Catholicism believes that it is sinful to have sexual relations outside of marriage.\nRoman Catholicism also believes that contraception is sinful. This means that Roman Catholicism teaches that it is a sin to use contraception."}

This change is often referred to as the \"new synthesis.\" The new synthesis incorporates research from fields such as comparative psychology, developmental biology, and primatology to better understand the relationships between genes and behavior.\nThe new synthesis proposes that cognitive processes, including social cognition, may be evolved adaptations that have developed to help organisms deal with their social and physical environments. This means that cognition is not just a side effect of other adaptive traits, but is an adaptive trait itself.\nSOLUTION: The new synthesis is used by sociobiologists specifically to explain the evolution of gender differences. Gender differences have evolved as a result of sexual selection, a type of social behavior that involves choosing mates. Males and females have different traits because different traits are preferred by the opposite sex. For example, male peacocks have bright tail feathers that they use to impress female peacocks. Female peacocks prefer males with the brightest, most elaborate tails. As a result, males compete with each other to grow the most impressive tails. This type of sexual selection can lead to the evolution of gender differences."}

This part of the nervous system does not need to be consciously directed. So, the vocal cords receive automatic regulatory signals that help them vibrate in a pattern that sounds like a person's voice.\nSome factors that can affect vocal cord vibration and voice production include:\nA person's gender. In females, the vocal cords are usually shorter and thicker than in males. This difference in size can produce a higher-pitched voice in females.\nA person's age. As people age, the vocal cords and other tissues in the larynx may get smaller. This can cause a person's voice to become higher.\nInjury or disease of the larynx. Injury or disease of the larynx can change the voice by changing the size or shape of the vocal cords.\nCastration. Castration is the surgical removal of the testes.

Some psychological theories that may help you understand Benny's behavior include the following:\n* Behavioral theory: Behavior is shaped by the consequences of that behavior. Benny may find that his behavior at work is effective in creating a successful corporation, and that effectiveness is reinforcing.\n* Cognitive theory: People's thoughts and actions are determined by the ways they perceive a situation. Benny may be under a great deal of pressure at work, and his masochistic behavior allows him to cope with that pressure.\n* Evolutionary theory: Behavior is shaped by genes that are designed to help survive and reproduce. Sadism and masochism are both behaviors that may have evolved because they enhanced survival and reproduction in the ancestors of modern humans.\nSOLUTION: The most likely reason Benny finds his masochistic behavior alluring is that it allows him to escape from being an autonomous, separate individual. As a child, he became sexually aroused pretending to be a powerful executive, and as an adult, he is overcome with feelings of self-doubt and his sadomasochistic behavior allows him a safe outlet for that self-doubt."}

The blood vessels are arteries, veins, and capillaries.\nArteries carry blood away from the heart.\nVeins collect blood and return it to the heart.\nCapillaries are small blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. In the capillaries, blood gives up waste and takes up oxygen and glucose.\nThe circulatory system works with the nervous system to help your body stay healthy. For example, the heart pumps blood through the vessels, and the blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to your body's cells. This can help your muscles and organs work properly.\nThe muscles in the heart are the heart's muscles. They work like other muscles in the body. However, they are under your conscious control. This means that you can decide to make your heart work harder.\nSOLUTION: The heart pumps blood through the vessels. The vessels use the heart's pumping to send the blood to the body's cells.\nWhen you are anxious, your body goes into a \"fight or flight\" response. This response is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. The fight or flight response increases your heart rate and blood pressure. It also changes the way your body uses energy.\nDuring the fight or flight response, your body needs more oxygen-rich blood to keep working. To get more blood, the heart pumps more blood into the vessels. This happens because the nervous system has directed the heart to increase its output.\nAnxiety can make it hard to relax. If you are not relaxed, the blood vessels may stay constricted. This can lower the blood flow to the upper spinal cord. The upper spinal cord helps control erectile function. So, if the spinal cord does not get enough blood, you may have trouble getting an erection."}
