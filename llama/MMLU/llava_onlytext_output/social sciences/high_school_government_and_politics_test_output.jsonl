Originally, the Republican Party was the party of Abraham Lincoln and was founded in 1854 by anti-slavery activists. It was called the Republican Party because it was the \"republican\" party, and it opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories.\nIn the late 1800s, the Republican Party shifted to a more conservative position. It supported business interests and opposed labor unions. This shift helped the Republicans to gain control of the federal government during the presidencies of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.\nHowever, the Great Depression of the 1930s caused many Americans to begin supporting the Democratic Party, which had once again become the party of anti-slavery activists. The Democratic Party gained control of the federal government under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and did so for most of the next 50 years.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the Republican Party began to change. It supported civil rights for African Americans and began to attract more women and minorities as members. This change helped the Republicans to win back many of the federal offices they had lost to the Democratic Party.\nSince the 1980s, the Republican Party has been dominated by evangelical Christians, become more antagonistic to business interests, and more influenced by labor unions.\nSOLUTION: The Republican Party has become more antagonistic to business interests."}

In a federal system, the government is divided into different levels, and no one level of government has complete control. This makes it more difficult for a single faction to gain power over the entire government.\nA federal system of government can also restrict factional political activity to the state level only. In a federal system, factions can try to influence state and local governments. But since state and local governments control only some of the government's activities, factions cannot control the entire government.\nA federal system of government does not necessarily require equal representation of all factions within the government. In a federal system, factions have equal influence within the government only if each faction has the same number of supporters. This equal representation can make it more difficult for any one faction to gain control of the government. But it does not guarantee that each faction will have a voice in the government."}

One reason is that incumbents are better known to the voters. Because they have held public office, incumbents have a record that voters can examine. This record can help incumbents raise campaign funds and attract media attention.\nAnother reason incumbents have a reelection advantage is that they can raise campaign funds more easily. Incumbents can use their positions in office to raise money from interest groups and political action committees. Challengers to incumbents, in contrast, are not allowed to use their positions in office to raise money.\nIncumbents also have a great advantage in name recognition. Many incumbents are well known in their districts, thanks to media coverage and their own campaigns. This name recognition can help incumbents get elected."}

Some critical elections are marked by major changes in the role of government, the emergence of a major new political issue, or the rise of a major political leader. The tables below show how some critical elections have contributed to the development of the United States.\n| Election | Year | Issues |\n| New Deal elections | 1932, 1934, 1936 | The United States was in the midst of the Great Depression when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president. Roosevelt's New Deal programs provided a sense of relief for Americans who were struggling. In the midterm elections of 1938, voters decided that the New Deal had gone too far, and they elected a Congress determined to scale back the government's role in people's lives. |\n| Civil War elections | 1860, 1862 | The United States was on the brink of civil war when Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860. In the summer of 1862, Lincoln urged Union soldiers to reelect their congressmen, and Lincoln's party gained seats in the midterm elections. These elections helped Lincoln establish a base of support that would help him finish the Civil War and pass the Thirteenth Amendment ending slavery. |\n| Woman suffrage elections | 1917, 1918, 1920 | Women gained the right to vote in 1920, but the issue was also up for debate in state elections during World War I. In 1917, the state of New York narrowly rejected woman suffrage. In the midterm elections of 1918, the election of pro-suffrage senators was a key victory. In 1920, the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment was the culmination of a decades-long fight. |\n| LBJ's landslide election | 1964 | In 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson won one of the largest landslides in United States history, carrying every state except for Arizona and Missouri. Johnson's victory came just four years after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Many Americans wanted to make sure that the Kennedy family would not be disrespected by Johnson, a Southern Democrat. Johnson's landslide made it clear that he was his own man. |"}

These elections may be held as often as every year."}

The legislative branch is made up of Congress. The legislative branch is one of the three parts of the federal, or national, government. The other two parts are the executive and the judicial branches.\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives are the two parts of Congress. Congress is responsible for writing the nation's laws.\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives have different roles in the government:\nThe Senate:\nThe Senate has 100 members, or senators. Each senator is elected by the people of a state.\nThe House of Representatives:\nThe House of Representatives has 435 members. They are elected by the people of their districts. The number of districts is fixed, but the population of each district is allowed to grow. This means that the size of each district, and the number of people in each district, may change after each census.\nSOLUTION: The choices are:\nThe Senate allows unlimited debate, while the House does not.\nThis is a significant difference. In the Senate, any senator can talk about a bill as long as he or she wants. In the House, there are time limits on debates.\nOnly the House may issue subpoenas.\nThis is a significant difference. A subpoena is a legal document that orders a person to appear in court or to provide evidence. In the House of Representatives, only the House can make subpoenas. But in the Senate, both the Senate and the House can issue subpoenas.\nStates are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\nThis is a significant difference. Each state has two senators. The population of each state does not determine how many senators it has. Instead, each state has two senators. The number of representatives a state has is based on its population. States with more people have more representatives.\nOnly the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\nThis is a significant difference. A revenue bill is a bill about taxes. In the Senate, only the Senate may introduce a revenue bill. But in the House, Representatives may introduce revenue bills."}

This article outlines the responsibilities of the Congress, which is the lawmaking body of the United States.\nThe Executive Branch: Article II of the Constitution explains the powers of the executive branch, or the national government. This article outlines the responsibilities of the President, or the leader of the United States.\nThe Judicial Branch: Article III of the Constitution explains the powers of the judicial branch, or the national government. This article outlines the responsibilities of the federal courts, which resolve legal disputes.\nRules of Impeachment: Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution explains the rules for impeachment. Impeachment is the process of charging an official with an offense. The Constitution lists only the crimes that can lead to impeachment.\nThe State of the Union Address: The Constitution does not mention the State of the Union address. This is a speech given by the President to the Congress. The President can choose to give this speech, and the Congress can choose to listen to the speech.\nJudicial Review: The Constitution does not explicitly mention judicial review. But the Constitution does give the federal courts the power to decide what is and is not constitutional.

The act was designed to protect the voting rights of racial minorities, and it has had a number of important effects.\nOne of the key effects of the Voting Rights Act was to increase voting participation among racial minority voters. Before the act was passed, many states had implemented voter qualification requirements that effectively disenfranchised racial minorities. For example, some states had literacy tests and other barriers in place that prevented many racial minority voters from participating in elections. But the Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned the use of such discriminatory practices, making it easier for racial minority voters to participate in the political process.\nAnother key effect of the Voting Rights Act was to prohibit states from establishing voter identification requirements. Voter identification requirements are rules that require voters to show identification before they are allowed to vote. These requirements can make it more difficult for elderly voters, low-income voters, and racial minority voters to participate in elections. But the Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned the use of such requirements, ensuring that all voters have equal access to the ballot.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 did not lower the voting age from 21 to 18. The 26th Amendment to the Constitution did that. The 26th Amendment, which was ratified in 1971, lowered the voting age from 21 to 18.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 did not establish literacy tests. Literacy tests were used in the past to prevent racial minority voters from participating in elections. But the Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned the use of such tests, ensuring that all voters have equal access to the ballot."}

When one branch oversteps its authority and takes on a power that the Constitution has assigned to another branch, that branch is violating a constitutional principle.\nThe principle of separation of powers calls for a separation of the governing powers into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The principle is designed to help ensure that each branch can check and balance the others. For example, the legislative branch makes the laws, but the executive branch can veto them. The judicial branch can interpret the laws, but the executive branch can enforce them.\nThe principle of checks and balances is part of the separation of powers. It is the idea that each branch of government has its own powers, and no one branch can take over the powers of the other branches. This way, no single branch can become too powerful.\nThe principle of vertical federalism, or states' rights, is the idea that states have their own powers, and the federal government cannot take over those powers. For example, the federal government cannot force states to do things.\nThe principle of horizontal federalism, or coordinated governments, is the idea that different branches of the federal government can work together. For example, the executive and legislative branches can work together to create laws.\nThe principle of comity is the idea that one branch of government should show respect and courtesy to other branches. For example, the judicial branch has the power to interpret laws, but it should not use that power to tell the other branches how to do their work.\nThe principle of due process of law is the idea that the government must follow certain steps when it harms people. The steps are designed to ensure that the government does not harm people without following the proper procedures.\nSOLUTION: The Constitution assigns the power to make federal regulations to the executive branch. If the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued, enforced, and adjudicated all disputes regarding a new regulation, the EPA would be taking over powers that the Constitution has assigned to the legislative and judicial branches. So, the EPA would be violating the principle of separation of powers."}

This process occurs in the United States every 10 years, following the release of census data.\nThe 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution grants state legislatures the power to set the boundaries for congressional districts. As a result, state legislatures have the authority to redraw districts.\nCongressional redistricting has significant political ramifications. The party in power in a state legislature can use redistricting to help insure that its candidates will win the large majority of districts. This can help the party maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives."}

The act did not have any specific provisions for enforcing school desegregation, but it did declare that the government would no longer accept segregation in public schools. The decision by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) said that segregation in public schools was inherently unequal. Therefore, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made segregation in public schools illegal.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not force schools to desegregate overnight. It took time for the courts to devise plans to desegregate the schools. In the 1970s and 1980s, courts ordered schools to desegregate. Some courts ordered busing to help achieve desegregation. Busing is the act of assigning students to schools outside their neighborhoods to achieve racial balance."}
