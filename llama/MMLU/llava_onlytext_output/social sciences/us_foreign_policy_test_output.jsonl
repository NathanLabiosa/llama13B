It is important to consider the costs and benefits of war, as well as the impact that war has on a nation's people. The power to declare war is known as the power to make war.\nThe United States Constitution does not have a specific provision that allows Congress to declare war. Instead, the Constitution gives Congress the power to raise and support armies and fleets. This means that Congress has the power to send soldiers and weapons into other countries. But it does not have the power to tell the president, the commander in chief, how to use the military. So, the president has some authority over the military, but Congress has some control over the president's use of the military.\nThe Constitution does have a provision that allows the United States to enter into treaties.

Understanding these theories can help you predict a state's foreign policy and explain patterns of behavior among states.\nA state's foreign policy is largely driven by the distribution of power in the international system. As power distribution affects a state's security, it is the primary determinant of a state's foreign policy.\nA state's foreign policy is also influenced by the character of a state's leader. But the behavior of a lone leader is less important than the leader's ability to reflect and continue the foreign policy of the state.\nA state's political ideology can also affect its foreign policy.

Like other forms of exchange, trade can make both parties better off. When one country trades with another country, the trade can make each country's people better off by:\nAllowing each country to specialize in the production of goods and services in which it has a comparative advantage.\nA comparative advantage is an advantage in producing a particular good or service compared with the other countries. For example, a country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if it can make the good with less labor or time than any other country.\nWhen one country specializes in the production of goods and services with a comparative advantage, it will be able to produce and sell more of these goods and services than it would if it tried to produce every good and service. This means that the country will have more goods and services to trade with other countries.\nTrading with other countries can make each country's people better off by increasing the supply of goods and services. When there are more goods and services available, people can choose which ones to buy. This means that the price of each good and service will tend to be lower, and the quality will tend to be higher.\nSOLUTION: Countries trade with each other for many reasons. One reason is to take advantage of the comparative advantages of other countries. By specializing in the production of goods and services with a comparative advantage, countries can produce and sell more of these goods and services. This will make people in each country better off.\nHowever, countries may not trade with each other for several reasons. One reason is the cost of trade. When a country trades with another country, it may have to pay to send its goods to the other country. This is called the cost of exporting. The other country may have to pay to send its goods to the first country. This is called the cost of importing. These costs can be high, and countries may not want to pay them.\nAnother reason countries may not trade with each other is international conflict. Countries may fear that trading with each other will harm their economies. For example, a country may believe that it will lose jobs to workers in other countries."}

One of the ways it did this was through the Truman Doctrine.\nThe Truman Doctrine was a statement made in 1947 by President Harry S. Truman. The doctrine led to a major increase in U.S. military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey. At the time, both countries were facing civil wars, and the United States was concerned that Communist forces would gain control.\nThe significance of the Truman Doctrine was that it marked a shift in U.S. foreign policy.

Many developing countries are heavy in oil.\nSOLUTION: Oil and other natural resource trade tends to have a negative effect on developing countries.\nWhen a country is heavily dependent on natural resource exports, it can be hurt by boom and bust cycles. A boom cycle occurs when world prices for the resource are high. A bust cycle occurs when world prices are low.\nA country like Russia that is heavily dependent on oil exports can be hurt by boom and bust cycles.\nMany developing countries are heavy in oil.

Realists argue that the international system is defined by anarchy, the absence of a central government, and that states have to protect themselves. They believe that states will always act in their own best interests.\nBecause there is no central government in the international system, states cannot rely on others to protect them. So, each state must be responsible for its own defense. This idea is known as the security dilemma.\nSome realists, such as Hans Morgenthau, argue that states are motivated by a desire to survive. They believe that each state will do whatever it takes to ensure its survival.\nOther realists, such as John Mearsheimer, argue that states are motivated by a desire to gain power. They believe that each state will do whatever it takes to become more powerful.\nSOLUTION: The fundamental difference between the international system and the domestic system is anarchy.\nIn the international system, there is no central government to enforce laws. This means that states are free to act in their own best interests. This idea is known as anarchy."}

One of the major problems that nations face when they interact is the problem of collective action and coordination. This problem arises because nations are often interested in different outcomes. For example, some nations may be interested in free trade, while others may be interested in protecting local industries. As a result, it can be difficult to coordinate policy decisions. International institutions help to solve this problem by providing a framework for negotiations and by imposing rules and sanctions.\nAnother problem that international institutions are designed to address is the problem of war. Nations can attack each other for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons are economic, some are political, and some are based on ideology. War can be extremely destructive, and it can also undermine the stability of the international system. International institutions help to reduce the risk of war by providing a framework for diplomacy and by helping to prevent disputes from escalating.\nA third problem that international institutions are designed to address is anarchy. Anarchy is the absence of a central authority that can enforce rules. Without a central authority, nations are free to do as they please. This can lead to chaos and conflict. International institutions help to mitigate the problems of anarchy by providing a framework for cooperation and by imposing rules and sanctions."}

In an international trade agreement, countries agree to alter their trade policies in specific ways. For example, countries can agree to reduce tariffs, or taxes on imports, or to implement new trade rules on issues such as intellectual property.\nInternational trade agreements can have many different mechanisms. Some agreements are based on reciprocity, or the idea that each country will do something in return for the other country. For example, the United States has a trade agreement with Canada, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was designed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In this agreement, the United States and Canada agree to trade with each other on certain terms. To put it simply, Canada will trade with the United States on the USMCA terms, and the United States will trade with Canada on the USMCA terms.\nOther agreements are based on reputational concerns, or the idea that countries will do what is needed to maintain a positive reputation. For example, countries may agree to follow certain trade rules to maintain a positive reputation as a trade partner.\nSome agreements involve side payments, or payments that countries make to each other to resolve trade disputes. For example, the EU has a trade agreement with the United States that allows the United States to export beef to the EU. As part of this agreement, the EU will pay to insure that its consumers do not face higher prices as a result of the beef export."}

One reason Lincoln was elected was that he was not from the South. Most of the presidents before Lincoln had been from the South. Many people in the South felt that Lincoln was not fair to their part of the country. One reason they felt this way was that Lincoln's political party had put into effect a law called the Missouri Compromise. This law said that any new state that was admitted to the United States would be either slave or free. Lincoln's political party had agreed to this law. But the people in the South felt that the Missouri Compromise was not fair to them. They believed that the issue of slavery should be decided on a state-by-state basis. Lincoln opposed the Southward expansion of the United States for another reason. He did not want to see slavery spread into new territories. Lincoln wanted to limit the spread of slavery. This was one of the reasons that Lincoln and the South had different ideas about how the United States should be governed."}

A grand strategy aims to determine the combination of a country's political, economic, and military goals and strategies that will best help it achieve its objectives.\nOffshore balancing is a grand strategy that seeks to maintain a balance of power among multiple great powers. To do this, an offshore-balancing country focuses on maintaining a sufficient level of military power to deter other powers from attacking, and it tries to avoid getting dragged into a conflict between other powers.\nAn isolationist grand strategy is a policy of disengagement from the international community. A country that pursues this policy may avoids entangling alliances and seeks to keep its affairs as far from other countries as possible."}

The superstructure includes a society's political and cultural institutions. The economic base includes the ways goods and services are produced and distributed.\nAccording to Marxist theory, an economy's base affects its superstructure. An economy's superstructure produces ideas and values that justify the existing economic base.\nHowever, over time, the base and superstructure can come into conflict. This conflict can lead to social change.\nSOLUTION: From a Marxist perspective, the search for new markets, or the need to find new places to sell goods and services, does not drive U.S. foreign policy.\nU.S. businesses have a good market right at home in the United States. And in the past, U.S. businesses have often found new markets by creating them. For example, many U.S. businesses have created new markets by franchising, or by setting up branches in other countries.\nEconomic protectionism is not the driving force behind U.S. foreign policy, either. The United States does not protect its own economy at the expense of other economies. Instead, the United States has encouraged free trade. Free trade is when countries do not put taxes on goods and services traded between them.\nClass consciousness does not drive U.S. foreign policy, either. Class consciousness means being aware of the ways in which social class can affect one's life. But U.S. foreign policy does not focus on social class. Instead, U.S. foreign policy is focused on matters of national security and economic interests."}

The United States is not ready to go to war just to control oil supplies.\nThe United States is not self-sufficient in oil. It needs to import oil from other countries.

One result of this dominance is that the United States has spent a larger amount of its GDP on defense than any other nation. In the past, this has led to significant increases in defense spending during wars and the buildup to wars. For example, in the decades before World War II, the United States increased its defense spending from about 1.5 percent of GDP to more than 10 percent of GDP.\nIn the decades after World War II, the United States often increased its defense spending during wars and the buildup to wars. For example, defense spending during the Vietnam War reached 10 percent of GDP. But after the war was over, defense spending declined. The same pattern held true for the Iraq War.\nSOLUTION: The general pattern for defense spending in the United States has been increased spending during wars, with demobilization bringing spending down but not back to prewar levels."}

The theory was first described in the early 1950s, and it was used to justify increased military and economic aid to states that were threatened by communism. The theory was applied to Indochina and Asia, and it became a justification for the United States' extensive involvement in the Vietnam War.\nSOLUTION: The Domino Theory was the idea that the fall of one state to communism would inexorably lead to the fall of its neighbors. This map shows how the theory was applied to Indochina and Asia.\nThe United States and many of its allies believed that if one country in a region fell to communism, the neighboring countries would follow, like dominoes falling one after another.

This strategy, known as the Monroe Doctrine, was named after President James Monroe, who announced it in 1823. The doctrine declared that the Western Hemisphere was off-limits to European colonization and extraterritorial influence. It also warned that any attempt by a European country to extend its colonial system to the Americas would be viewed as a hostile act against the United States.\nThe United States has always been a disarming blend of optimism, ambition, and naivet\u00e9 where international affairs are concerned. For much of its history, America has been the world's most powerful country, but it has also been a country with no history of imperial conquest, no standing army, and a deep-seated mistrust of foreign entanglements. In the twentieth century, the United States became the world's dominant power, and its leaders have had to adapt to new roles as preservers of a global order, rather than just as citizens of a rising power.\nTheodore Roosevelt's \"speak softly and carry a big stick\" was a reflection of American optimism and ambition. The United States would extend its influence throughout the world, but it would do so with the aim of preserving order and preventing chaos. This approach reflected the country's belief in its own idealism and its own exceptionalism.\nWoodrow Wilson's presidency coincided with the entrance of the United States into the ranks of the world's great powers. Wilson was a leader who believed in American exceptionalism and in its obligation to spread democracy and self-government to other peoples. His vision of America's role in the world would be influential in the decades that followed."}
