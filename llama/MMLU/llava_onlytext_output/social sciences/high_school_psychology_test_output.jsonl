The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. The iris is the colored part of the eye. The lens is the part of the eye that helps you focus on objects.\nWhen light enters the eye, it first hits the cornea. The cornea helps the light enter the eye. The light then passes through the pupil. The iris controls the size of the pupil.\nThe light then goes through the lens. As the lens changes shape, it focuses the light on the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the eye.\nNearsightedness results from too much curvature of the cornea and lens.\nWhen the cornea and lens have too much curvature, they prevent proper bending of light. This causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of on it. As a result, nearsighted people have trouble seeing objects that are far away.\nFarsightedness results from too little curvature of the cornea and lens.\nWhen the cornea and lens have too little curvature, they cause light to focus behind the retina instead of on it. This makes it hard to see objects that are close by."}

According to Abraham Maslow, some motives are more imperative to survival than others. Maslow's theory is known as the hierarchy of needs.\nMaslow observed that people have certain basic needs that must be met before they can fulfill higher needs. For example, people need to meet their basic physical needs\u2014such as eating, drinking, and sleeping\u2014before they can focus on higher needs such as safety and self-esteem.\nMaslow described the different levels of needs in his hierarchy:\n1. Physiological needs: The need for food, water, sleep, and other physical necessities.\n2. Safety needs: The need for safety and security.\n3. Love and belonging needs: The need for friends, family, and love.\n4. Esteem needs: The need for self-esteem and respect from others.\n5. Self-actualization needs: The need to become the best person you can be.\nSOLUTION: Maslow's hierarchy of needs approaches the motives in order of their importance to survival. This approach expresses Maslow's idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others."}

According to the psychoanalytic perspective, the unconscious mind is the source of many behaviors. People are not aware of these behaviors because they are not consciously controlled. Behaviors from the unconscious mind are revealed in dreams, and they can be changed through the process of psychoanalysis.\nCognitive perspective: This perspective focuses on the mind's ability to process information. The cognitive perspective believes that behaviors are shaped by the things that people learn and the ways that they process information. This perspective is similar to the behaviorist perspective, but it emphasizes the role of internal mental processes.\nBehaviorist perspective: This perspective focuses on the behaviors that can be observed. According to the behaviorist perspective, all behaviors are shaped by the environment. Behaviors are gained throughout a person's life. Some behaviors, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning.

This theory states that behavior is under the control of external stimuli that either reinforce or punish actions, thereby affecting the likelihood of the occurrence of these behaviors.\nPavlov noticed that dogs he had been studying would drool when they saw him come into the room. He theorized that the dogs had learned to associate the sight of him with food. Because food reinforcement was associated with the sight of him, the dogs began to drool when they saw him.\nClassical behaviorism includes several principles that describe how learning takes place. These principles include the following:\nThe principle of conditioning: Behavior is shaped by environmental stimuli.\nThe principle of reinforcement: Behavior that is reinforced is more likely to occur again.\nThe principle of stimulus control: Behavior is under the control of the environment.\nThese principles were studied by B. F. Skinner, an important figure in the development of classical behaviorism. Skinner's research involved training animals to press a lever to obtain food. He found that he could use reinforcement to shape the behavior of the animals. The animals soon pressed the lever to obtain food."}

Deinstitutionalization involves moving patients from state-run institutions to other settings, such as private homes.\nMany psychiatric patients were institutionalized in the mid-1800s and early 1900s. Institutionalization was a product of the medical model of mental illness, which sought to isolate patients from the general population.\nHowever, in the mid-1900s, the deinstitutionalization movement sought to change this. Advocates for the rights of mental patients argued that institutions trapped people in a cycle of madness and isolation.\nThe movement for the rights of the mentally ill helped change the public's attitude toward mental illness. As a result, the government and private organizations began to fund alternatives to institutionalization, such as community mental health centers.\nIn the 1960s, new medications for mental illness were developed. These medications, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, were safer and more effective than earlier drugs. This development made it possible for many patients to be treated in the community rather than in institutions.\nThe creation of new medications was a major cause of the deinstitutionalization of psychiatric patients."}

The strength of these connections affects the speed and accuracy of this communication.\nWhen two neurons are connected by a synapse, the neuron that receives the signal from the other neuron is called the postsynaptic neuron. The neuron that sends the signal across the synapse is called the presynaptic neuron.\nIn order for a postsynaptic neuron to \"read\" a signal from a presynaptic neuron, the signal must reach a threshold level. If the signal does not reach this threshold, the neuron will not \"fire,\" or send a signal of its own.\nLong-term potentiation (LTP) is a process that makes the synapse stronger. This makes it more likely that the postsynaptic neuron will reach the threshold level and \"fire.\"\nWhen a postsynaptic neuron \"fires,\" it sends a signal to the next neuron in a chain. This chain of neurons can transmit information throughout the brain."}

For example, the MMPI-2 includes a response set that says \"I deliberately set out to hurt someone\" and a response set that says \"I did something wrong, but I did not mean to hurt anyone.\" Forced-choice items make it more difficult for test takers to use their natural language to describe their symptoms.\nThe Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) is a projective test. Projective tests do not ask test takers directly about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Instead, they present test takers with pictures or stories and ask test takers to describe what is happening in the pictures or stories.\nProjective tests can be useful in personality assessment because they may reveal a test taker's unconscious thoughts and feelings.\nThe Rorschach is a projective test. It is a set of 10 inkblot cards. Test takers are asked to look at the inkblots and report what they see.\nThe WAIS-R is a cognitive assessment test. It is a standardized test that measures general cognitive ability."}

This process is called classical conditioning.\nSOLUTION: To associate a neutral stimulus with a significant stimulus, the neutral stimulus must be presented before the significant stimulus. The neutral stimulus is called the conditioned stimulus, and the significant stimulus is called the unconditioned stimulus.\nFor example, if a dog is hungry, and it smells food, it may begin to salivate. The food is the unconditioned stimulus. Its smell is the conditioned stimulus. Over time, the dog learns to salivate at the smell of food."}

According to this theory, emotions are caused by the body's physical responses to a situation. For example, when a person is hungry, their heart rate increases and their breathing quickens. They experience feelings of hunger because of these physical responses.\nThe theory that explains the relationship between emotions and social behavior is the Schachter-Singer theory. This theory states that people match their emotions to their thoughts. For example, if a person thinks a situation is funny, they are likely to experience feelings of humor.\nThe theory that explains the relationship between emotions and cognitive processes is the Cannon-Bard theory. This theory states that people's thoughts and emotions are affected by their body's physical responses to a situation. For example, when a person is startled, their heart rate increases and their thoughts are likely to become confused.\nThe theory that explains the relationship between emotions and early childhood experiences is the Erikson-Balint theory. According to this theory, people's emotions are affected by the way they interact with their caregivers. For example, a child who receives abundant care and attention is likely to develop a sense of trust.\nSOLUTION: The James-Lange theory is the most consistent with the information given. When Antoinette recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness.

Pavlov had been using a stopwatch to time his movements. He quickly realized that the drooling started when he pressed the stopwatch button. By pressing the button after he had placed the food in the dogs' dishes, Pavlov could teach the dogs to drool in response to the stopwatch button."}

These schemes, or ways of thinking, are present from the earliest period of life. As children grow and develop, they adapt and modify these schemes.\nPiaget's theory includes two major periods of cognitive development: the pre-operational period and the concrete operational period.\nThe pre-operational period includes stages of sensory-motor coordination and pre-conventional thought.\nSensory-motor coordination. This stage, which lasts from birth to around 2 years, involves the development of basic skills such as sitting up, crawling, and walking.\nPre-conventional thought. This stage, which lasts from around 2 years to around 7 years, is divided into two substages. The first substage, from 2 to 4 years, is the pre-conventional period. During this substage, children think in terms of objective reality. They learn to use language and understand that they are not the center of the world. The second substage, from 5 to 7 years, is the concrete operational period. During this substage, children learn to think in terms of other people's thoughts. They begin to understand that their own thoughts are different from other people's thoughts.\nThe concrete operational period includes a stage of concrete operations and a stage of formal operations.\nConcrete operations. This stage, which lasts from around 7 to 11 years, is characterized by the ability to think in terms of concrete objects. Children learn to think about how things actually are. They can imagine how one object is different from another.\nFormal operations. This stage, which begins during adolescence and continues throughout one's life, is characterized by the ability to think in terms of abstract ideas. People in this stage can think about moral dilemmas, theoretical questions, and other abstract concepts."}

This theory is sometimes called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, after the linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf.\nThe Whorfian hypothesis of linguistic relativity helps explain why different cultures have developed different languages. People who speak different languages think about and perceive the world around them differently. For example, different languages use different words to describe colors. This suggests that speakers of different languages perceive color differently.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nMorphemes are the smallest units of a language. A word may consist of one morpheme, or it may consist of multiple morphemes.\nA phoneme is a unit of sound that is used in a language. For example, the word chip contains two phonemes, which are represented by the symbols /c/ and /i/.\nThe word unconscious is made up of three morphemes. The first morpheme is un-, the second morpheme is conscious, and the third morpheme is -.\nThe word un- is a prefix. It means not. So, the word unconscious means not conscious.\nThe word conscious is a root morpheme. A root morpheme is a word in and of itself.\nThe word - is a suffix. It has no meaning of its own.\nThink about the difference between the words chips and unconscious. These words contain different morphemes.\nChips contains four morphemes. The first morpheme is chi, the second morpheme is p, and the third morpheme is s. The fourth morpheme is empty. It has no meaning of its own.\nUnconscious contains three morphemes. The first morpheme is un-, the second morpheme is conscious, and the third morpheme is -.\nNotice that unconscious and chips contain different morphemes. This means that these words have different meanings."}

We copy the behaviors of people we admire or love.\nExperimentation. We can also learn by experimenting with our environment. For example, a child may touch a hot stove once and then not touch it again.\nAssociation. We can also learn by associating behaviors with consequences. If we behave in a certain way and good things happen, we are more likely to behave that way in the future.\nSOLUTION: A child who is misbehaving can be grounded as a consequence. The child's behavior of misbehaving is associated with the consequence of being grounded. So, grounding a child for misbehaving is an example of negative reinforcement.

Neurotransmitters are released by neurons and attach to receptors on other neurons. This attachment sends a message from the first neuron to the second.\nSome drugs, such as marijuana and heroin, directly mimic neurotransmitters. This means that they can attach to receptors on neurons and trick the neurons into sending signals. But the drug can't match the neurotransmitter's exact shape, so the signal is distorted.\nOther drugs, such as alcohol, seem to affect neurotransmitters by blocking the normal attachment of neurotransmitters to their receptors. This can disrupt the normal communication between neurons.\nWithdrawal happens when a person who has been using a drug for a long time suddenly stops using it. The neurons that were previously affected by the drug are now signaled to send a different message: to stop working. This can cause withdrawal symptoms.\nSOLUTION: Tolerance is what happens when a person needs to use more and more of a drug to achieve the same effect. This can happen when a person uses a drug regularly.\nDissociation is a way that the brain can cope with extreme stress. During dissociation, the brain may feel detached from the body or from reality.\nActivation-synthesis is a theory that explains how the brain forms emotions. The theory holds that the brain is constantly processing information from the senses. The brain uses this information to guess what is happening in the world. Then, the brain compares this guess to the actual sensory information. The difference between the guess and the actual information is called the uncertainty. The brain releases neurotransmitters when the uncertainty is low. This causes an emotion.\nRole theory is a theory that explains how the brain forms emotions. The theory holds that the brain assigns roles to the different parts of the body. For example, the brain may assign the heart the role of sending blood through the body. When a part of the body does not follow its assigned role, the brain may release neurotransmitters to cause an emotion."}

This process is called classical conditioning because it is similar to the way in which people learn to associate food with the act of biting.\nImagine that you are hungry. You bite into a hamburger and find that it is delicious. Later, the sight of a hamburger will make you want to bite into it, even if you are not hungry. This is because the hamburger and the act of biting into it have been associated with the pleasant taste.\nClassical conditioning can also involve the association of a neutral stimulus with an unpleasant stimulus. For example, if you get a headache after drinking a particular type of soft drink, you may come to associate the sight of the soft drink with the headache. Later, the sight of the soft drink will make you feel bad, even if you are not actually drinking it. This is because the soft drink and the headache have been associated with each other.\nSOLUTION: In Pavlov's experiment, the dogs were associated with the sound of a tone. At first, the dogs salivated in response to the sight of food. Then, the sound of the tone became associated with the sight of food. So, the tone became a conditioned stimulus.\nAfter the tone had become a conditioned stimulus, the dogs started to salivate in response to the tone. This is called conditioning.

The Cannon-Bard theory of emotion explains that the body has a defense system to help people cope with situations that are dangerous or threatening.\nThe theory suggests that when the body is threatened, it sends signals to the thalamus, which is located in the center of the brain. The thalamus then sends these signals to the hippocampus, which is involved in storing memories. The hippocampus shares information with the amygdala, which is involved in processing emotions. The amygdala sends a message to the hypothalamus, which is involved in controlling body functions.\nThe hypothalamus sends a message to the medulla, which helps regulate heart rate and blood pressure. The medulla then sends a message back to the thalamus, and the cycle is complete.\nThis theory of emotion helps explain how the body can react so quickly to threatening situations. It also shows how emotions are involved in both body sensations and memory."}

Some people claim that using gender-specific language in job descriptions can affect who applies for the job.\nGender-specific language can also affect who people expect to do a job. This is called the linguistic relativity hypothesis.\nThe linguistic relativity hypothesis suggests that the language people use affects how they think about the world. For example, if a language has a word for a concept, people who speak that language are more likely to think about the world in terms of that concept. This means that people who speak a language with gender-specific job titles (such as English) are more likely to think about jobs in terms of gender.\nGender schema theory says that people have mental schemes that associate men with certain kinds of jobs and women with other kinds of jobs. When people see a job title, they use these gender schemas to decide what the job is like.\nThe social role hypothesis states that people use language to express their ideas about the world. These ideas include stereotypes. For example, people may use language to express stereotypes about what jobs men and women are good at.\nModeling is what happens when people observe and imitate the behavior of others. People learn a lot about what is considered appropriate behavior by imitating others."}

This is called classical conditioning.\nClassical conditioning can result in three types of learning:\n1. Discrimination: The ability to tell the difference between two similar stimuli.\nAfter being repeatedly presented with two similar stimuli, an organism can learn to tell the difference between them. For example, a person may learn to tell the difference between a honk from a car that is coming to a stop and a honk from a car that is speeding up.\n2. Spontaneous recovery: The return of a conditioned response after it has been extinguished.\nAfter a conditioned response has been extinguished (extinguished is explained in the next section), the response may spontaneously reoccur. For example, a person may spontaneously recover the conditioned fear of a yellow laboratory coat after being away from the laboratory for an extended period.\n3. Generalization: The transfer of a conditioned response from one stimulus to another.\nAfter an organism learns to associate a conditioned response with a specific stimulus, the organism may transfer the conditioned response to a similar stimulus. For example, a person may learn to associate a conditioned response with a particular brand of cereal and then transfer the response to a different brand of cereal that is similar in color, shape, and taste.\nSOLUTION: The dogs began to salivate whenever they heard any sound similar to a bell.

The posterior brane is made up of the parts of the brain that are in the back of the skull.\nThe occipital brane is in the back of the skull. It processes visual information.\nThe temporal branes are on the sides of the skull. The temporal brane on the left side of the skull processes visual and auditory information. The temporal brane on the right side of the skull processes visual and linguistic information.\nThe frontal brane is in the front of the skull. It is the center of the brain. The frontal brane is in charge of many functions, including problem-solving, decision-making, and social interactions.\nThe parietal brane is on the sides of the skull. The parietal brane processes sensory information, including feelings of touch and pain.\nThe temporal brane is in the center of the skull. The temporal brane is split into two parts. The left temporal brane processes language and the right temporal brane processes music and emotional responses.\nThe thalamus is in the center of the brain. The thalamus helps relay information to and from the conscious and unconscious parts of the brain.\nThe hypothalamus is below the thalamus. The hypothalamus helps control many bodily functions, such as eating, sleeping, and body temperature.\nThe pineal brane is in the center of the brain. The pineal brane produces the hormone melatonin, which helps control sleep.\nThe cerebellum is at the back of the brain. The cerebellum helps coordinate muscle movements."}

This random activity acts as a stimulus, and the mind interprets it as a dream.\nDuring the day, the brain processes a vast amount of information. Much of this information is detected by the senses and entered into the brain through the sensory organs. The rest of the information comes from the brain itself, which generates thoughts, feelings, and memories.\nThe brainstem, which is part of the brain, is responsible for generating many of the random neural activities that make up dreams. During sleep, the brainstem sends these random activities to the parts of the brain that process information.\nThe dream interpreter of the brain attempts to make sense of the random activities that are sent to it. This interpretation occurs mostly in the conscious parts of the brain, such as the neocortex."}

This response is called the fight-or-flight response.\nWhen the body is under stress, the brain's hypothalamus releases a hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH triggers the release of another hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is produced by the pituitary gland.\nACTH stimulates the release of epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine from the adrenal glands. These hormones help prepare the body to face a threat.\nEpinephrine and norepinephrine increase heart rate and blood pressure. They also increase blood sugar and alertness.\nThe fight-or-flight response is designed to be a short-term adaptation. After the crisis is over, the hormones should return to normal levels.\nSOLUTION: The best way to summarize why people tend to stay in a slightly elevated state of arousal after a crisis has occurred is that their bloodstream continues to contain elevated levels of adrenaline. After a crisis, the adrenal glands continue to secrete epinephrine, which keeps the body in an alert state."}

In operant conditioning, an organism's behavior is shaped by the consequences of that behavior.\nConsequences are what happens to an organism after he or she performs a behavior. Consequences can be rewards or punishments.\nA reward is something that an organism likes. When an organism performs a behavior and is rewarded, he or she is more likely to perform that behavior in the future.\nA punishment is something that an organism dislikes. When an organism performs a behavior and is punished, he or she is less likely to perform that behavior in the future.\nThe long-term effect of consequences is called reinforcement. Reinforcement can make a behavior more likely to occur.\nThe short-term effect of consequences is called extinction. Extinction can make a behavior less likely to occur.\nSOLUTION: A fixed ratio of reinforcement means that an organism will receive a reward after a fixed number of responses.\nFor example, if an organism receives a reward after every 10 responses, the fixed ratio of reinforcement is 10.\nWith a fixed ratio of reinforcement, the long-term effect is reinforcement. The organism will learn the behavior and continue to perform it to earn rewards.\nA variable ratio of reinforcement means that an organism does not know how many responses are needed to receive a reward.\nFor example, if an organism receives a reward after every 5 to 10 responses, the variable ratio of reinforcement is variable.\nWith a variable ratio of reinforcement, the long-term effect is reinforcement. The organism will learn the behavior and continue to perform it to earn rewards.\nA fixed schedule of reinforcement means that an organism receives a reward at each of a fixed number of intervals.\nFor example, if an organism receives a reward every 30 minutes, the fixed schedule of reinforcement is 30 minutes.\nWith a fixed schedule of reinforcement, the long-term effect is extinction. The organism will perform the behavior less often than every 30 minutes.\nA variable schedule of reinforcement means that an organism does not know how long it will be until the next reward is received.\nFor example, if an organism receives a reward every 5 to 30 minutes, the variable schedule of reinforcement is variable.\nWith a variable schedule of reinforcement, the long-term effect is reinforcement. The organism will learn the behavior and continue to perform it to earn rewards."}

When a psychologist decides to do an experiment, he must first get approval from a committee of experts. These committees are made up of scientists, health care professionals, and members of the community. The committees follow a set of rules, called a code of ethics, that set out the rules for conducting ethical experiments.\nOne of the most important rules in the code of ethics is that of informed consent. This rule states that people must be told about the experiment and what is expected of them. They must be told that they can choose to participate or not.\nAnother important rule is that of risk assessment. This rule states that the risks of the experiment must be weighed against the potential benefits. If the risks are too high, the experiment may not be done.\nA third important rule is that of voluntary participation. This rule states that people must have the freedom to choose whether or not to participate in the experiment.\nThese rules help to protect the rights of individuals. They help to make sure that experiments are conducted in an ethical manner.\nSOLUTION: The experiment described in the question would violate all three of the important rules listed above. Babies are too young to fear small animals. The experiment would also violate the rules of informed consent and risk assessment. No parent would permit a child to participate in such a study."}

A somatic therapist pays attention to how your body moves and how it feels.\nSomatic therapies can help you become more aware of your body. This awareness can help you change how you move and how you feel.\nSome somatic therapies teach you to move your body in new ways. Other somatic therapies help you learn to feel different sensations in your body.\nYour somatic therapist may ask you to change how you move or how you sit. This is so that you can learn to sense your body in a different way.\nYou might do exercises that help you connect with your body. You might also learn ways to relax your body.\nSOLUTION: A somatic therapist would use counterconditioning or systematic desensitization.\nCounterconditioning involves learning to associate a feared situation with a pleasurable experience.

The nonconscious content of the emotional state is the thoughts and feelings that are anger's underlying cause.\nTheories of hypnosis have two parts: role theory and dissociation theory.\nRole theory says that hypnosis is a form of role-playing. A person in hypnosis plays the role of a person in a hypnotic trance.\nDissociation theory says that hypnosis is a form of dissociation. Dissociation is a psychological process in which parts of the mind split off from each other. In hypnosis, parts of the mind split off from the conscious mind.\nConscious level and nonconscious level are the parts of the mind.\nThe conscious level is the part of the mind that is aware of the world and that processes information. The nonconscious level is the part of the mind that is not aware of the world and that processes information.\nCircadian rhythm and paradoxical sleep are states of the body.\nCircadian rhythm is the sleep-wake cycle of the body.\nParadoxical sleep is a stage of sleep that is important for the body to function properly.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is manifest content and latent content.\nManifest content and latent content are parts of a state.\nA hypnotic state is a state of the mind."}

Cognitive psychologists call these thought processes cognitive biases.\nCognitive biases are thoughts and behaviors that result from the ways people think about and process information. Many cognitive biases are experienced as a kind of \"mental shortcut.\" Because these shortcuts can help people make quick decisions, they are often adaptive. But they can also lead people to make errors.\nSome cognitive biases affect how people perceive information. For example, confirmation bias is the tendency to notice only information that supports one's ideas and to ignore information that contradicts them. This bias can lead people to draw false conclusions.\nOther cognitive biases affect how people process information. For example, functional fixedness is the tendency to use an object only in its usual way. This bias can prevent people from coming up with new uses for objects.\nStill, other cognitive biases affect how people remember information. For example, hindsight bias is the tendency to believe that one had known all along that a situation would turn out as it did. This bias can make people underestimate the importance of learning from their experiences.\nSOLUTION: Donia failed to use the newspaper as a makeshift umbrella because of functional fixedness.

However, the human body is not designed to keep up its metabolic rate 24 hours a day. Your body has a built-in system that helps regulate its metabolism to match the food and oxygen available.\nWhen food and oxygen are available, the body uses them to produce energy. This energy is used in two ways: to keep the body running and to keep the muscles active.\nWhen food and oxygen are in short supply, the body slows down its metabolism to conserve energy. As the body's metabolism slows down, the heart and breathing rates also slow down. This is called the resting metabolic rate.\nSo, the human body has a certain rate of metabolism, or amount of energy used in a day. This rate can change depending on the availability of food and oxygen.\nSOLUTION: The \"cocktail party phenomenon\" is an example of selective attention. When you focus on one conversation in a noisy room, your brain filters out the other conversations and sounds."}

When one neuron \"fires,\" or sends a message, it releases chemicals called neurotransmitters into the space between it and other neurons. Other neurons can detect these neurotransmitters.\nWhen a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on a nearby neuron, it sends a signal to that neuron. The neuron can then fire, too. This process is called an action potential, and it is how neurons communicate with each other.\nSOLUTION: The first sentence most accurately describes how neurons communicate:\nElectricity passes between neurons, which carries messages between one neuron and another.\nWhen a neuron fires, an electrical signal travels from the cell down the axon and out to the axon terminal. The axon terminal can release neurotransmitters onto other neurons. These neurotransmitters can bind to receptors on the nearby neuron."}

{"question": "What kinds of factors are ignored or de-emphasized when people commit the fundamental attribution error?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "dispositional"}, {"label": "B", "text": "situational"}, {"label": "C", "text": "social"}, {"label": "D", "text": "cognitive"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The fundamental attribution error is the tendency to overestimate the importance of dispositional (internal) explanations for behavior and to underestimate the importance of situational (external) explanations. This error can lead to incorrect judgments about the causes of behavior.\nFor example, suppose that a driver cuts in front of you. A dispositional explanation for this behavior is that the driver is a jerk. A situational explanation is that the driver is in a hurry.\nSOLUTION: People often make the fundamental attribution error by ignoring or de-emphasizing situational explanations for behavior.\nOne set of situational explanations involves the social context of behavior. These explanations emphasize how the situation affects people's behavior.\nFor example, a person may behave differently at work than at home. A situational explanation for this difference is that the person is in a different social context.\nAnother set of situational explanations involves the cognitive context of behavior. These explanations emphasize how people think about a situation and how that affects their behavior.\nFor example, a person may behave differently when they are told that a task is easy rather than difficult. A situational explanation for this difference is that the person's thoughts about the task affect their behavior."}

The set point is the weight at which your body thinks it should be. When you lose weight, your set point will decrease. So, your body will want to defend itself against continued weight loss.\nIn order to lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit. A calorie deficit occurs when you use more calories than you take in. To create a calorie deficit, you can eat less or exercise more.\nWhen you create a calorie deficit, your body will use stored calories to compensate for the deficit. Stored calories include the fat you see in mirrors. So, when you lose weight, your body will lose fat.\nBut your body wants to defend itself against continued weight loss. So, when you lose weight, your set point will adjust to the lower weight. This means that your body will think you should weigh less than before, but it is still a higher weight than your target weight.\nFor example, imagine that your target weight is 130 pounds. You lose weight and your body thinks that 135 pounds is your new normal weight. So, when you weigh 135 pounds, your body thinks you are at your set point.\nTo lose more weight, you need to create another calorie deficit. This means that you need to eat less or exercise more."}

This duty may arise when a client discloses a specific plan to harm a particular person or group.\nResponsibility to maintain privacy: Counselors must respect their clients' privacy and keep their clients' information confidential. They must discuss the limits of confidentiality, informing their clients about what will and will not be kept secret.\nNeed to obtain informed consent: Counselors must obtain their clients' informed consent before treating them. Informed consent is an ongoing process that involves discussing the details of the treatment and answering any questions the client may have.\nNeed to maintain accurate records: Counselors must keep accurate and complete records of their clients' treatment. They must protect their clients' records from unauthorized access and use them only for legitimate purposes."}
{"question": "A person suffering from a skin rash finds her pain is temporarily relieved by vigorous scratching. She does not perceive the pain from the rash while she is scratching, but the pain returns soon after she stops scratching. Which concept best explains this temporary pain relief?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "opponent-process theory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "amplitude and frequency theories"}, {"label": "C", "text": "transduction theory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "gate-control theory"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: The sensory system has two ways of responding to a stimulus. One way is called the 'afferent' process, or how the sensory receptor responds to the stimulus. The other way is called the 'efferent' process, or how the organism's response to the sensory input affects the stimulation of the sensory receptor.\nThe opponent-process theory explains how the afferent and efferent processes can affect each other. For some types of sensory receptors, stimulating one receptor will make other receptors less responsive. This is called opponent processing.\nThe gate-control theory applies to pain processing. It explains how one group of nerves (the 'gating' neurons) can determine whether a pain signal will reach the brain. If the gating neurons tell the pain signal to 'go away,' the person will not be aware of the pain.\nThe transduction theory explains how a sensory receptor changes a sensation into an electrical signal.\nSOLUTION: The skin rash is a stimulus. When the person scratches the rash, the efferent process occurs: The scratching helps the skin return to its normal state. This reduces the amount of sensory input from the rash. So, the person feels less pain.\nThe temporary pain relief is an example of opponent processing. The rash is a continuous stimulus. But the scratching stops the stimulus from continuing. So, the pain is temporarily relieved."}

For example, you might associate the sound of a smoke detector with the image of smoke.\nIf the smoke detector goes off when smoke is present, the sound of the smoke detector will be associated with the image of smoke. The next time you see smoke, the sound of a smoke detector will make you think about smoke.\nThis type of learning was first studied by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov.\nOperant conditioning is a type of learning in which behavior is shaped by its consequences. Behaviors that are followed by a desirable consequence are more likely to be repeated. Behaviors that are followed by an undesirable consequence are less likely to be repeated.\nOperant conditioning was developed by American psychologist B.F. Skinner.\nSOLUTION: The major difference between classical and operant conditioning is the type of behavior that is being shaped.\nClassical conditioning involves pairing a previously neutral stimulus with a stimulus that naturally triggers a response. For example, the ringing of a bell is paired with food. The next time you hear the bell, you will salivate in response to the bell.\nOperant conditioning involves shaping behavior that is followed by a consequence. For example, a person tries to find a four-leaf clover. The person will tend to look for four-leaf clovers more often in the future."}

This tendency is called homeostasis.\nHomeostasis helps maintain a stable internal environment in which cells can live and function. For example, in people, homeostasis works to keep the body's temperature at a constant level.\nWhen the body's temperature rises, blood vessels in the skin dilate. This lets more blood flow closer to the skin, where it can radiate heat. At the same time, sweat glands in the skin produce sweat. The sweat cools the skin, and the blood vessels in the skin constrict. These actions help lower the body's temperature."}

When a neuron fires, it sends an electrical signal to another neuron. An electrical signal is a brief change in voltage. Neurons cannot produce animal fat, or lipids. But they can produce their own organic molecules, called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are released by the neuron and picked up by the next neuron. This process is called neurotransmission.\nWhen a neuron is ready to fire, the voltage across its membrane will change. This voltage change is called an action potential. An action potential is a brief change in voltage that lasts for only a few milliseconds.\nAn action potential cannot become stronger as it travels along a neuron. But it can travel down a neuron's length to reach the next neuron.\nSOLUTION: A neuron can only fire if it reaches its threshold. The threshold is the voltage necessary for an action potential to occur. If the voltage across the membrane of a neuron reaches its threshold, an action potential occurs. The voltage across the membrane then returns to normal.\nThe strength of an action potential does not change as it travels along the soma. The soma is the part of a neuron that is not an extension called an axon.\nA neuron does not need to receive a neurotransmitter in order to fire. But neurotransmitters can help to temporarily increase the voltage gain of a neuron. This improvement makes it more likely that the neuron will fire.\nA neuron does not fire when the voltage across its membrane reaches hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarization is a state in which the voltage across the membrane is below the threshold for an action potential."}

When these messages are backed by research, they are called persuasive strategies.\nA persuasive strategy can use just one of the following routes, or a combination of routes:\nThe central route of persuasion: People consider the substance of the message. They weigh the pros and cons of a position and evaluate the evidence that is presented.\nThe peripheral route of persuasion: People focus on the source of the message. They may be more likely to accept a position if it comes from someone they like or respect.\nThe foot-in-the-door technique: People are exposed to a modest request, and then they are asked to make a larger request. If the larger request is based on the modest request, people are more likely to comply.\nThe mere-exposure effect: People are more likely to develop a preference for things that they are familiar with. The more someone is exposed to a political candidate, the more likely that person is to vote for that candidate.\nThe door-in-the-face technique: People are exposed to an outrageous request, and then they are asked to make a smaller request. Because the smaller request is less extreme, people are more likely to comply.\nPluralistic ignorance: People are unsure about what others think about a topic. This uncertainty can lead people to assume that their opinions are different from those of others. As a result, people may adjust their opinions to be more similar to what they think others' opinions are.\nSOLUTION: This approach uses the mere-exposure effect, a persuasive strategy that involves being exposed to something many times.\nThe more often people see \"Vote for Edy\" on cookies, the more familiar they become with the slogan. The more familiar they become, the more likely they are to vote for Edy."}

They can be useful in helping to understand a variety of health issues.\nA case study may be described as a snapshot of an individual's health at a particular point in time. As with a photograph, a case study shows where the person is at a specific point in time. But unlike a photograph, a case study shows what the person is going through and how they are changing.\nUnlike experimental studies, which can involve many people, case studies typically involve one or a few individuals. This means that case studies can provide a lot of detail about an individual's health. But case studies are not as generalizable as experimental studies.

It is called an action potential because it is a rapid change in the electrical charge across a cell's membrane.\nAn action potential involves the movement of sodium ions into the cell. When sodium ions enter the cell, the electrical charge across the cell's membrane changes. This change is called a depolarization.\nAfter the sodium ions enter the cell, potassium ions leave the cell. This movement of potassium ions out of the cell repolarizes the cell's membrane. The repolarization prevents the action potential from becoming even larger and depleting the cell of energy.\nSOLUTION: An action potential involves the movement of sodium ions into the axon. This can be determined by looking at the first step in an action potential. When a nerve cell is stimulated, it moves more sodium ions into the axon."}

It is a score that compares a person's test performance to that of other people the same age.\nAn IQ score has two parts: a verbal score and a performance score. The verbal score shows a person's abilities with words. The performance score shows a person's abilities in problem-solving.\nIQ scores are standardized. This means that the scores have a mean (average) of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This standardization helps to compare IQ scores between people.\nSOLUTION: The key to understanding the definition of IQ is the formula IQ = mental age/chronological age \u00d7 100.\nMental age represents a person's abilities compared to other people the same age. Chronological age represents a person's age.\nIf a person's mental age is higher than their chronological age, it means that the person is experiencing a higher level of cognitive function. So, the formula shows that the person's IQ is higher than 100.\nIf a person's mental age is lower than their chronological age, it means that the person is experiencing a lower level of cognitive function. So, the formula shows that the person's IQ is lower than 100."}

For example, the taste of water does not change even though the taste of salt is present.\nSensory adaptation is the process of adjusting to a constant stimulus. The brain stops noticing a constant stimulus that is below the absolute threshold.\nSOLUTION: The goal of the study was to establish that most people can taste one gram of salt in one quart of water. The concentration of salt in this case is below the absolute threshold. The brain does not notice the salt. So, the study established that people have a taste constancy for salt."}

An impulse cannot be transmitted across a synapse, or junction, between two neurons.\nWhen an impulse reaches the end of an afferent neuron, it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit impulses across synapses. The neurotransmitter fits into receptors on the opposite neuron, the efferent neuron.\nWhen the neurotransmitter fits into its receptor, an impulse is triggered in the efferent neuron. This impulse travels back toward the brain.\nSOLUTION: An impulse travels from the receptor, through an afferent neuron, to an interneuron, and then to an efferent neuron. The efferent neuron carries the impulse to the effector.\nThe effector is the effector of the impulse. The effector can be a muscle or a gland."}

This image can be upright or inverted, depending on how the object is shaped.\nDepth perception allows you to judge how far away an object is. You can achieve depth perception by using your two eyes. Your brain compares the images seen by each eye. If the images are different, your brain can figure out how the object is located in space.\nTo use motion parallax for depth perception, you must be able to see objects that are different distances away. This works best when you are looking at a nearby object and a much more distant object.\nImagine looking at a nearby tree and a distant mountain. The tree will move more than the mountain when you turn your head. By watching this movement, your brain can tell how far away the tree is in relation to the mountain.\nSOLUTION: The statue does not change position. So, the retinal images of the statue do not change. But the eye is much closer to the statue than is the museum room. So, the observer's visual experience is different for the different retinal images.\nFor the museum to appear closer to the statue than to you, the museum must come between the statue and you. But the museum is not between the statue and you. So, the museum cannot be closer to the statue than to you. This means that the statue is larger than the museum."}

Our emotions are an important part of how we understand the world and how we behave. Emotions are feelings that come from within. They can change how we think, how we behave, and how our body feels.\nTwo factors are involved in every emotional experience. These factors are the nature of the emotional content and the cognitive appraisal of that content.\nThe nature of the emotional content refers to the events in the world around you that trigger an emotional response. Some content has an obvious emotional quality, such as the presence of a dangerous predator. Other content is less obvious, but it can still trigger an emotional response. For example, the sight of a dangerous predator's droppings might trigger a response.\nThe cognitive appraisal of that content refers to the interpretation of the emotional content. This interpretation can affect how strongly the emotion is experienced. For example, the same situation experienced as a challenge will be experienced with less intense emotions than the same situation experienced as a threat.\nStanley Schacter's two-factor theory of emotion explains that each emotional experience involves a combination of psychological changes and cognitive interpretations. This theory states that each person follows a predictable pattern of changes in response to stress, including alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.\nSOLUTION: According to the two-factor theory, an external event causes us to experience a specific emotion, and this emotion triggers certain physiological changes to occur. These changes include the body's response to the stress of the situation."}

The JND is different for each sense modality and depends on the individual observer.\nThe just-noticeable difference is determined by the sensory system's sensitivity and the frequency of the existing stimulus. For a visual stimulus, the JND is about 1% of the intensity of the existing stimulus. For an auditory stimulus, the JND is about 1 decibel (dB) of intensity. For a tactile stimulus, the JND is about 1 micro-meter of distance.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is B. The initial determination of the absolute threshold and the variation of the difference threshold are the key factors that determine the JND.\nThe absolute threshold is the intensity or distance of a stimulus below which the stimulus is not perceived. The difference threshold is the difference in intensity or distance between a stimulus and a just-noticeable difference below which the stimulus is not perceived.\nBoth the absolute threshold and the difference threshold depend on the sensory system's sensitivity and the frequency of the existing stimulus."}

These two processes are used to change the behavior of both human and animal students.\nClassical conditioning is a process that happens when a behavior is automatically followed by a pleasing stimulus. This association creates an automatic response to the stimulus. Over time, the response can be conditioned to other stimuli that are similar to the original pleasing stimulus.\nOperant conditioning is a process that happens when a behavior is followed by a consequence. The type of consequence can affect the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated.\nNegative reinforcement is used to decrease the frequency of an undesirable behavior. The behavior is followed by the removal of an unpleasant stimulus.\nPositive reinforcement is used to increase the frequency of a desirable behavior. The behavior is followed by the addition of a pleasing stimulus.\nPunishment is used to decrease the frequency of a behavior. The behavior is followed by an aversive stimulus.\nThese definitions describe the ways in which behaviorists use classical conditioning and operant conditioning to change behavior. They do not describe the ways in which these processes change the brain.\nSOLUTION: The major difference between negative reinforcement and punishment is that negative reinforcement is used to increase the frequency of a behavior, and punishment is used to decrease the frequency of a behavior.\nWhen a behavior is followed by a pleasing stimulus, the behavior is more likely to be repeated. This is known as positive reinforcement. When a behavior is followed by the removal of an unpleasant stimulus, the behavior is more likely to be repeated. This is known as negative reinforcement.\nPunishment does not increase the frequency of a behavior. Punishment does not follow a behavior and a pleasing stimulus. So, punishment is used to decrease the frequency of a behavior."}

These parts include your eyes, optic nerves, optic chiasm, optic tracts, and visual cortex.\nThe cells in the retina, called photoreceptors, detect the light that enters your eye. The photoreceptors send their signals to the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the signals to the optic chiasm.\nThe optic chiasm is a part of the brain where the signals from the left and right eyes cross over. This is called decussation. After the signals cross over in the optic chiasm, they go to the opposite sides of the brain along the optic tracts.\nFinally, the signals reach the primary visual cortex, which is at the back of the brain. The primary visual cortex is responsible for processing the visual information and sending it to other parts of the brain.\nSOLUTION: The nodes of Ranvier have not yet formed.\nThe nodes of Ranvier are gaps in an axon. The gaps increase the length of the axon, but they also slow the signal. This slowing is good, because it helps the signal travel farther without being lost.\nBabies have poor vision for the first few weeks of life because the nodes of Ranvier have not yet formed in the axons of the neurons in their visual system."}

A test is said to be reliable if it produces the same results on different occasions.\nThere are several ways to measure reliability:\nTest-retest reliability: This type of reliability is determined by administering the same test to the same group of people on two different occasions and seeing if the results are the same.\nInternal consistency reliability: This type of reliability is determined by examining the results of a test to see if they are consistent with each other.\nInter-rater reliability: This type of reliability is determined by examining the results of a test administered by different raters to see if they are consistent with each other.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether the personality test has low test-retest reliability, calculate the test-retest reliability of the test.\nThe test-retest reliability of a test is determined by administering the same test to the same group of people on two different occasions and seeing if the results are the same.\nIf the results are very consistent, the test has high test-retest reliability.\nIf the results are not very consistent, the test has low test-retest reliability.\nThe test-retest reliability of a test can be calculated in two ways:\nCorrelation, r: The correlation calculates the strength of the relationship between the two sets of test results. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect relationship, and a correlation of 0 indicates no relationship.\nFor example, if the correlation between two sets of test results is +0.8, that indicates a strong relationship between the two sets of results.\nMean difference: The mean difference is the difference between the two sets of test results. A mean difference of 0 indicates that the two sets of results are the same.\nFor example, if the mean difference between two sets of test results is 2, that indicates the second set of results is, on average, 2 larger than the first set of results.\nThe test-retest reliability of a test can also be described as high, moderate, or low. These descriptions are based on the value of the correlation, r, or the mean difference.\nA correlation of +0.8 or higher indicates high test-retest reliability.\nA correlation of +0.4 to +0.8 indicates moderate test-retest reliability.\nA correlation of +0.4 or lower indicates low test-retest reliability.\nA mean difference of 0 or lower indicates high test-retest reliability.\nA mean difference of +1 to +0.4 indicates moderate test-retest reliability.\nA mean difference of +0.3 or lower indicates low test-retest reliability."}
