This is a point of equal margins.\nMarginal revenue is the change in revenue that results from changing the quantity sold by one unit. Marginal cost is the change in cost that results from changing the quantity produced or sold by one unit.\nAt the point of equal margins, the firm is generating revenue just to cover its costs. It is not generating profit.\nSOLUTION: To decide if marginal revenue equals marginal cost at the point where total revenue is equal to total cost, look at the quantities.\nWhen total revenue is equal to total cost, the total product is at its highest point. The total product is the total quantity of a good or service that is produced.\nSo, marginal revenue must equal marginal cost at the point where the total product is at its highest point."}

In an oligopoly, each firm has a relatively large market share. The demand curve facing an oligopolist is highly sensitive to the actions of other firms. This is because each firm is interdependent with other firms in the market.\nIf rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase, the demand curve facing an oligopolist will be highly elastic. This is because the price decrease will lead to a decrease in the demand curve. But since the other firms do not increase their prices, the oligopolist is following a lower-priced strategy.\nSo, the demand curve facing the oligopolist consists of two discontinuous segments.

It occurs when markets do not produce an efficient outcome.\nImperfect competition occurs when many of the firms in a market have some market power. This can result in a market that is not perfectly competitive, which can lead to inefficiencies.\nExternalities are costs or benefits that are not reflected in the prices of goods and services. When externalities are present, the prices of goods and services do not reflect their real costs or benefits, and the market will produce an inefficient outcome.\nPublic goods are goods that are both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable means that it is impossible to exclude people from using the good. Non-rivalrous means that one person's use of the good does not reduce its availability to others. Since public goods are both non-excludable and non-rivalrous, they are underprovided by the market.\nImperfect information refers to situations in which some parties have better information than other parties. This can make prices incorrect and lead to inefficiencies.\nSOLUTION: Market failure is the result of imperfect competition, externalities, public goods, or imperfect information. In the absence of intervention, these issues will always lead to market failure.\nWhen demand curves are not vertical, the market has not reached the optimal quantity of output. This is a result of either a movement along the demand curve (a change in quantity demanded at a constant price) or a change in the demand curve (a change in price or quantity demanded).\nWhen prices are too low, the market is selling too much of the good. This is a result of a downward sloping demand curve.\nWhen quantities of output are too high, the market is selling too much of the good. This is a result of a positive slope on the demand curve."}

The production of goods and services has both benefits and costs.\nBenefits: The benefits of producing a good or service are the advantages of consuming it. These benefits may include filling a need or want, creating jobs, and generating wealth.\nCosts: The costs of producing a good or service are the expenses incurred in making it. These costs may include the cost of the materials used to make the good or provide the service, the wages paid to workers, and the cost of renting or using equipment.\nExternalities: Some costs and benefits of producing a good or service are external to the producer and consumer. An externality is a cost or benefit that is not paid by the consumer but is imposed on or received by a party who is not involved in the exchange.\nFor example, the production of a good or service may impose external costs on others. For example, the pollution produced by a factory imposed an external cost on the environment and on the people who live nearby.\nAn externality may also be a benefit that is not received by the producer. For example, a research scientist who discovers a new drug may receive a benefit from the externality of increased sales.\nSOLUTION: When a negative externality exists as the result of the production of a good, the socially optimal quantity of output could be achieved by placing limits on the quantity that can be produced.\nThe graph shows the socially optimal quantity of output, which is where the producer's marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of the externality. In this case, the marginal cost of the externality is greater than zero, so the socially optimal quantity of output is less than the quantity that would be produced under a free market.\nBy placing limits on the quantity that can be produced, the external cost is reduced to its social cost. The social cost of the externality is the cost that is imposed on others."}

A firm will choose to produce a certain level of output if the benefit from producing that much output is equal to or greater than the cost.\nA firm's benefit is the revenue it receives from selling its output. A firm's cost is the cost of the input it uses to produce its output.\nThere are two types of costs that a firm can incur: variable costs and fixed costs.\nVariable costs increase as output increases. For example, the cost of raw materials may increase as a firm produces more output.\nFixed costs do not change as output increases. For example, the rent a firm pays for its factory does not change, regardless of how much output the firm produces.\nSOLUTION: To decide if Jason should shut down in the short run, look at the total costs and total revenue.\nJason's total variable costs are $80. His total fixed costs are $20. So, Jason's total costs are $100.\nJason's total revenue is $10 per pool. If he cleans 9 pools, his total revenue will be $100.\nJason should clean 9 pools per day. It will cost him $100 to do this, but he will earn $100 by doing so. So, Jason will not incur economic losses."}

Producers are better off because they can earn a profit by selling goods and services at the same price that they pay for the factors of production. The economy is better off because resources are used more efficiently.\nSOLUTION: In a competitive market, the total welfare is maximized, and the difference between consumer and producer surplus is maximized. Consumer surplus is the difference between the amount of money that consumers are willing to pay for a good or service and the price that they actually pay. Producer surplus is the difference between the price that producers receive for a good or service and the price that they pay for the factors of production.\nWhen the market is perfectly competitive, consumer surplus is maximized, and producer surplus is minimized.

As the amount of an input is increased while the other inputs are held constant, the marginal return from the input will eventually decrease.\nThe marginal return is the increase in output from an additional unit of input. For example, the marginal return from an additional unit of labor is the increase in output from the additional labor.\nThe law of diminishing marginal returns says that the marginal return to an input will decrease as the output increases. This happens because at some point, the addition of more inputs will start to increase the time it takes to produce each additional unit of output.\nFor example, consider a bakery that produces bread. Adding more labor to the mixing process will increase the number of loaves of bread that can be produced. However, if the bakery has too many employees mixing dough, communication among the workers will break down, and the bakery's output will decrease. In this case, the marginal return from an additional unit of labor decreases.\nSOLUTION: The law of diminishing marginal returns is responsible for the AVC that first rises, but eventually falls, as output increases.\nAs a farm grows, its average total cost (AVC) will increase because the farm is using more inputs. However, at some point, the farm will reach the point of diminishing marginal returns. The marginal return to an additional input will decrease, and the AVC will start to rise more slowly. At this point, the AVC will have reached its highest point and will start to fall."}

This means that in the long run, every input to an economy is able to adjust. When input prices change, the quantity demanded of each input will move to a new price equilibrium. The table below shows how changes in input prices affect the quantity demanded of an input.\nPrice | Quantity demanded\n$ | 1\n5 | 2\n10 | 4\nThe table shows that when the price of an input doubles, the quantity demanded is cut in half. This is because the input is used in producing a good or service that is sold for a price that is double the price of the input. The demand for the input will not support a price that is higher than the price of the good or service.\nWhen input prices do not change, the long run can be used to analyze how an economy adjusts to a change in the quantity of inputs. For example, an economy can adjust to a change in the quantity of labor by investing in new labor-saving technology. Eventually, the economy will settle into a new equilibrium with a different quantity of labor and a different price of labor.\nSOLUTION: In the long run, this production process is increasing returns to scale. With increasing returns to scale, the quantity of labor used in production increases and the price of the output falls.\nThe table below shows how the quantity of labor affects the price of the output.\nQuantity of labor | Price of output\n1 | 300\n2 | 350\n3 | 375\nThe table shows that as the quantity of labor increases, the price of the output falls. This is because each additional unit of labor is increasing the rate at which the output is produced.\nWith long run increasing returns to scale, the price of the input will not rise as the quantity of inputs is increased. This is because the higher quantity of inputs will be used to produce a larger quantity of output. So, the price of the output will fall, but the price of the input will not rise."}

This is the output level at which the monopoly covers all its costs and sets a fair price for the product. At this level, the monopoly is producing the most output that it can while keeping costs low.\nIf the monopoly produces less output, the cost to produce each unit is higher, and the price charged to consumers is also higher.

If the price of a substitute good changes, the demand for a complementary good will also change.\nA complement is a good that is used in conjunction with another good. In the presence of a complement, the demand for the complement is related to the price of the substitute and the quantity of the complement needed to use the substitute.\nThus, if the price of a substitute good rises, the demand for the complement will decrease. The quantity of the complement needed to use the substitute has not changed, but the complement is now more expensive. So, the quantity of the complement demanded will decrease.\nA substitute is a good that can be used in place of another good. In the presence of a substitute, the demand for the original good is related to the price of the substitute and the quantity of the substitute needed to use the original good.\nThus, if the price of a substitute good rises, the demand for the original good will increase. The quantity of the original good needed to use the substitute has not changed, but the substitute is now more expensive. So, the quantity of the original good demanded will increase.\nSOLUTION: The price of polyester pants, a substitute for denim jeans, has risen. In the jean market, the demand for denim jeans will increase. The price of denim jeans has not changed, but denim jeans are now cheaper compared to polyester pants. So, the quantity of denim jeans demanded will increase.\nThe quantity of denim jeans supplied will also increase. The higher price of denim jeans has made it more profitable to produce and sell denim jeans."}

An individual will choose to consume a certain quantity of a good if the marginal utility of that quantity is greater than the marginal utility of any other quantity.\nIn the short run, the quantity of a good that an individual chooses to consume is determined by its relative price. The relative price of a good is the amount of money that the individual must give up to buy one more unit of the good.\nIf the relative price of a good changes, the quantity of the good that an individual chooses to consume will change until the marginal utility of the additional unit is equal to the relative price of the good. This shows that the quantity of a good that an individual chooses to consume is determined by other factors, such as the good's scarcity and the individual's income.\nSOLUTION: To determine which good is likely to provide both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility, look for the good with the highest total utility and the lowest relative price.\nThe choice is between air and computers. The total utility that an individual experiences from consuming air is equal to the quantity of air that they consume.

In the long run, firms in monopolistic competition can earn abnormal profits. Since they are easy to enter, firms have no incentive to leave, so the market remains stable.\nMonopolistically competitive firms may choose to produce at a level that maximizes their profits. In the long run, this choice leads to a market outcome where the price is above the minimum average total cost.

The price is forced down because the buyer has to bid against many sellers to get the quantity it wants to buy.\nSOLUTION: In a monopsony, the single buyer pays less and hires more. The single buyer can set a lower price, and many sellers will bid against each other to sell their goods at this price. This drives the wage down. But the quantity of labor that the single buyer is willing to hire increases because the lower wage makes hiring more labor attractive."}

The market is considered a \"perfect\" competition because there are so many sellers that no single seller can affect the price of the product. The price is instead determined by the market as a whole.\nSOLUTION: If corn is produced in a perfectly competitive market and the government placed a price ceiling above equilibrium, the price of corn would be above the equilibrium price. But the price ceiling puts a limit on the price that can be charged. So, the amount of corn supplied would be greater than the amount demanded.\nWhen the amount supplied is greater than the amount demanded, the market has a surplus of corn. In this case, the producers of corn would lose revenue due to the decreased price."}

For example, people can produce goods like cars, computers, and clothing, and they can consume services like haircuts, hospital care, and education.\nThe types of goods and services that people produce and consume are called production possibilities. The production possibilities can be represented by a production possibilities frontier. The production possibilities frontier is a set of points that shows the combinations of two goods that an economy can produce.\nThe production possibilities frontier is not a single curve. It is a polygon that is formed by the combination of two lines. The two lines represent the production of one good and the production of another good, respectively. The point at which the two lines meet is the corner of the polygon.\nThe production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin. This means that the curve is concave, or bowed inward, from the perspective of the origin. This bowed-in shape shows that, in the short run, an economy can produce more of both goods by specializing in one good and importing the other good.\nHowever, the production possibilities frontier is not concave to the origin in the long run. This means that, in the long run, an economy can produce more of both goods by investing in the industries that produce those goods. When the economy invests in the industries, the production possibilities frontier becomes a curve that is concave to the origin.\nSOLUTION: The production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin because of the law of increasing costs. This means that the curve is concave, or bowed inward, from the origin. When an economy specializes in producing one good or the other, the production possibilities frontier becomes a curve that is concave to the origin.\nThis statement is positive. It shows that an economy should specialize in producing both goods, because the production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin.\nThe other answer choices are not positive. They show that an economy should specialize in producing only one good, because the production possibilities frontier is a straight line. A straight line is not concave to the origin."}

But this higher price is also the price that consumers will be willing to pay for a lower quantity of the product. So, the monopolist will end up with unsold inventory and an opportunity cost equal to the revenue that it could have earned at the lower price.\nIf the monopolist sets the price lower, it will create short-run profit. But this short-run profit will be eliminated through the long-run entry of new firms.\nWhen a monopolist creates short-run profit by setting the price below the competitive level, new firms will enter the market to take advantage of the higher price. In the long run, the industry will become competitive, and the monopolist will earn only normal profit."}

Consumer surplus is a measure of the value consumers receive from a good or service.\nThe graph below shows the relationship between the quantity of a good and the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for that quantity. The area inside the curve is the consumer surplus.\nThe curve shows the quantity of the good that consumers are willing to purchase at different prices. When the price is lower, consumers are willing to purchase a larger quantity. At each price, the curve is tangent to the quantity demand curve, which shows the quantity of the good that consumers are willing to purchase at that price.\nThe area inside the curve is the consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the amount they actually have to pay.

For example, an airline may charge different prices to different people for a flight. One person may pay a lower price because they are a student, a senior citizen, or a member of the military.\nBut in a monopoly, price discrimination is a form of price exploitation. Because a monopoly is the only seller of a good or service in a market, it can set the price and exploit certain customers.\nFor example, a monopoly may charge higher prices to customers who have a necessary but rare skill, such as a taxi driver who knows how to navigate a downtown area. Or, a monopoly may charge lower prices to customers who are less able to compare prices, such as elderly customers.\nSOLUTION: When the opportunity for price discrimination arises, market segments with relatively elastic demand pay higher prices.\nA monopoly can charge higher prices to market segments with relatively elastic demand because these market segments are not as sensitive to price. For example, if a good or service is a luxury, or nonessential, market segments with relatively elastic demand will pay higher prices."}

In other words, businesses want to have a profit.\nThe price at which a good or service is sold is called the selling price. The cost to a business of making a good or service is called the cost.\nProfit is the difference between the selling price and the cost. If a business is able to sell a good or service for more than it costs the business to make, then the business makes a profit.\nThere are many factors that businesses consider when setting prices and costs. One of the factors is price elasticity of demand.\nPrice elasticity of demand is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good or service changes in response to a change in its price.\nIf a good or service is price elastic, then the quantity demanded changes a lot in response to a change in price. The table below shows how price elasticity of demand is measured.\n | Price elasticity of demand | Quantity demanded |\n'More elastic' | Less than 1 | Less is demanded.\n'Less elastic' | Between 1 and 2 | More is demanded.\n'Most elastic' | Greater than 2 | The most demanded.\nA change in price also affects a business's total revenue. Total revenue is the selling price times the quantity demanded. So, if the price changes, the total revenue also changes.\nSOLUTION: Price times quantity measures is the price at which a good or service is sold times the quantity demanded.\nThe international trade gap is the amount of money that a country spends on imported goods and services more than the money that it earns from selling exports. This measure is different from price times quantity measures.\nThe budget deficit is the amount by which the government spends more money than it takes in through taxes and other revenue.

When there is a positive externality associated with the production of a private good, one important tool is to subsidize the firm or its customers. Doing so can increase the quantity of the good that is produced and consumed.\nA subsidy is a payment by the government to a producer or consumer. Subsidies can increase the quantity of goods that are produced and consumed. For example, a subsidy to a firm that is developing a new technology can help the firm cover some of its costs. The subsidy makes it easier for the firm to produce the new technology. After the new technology is produced, the firm may produce and sell the technology at a lower price than it would have without the subsidy. This lower price makes it cheaper for consumers to buy the technology. As a result, consumers buy more of the technology than they would have before the subsidy.\nA tax is a payment that a government collects from a producer or consumer. Taxes can decrease the quantity of goods that are produced and consumed. For example, a tax on gasoline makes gasoline more expensive. As a result, some people buy less gasoline than they would have before the tax.\nA commission is a group of people who are appointed to study a problem and make recommendations. A commission can investigate what is causing a problem and can make recommendations to a government on how to solve the problem.\nSOLUTION: To move the market to an efficient outcome, the government can subsidize the firm or its customers. Doing so increases the quantity of the good that is produced and consumed. The efficient quantity is the quantity that sets the external benefit equal to the external cost.\nWhen the firm is subsidized, the firm's customers are also subsidized. The customers pay a lower price for the good than they would have without the subsidy. This lower price makes the good cheaper for consumers.

The following variables are important to price elasticity of demand:\nThe proportion of the good of the consumer's budget: If a good is a large proportion of the consumer's budget, then a change in price will have a greater impact on the consumer's spending. So, the price elasticity of demand is greater when a good is a larger proportion of the consumer's budget.\nThe period of time to respond to a price change is short: If it takes less time to respond to a price change, consumers will be more responsive to the change.

When a benefit is shared, no one wants to bear the entire cost. So, people will pay for a benefit only if they have to. If someone else will pay for the benefit, then it is in their best interest to free-ride.\nThe free-rider effect is the tendency of people to choose to free-ride when they can. This effect occurs in both public goods and common resources situations.\nA public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable means that it is impossible to keep people from using the good. Non-rivalrous means that one person's use of the good does not decrease the amount of the good available for other people to use.\nA common resource is a resource that is both rivalrous and excludable. Rivalrous means that each person's use of the resource decreases the amount of the resource available for other people to use. Excludable means that it is possible to keep people from using the resource.\nThe free-rider effect occurs with public goods and common resources. If someone is willing to pay for a public good or common resource, but other people can free-ride on that payment, then those people will do so."}

When the cost of a negative externality is not paid by the people who incur that cost, the outcome is an overuse of the good or service.\nFor example, when a factory dumps its waste into a river, it does not have to pay the cost of the pollution. But the river may become unusable, which can harm the community. The factory's owners do not have an incentive to decrease their waste because they do not have to pay the cost of that waste.\nSOLUTION: The best answer is D. Air pollution from a power plant is a negative externality. The pollution is a cost that is not reflected in the price of the electricity. The electricity producer does not have an incentive to decrease the air pollution because it does not have to pay the cost of that pollution.\nA tax on the production of electricity is an appropriate plan for eliminating the negative externality. By adding to the price of electricity, the tax sends a signal to electricity producers to decrease the air pollution."}

A monopoly can produce an efficient quantity, but in doing so, it will produce at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. At this quantity, the monopoly breaks even.\nA monopoly that produces at an allocatively efficient quantity will produce at the minimum point of its average total cost curve. This is the smallest quantity for which the monopoly can break even. To produce at this quantity, the monopoly must sell its output at a price that covers its total cost.\nAt an allocatively efficient quantity, the monopoly will make an economic profit if the price is above the average total cost.

The supply curve slopes upward, which means that when the price of a good or service goes up, the quantity that producers make and sell goes up as well. This happens because producers are willing to sell more of a good or service when they can get a higher price.\nAs the price of a good or service changes, the quantity that consumers want to buy also changes. This change in quantity demanded is represented by a demand curve. The demand curve slopes downward, which means that when the price of a good or service goes up, the quantity that consumers want to buy goes down.\nA change in one of the other curves will cause the supply curve to shift. For example, if the cost of producing a good or service goes down, the supply curve will shift upward. If the price of a good or service changes, the demand curve will shift. The shift will happen in the direction that keeps the supply curve equal to the demand curve.\nSOLUTION: The supply curve for lawn-mowing services is likely to slope upward because of increasing opportunity cost of time. The opportunity cost of time is the value of the time that producers give up to produce a good or service. As the price of lawn-mowing services goes up, producers are willing to spend more time mowing lawns. This increases the quantity of lawn-mowing services that producers make and sell.

In a monopoly, the seller sets the price and the quantity.\nTo understand how a monopoly prices its product, consider a simplified version of a monopoly. Imagine that there is one company that sells a single brand of ice cream. The company can decide how many gallons of ice cream to sell and how much to charge.\nTo find the price that will be most profitable for the ice cream company, the company will consider the demand for the ice cream. The demand for the ice cream is shown by the curve in the picture. The curve shows how many gallons of ice cream the company can sell at each possible price.\nThe price that the company charges for the ice cream will be at the intersection of the company's demand curve and the total cost curve. This is shown by the red dot on the graph.\nWhen the price is $4.00, the company can sell 10 gallons of ice cream. The company's total cost is $3.00 per gallon. So, the company's profit is $1.00 per gallon.\nThe measure of the company's pricing power is the distance between the demand curve and the total cost curve. This distance is shown by the area above the total cost curve and below the demand curve.\nSo, the larger the area, the more the company can charge above the minimum price needed to cover its costs. The larger the value of the index, the greater the company's market pricing power.\nSOLUTION: To find the firm's market pricing power, look at the ratio of the difference between the price and the marginal cost to the price.\nThe marginal cost is the cost of the last unit produced.\nThe formula for the measure of the firm's market pricing power is (P - MC)/P.\nThis formula tells you how much the firm can charge above the minimum price needed to cover its costs.\nThe larger the value of the formula, the greater the firm's market pricing power."}

The price of the product is determined by the market, and each firm sells as much as it can at that price.\nBecause there are many firms in a perfectly competitive market, no one firm can influence the price. Each firm is a price taker, and each must accept the going price. The fact that the price is determined by the market means that each firm faces a market-determined price.\nThe market-determined price is also the average price paid by all buyers in the market. At this price, the total revenue received by all firms equals the total cost paid by all firms.

A monopoly can control the price of its product or service, and in doing so, it can charge more than in a competitive market.\nA monopoly can make a larger profit than in a competitive market. But, a monopoly can also charge a higher price. This higher price will cause the quantity demanded to be less than the quantity supplied. The monopoly will end up with a deadweight loss.\nIn a monopolistic competition, there are many sellers of a product or service. Each seller can set its own price. The price charges by each seller will impact the quantity demanded. If one seller raises its price, it will decrease the quantity demanded. But other sellers can lower their prices to compete for sales.\nSo, in a monopolistic competition, each seller faces a downward-sloping demand curve. This curve shows the relationship between the price a seller charges and the quantity demanded.\nA monopoly has a upward-sloping demand curve. This curve shows the relationship between the price a seller charges and the quantity demanded. The high price is the result of the seller being able to charge more in a monopoly than in a competitive market.\nAn oligopoly is a market with a few sellers. Oligopoly firms can interact with each other. They can form cartels to set prices. But oligopoly firms can also compete with each other.\nAn oligopoly has a downward-sloping demand curve. This curve shows the relationship between the price a seller charges and the quantity demanded. The high price is the result of the seller being able to charge more in a monopoly than in a competitive market.\nSOLUTION: Deadweight loss occurs in a monopoly. In a monopoly, the monopolist sets a price equal to the marginal cost. In doing so, the monopolist ignores the social cost of the good or service it provides. This social cost is the area inside the marginal cost curve and below the competitive price.\nThis social cost is the deadweight loss. The monopolist and consumers are both better off when the monopolist charges the competitive price. The competitive price is the price that maximizes the monopolist's profit and equals the competitive price."}

One important concept is that a profit-maximizing firm will not engage in price discrimation.\nPrice discrimination occurs when a firm charges different prices for the same good or service. A firm may want to engage in price discrimination to increase its profit. For example, a restaurant may want to charge higher prices on its patio with a view than in its enclosed, air-conditioned dining room.\nHowever, in a perfect competitive market, a firm cannot engage in price discrimination. As a result, the profit-maximizing strategy for a firm in a perfect competitive industry is to set a single price for all buyers. This price will equal the marginal cost of producing one more unit of the good or service.\nThe graph below shows the profit-maximizing price and profit.

An economy is a country's total set of resources. An economy can be as small as a household or as large as a country.\nPeople make choices every day. Some choices are about how to spend their money. Other choices are about how to use their time. Making choices about how to spend money and how to use time is easy for most people. For example, you can choose to buy a hamburger or a salad for lunch. You can choose to watch a video or study for an exam during free time.\nBut what happens when you do not have enough money to buy what you want? Or what happens when you do not have enough time to do what you want? Then you must choose between competing interests.\nFor example, if you have to choose between buying a paperback copy of a book and a hardcover copy, you have a competing interest. You want to buy a book, but you also want to save money.\nSOLUTION: Economics is best described as the study of how people, companies, and countries make choices about how to use their resources. This is called the allocation of resources.\nHere are the steps in the allocation of resources:\n1. People and companies decide what they want to do or buy.\nThese wants and needs are called unlimited wants.\n2. People and companies compare their unlimited wants to their limited resources.\nLimited resources are the things that people and companies need to make the things they want and need.\n3.

When the government intervenes to correct a market failure, it usually does so by imposing taxes or fees to offset the external cost, or by subsidizing the good or service to offset the external benefit.\nA market failure may be caused by the production or consumption of a good or service.\nA. Production failures are caused by external costs that are not reflected in the price of the good or service. The external cost is a cost that is inflicted on parties who are not involved in the production or consumption of the good or service.\nFor example, the production of a good may produce an air pollution externality. The producers of the good do not pay for the pollution they generate, but the pollution does inflict a cost on parties who are not involved in the production of the good.\nB. Consumption failures are caused by external benefits that are not reflected in the price of the good or service. The external benefit is a benefit that is inflicted on parties who are not involved in the production or consumption of the good or service.\nFor example, the consumption of a good may provide a positive externality in the form of entertained by-standers. The consumers of the good do not pay for the entertainment they provide, but the entertainment does inflict a benefit on parties who are not involved in the consumption of the good.\nA market failure may be caused by both production and consumption.\nFor example, the overfishing of a lake may be a production failure and a consumption failure. The fishing producers over-harvest the lake, which inflicts a cost on the pollution party. The cost of the externality is not reflected in the price of the fish. As a result, the consumption of the fish may create a negative externality in the form of the lake being overfished. The consumers of the fish do not pay for the cost of the overfished lake, but the overfishing of the lake does inflict a cost on the pollution party.\nSOLUTION: The production and consumption of a good create a positive externality when the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The marginal social benefit is the marginal private benefit plus the marginal social benefit. The marginal social cost is the marginal private cost plus the marginal social cost.\nThe market quantity is the quantity that balances the marginal social cost and the marginal social benefit. At the market quantity, the marginal social benefit equals the marginal social cost.\nThe production and consumption of a good create a negative externality when the marginal social cost exceeds the marginal social benefit."}

The opportunity cost of workers' time is the wage that the firm must pay to buy labor. The wage is the price that workers receive for their labor.\nThe relationship between the opportunity cost of workers' time, the wage, and the demand for labor is shown in the following graph. As the wage increases, the demand for labor increases because it is cheaper to hire people than to use machines. As the wage decreases, the demand for labor decreases because it is more expensive to hire people than to use machines.\nThe marginal (physical) product of labor and the output price are related to the demand for labor, but they are not the factors that determine it. The marginal (physical) product of labor is the extra output that a worker produces when he or she works one more unit of time. The output price is the price that the firm receives for the goods or services that it sells.\nA competitive firm's profit is determined by the price that it receives for its goods or services and the cost of the goods or services that it sells. The wage is a cost. So, the profit is higher when the price is higher than the wage."}

{"question": "Which of the following might explain how a price decrease might cause a decrease in quantity demanded and an upward-sloping demand curve?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The good is inferior and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The good is normal and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The good is normal and the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The good is inferior and a luxury."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A demand curve is a downward-sloping line that shows the relationship between the quantity demanded and the price of a good or service. The curve shows how changes in price affect the quantity demanded.\nA change in the price of a good or service will usually affect both the quantity demanded and the consumer surplus. When the price goes down, the quantity demanded will usually go up, and the consumer surplus will usually get larger. When the price goes up, the quantity demanded will usually go down, and the consumer surplus will usually get smaller.\nHowever, the effect of a price change on the quantity demanded and consumer surplus is not always clear. For example, if a good is an inferior good\u2014a good for which demand falls when income falls\u2014a price decrease may not lead to an increase in quantity demanded. This is because the income effect of the price change may be stronger than the substitution effect.\nThe income effect of a price change is the effect of the change on consumption decisions that are determined by the consumer's income. The substitution effect is the effect of the change on consumption decisions that are determined by the relative prices of other goods.\nSOLUTION: To determine which choice is the correct answer, consider the effect of a price decrease on the quantity demanded and the consumer surplus.\nA decrease in price will usually lead to an increase in quantity demanded and a decrease in producer surplus. Producer surplus is the difference between the price at which a producer is selling a good and the price at which the producer is buying the goods used to make the good.\nA decrease in price will usually lead to a decrease in producer surplus.\nA good is inferior if its demand decreases when the consumer's income decreases. If a good is inferior, the income effect of a price change will usually be stronger than the substitution effect. This is because the decrease in demand for an inferior good is caused by the decrease in income. A decrease in price will not make the good more attractive relative to other goods.\nA good is normal if its demand stays the same when the consumer's income decreases. If a good is normal, the income effect and the substitution effect of a price change will each be zero.\nThe income effect of a price change is zero if the good is normal. The substitution effect of a price change is zero if the good is normal."}

The central bank, or monetary authority, has some control over the economy, but it does not plan the economy.\nIn a market economy, sellers are willing to sell a good or service at a certain price. Buyers are willing to buy a good or service at a certain price. If the two prices are the same, a sale takes place.\nIf one price is higher than the other, an imbalance is created. To remove the imbalance, the price that is too high will tend to drop. The price that is too low will tend to rise.\nIn this way, the market clearing price is established. At this price, the quantity that is for sale will equal the quantity that is for sale.\nThe market-clearing price is also the point where the supply and demand curves meet. The supply curve shows how the price of a good or service affects the quantity that is for sale. The demand curve shows how the price of a good or service affects the quantity that is for sale.\nIn a market economy, economic resources are allocated through the interaction of buyers and sellers. The central bank does not decide which goods or services to produce. It does not decide how much of those goods or services to produce.\nThe central bank does have some control over the economy.

A monopoly is a market with only one seller. If a monopoly firm raises its price, it will still sell some of its output. So, the demand for the monopoly firm's output is inelastic.\nThe demand for the oligopoly firm's output with a homogenous product is likely to be elastic. Oligopoly is a market with a few sellers. If the price of a homogenous product changes, consumers can buy another firm's product instead. So, the demand for a oligopoly firm's output with a homogenous product is elastic.\nThe demand for the oligopoly firm's output with a differentiated product is likely to be inelastic. Oligopoly is a market with a few sellers. If a oligopoly firm changes the price of its product, consumers still have no other sellers to buy from. So, the demand for a oligopoly firm's output with a differentiated product is inelastic.\nThe demand for the perfectly competitive firm's output is likely to be elastic. In a perfectly competitive market, there are many sellers. If a seller raises its price, consumers can buy from another seller. So, the demand for a perfectly competitive firm's output is elastic."}

The market is a great way to get what you want because it matches up buyers and sellers who want to trade with each other.\nWhen buyers and sellers meet in the market, they will trade until they are both better off. The price that a buyer is willing to pay for a good or service is called the buyer's demand. The price that a seller is willing to charge for a good or service is called the seller's supply.\nThe market supply curve is a graph that shows the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity that sellers are willing to supply. The market supply curve slopes upward, which means that an increase in the price of a good or service will cause the quantity that sellers are willing to supply to increase. This happens because sellers are willing to supply more of a good or service at a higher price.\nThe market demand curve is a graph that shows the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity that buyers are willing to buy. The market demand curve slopes downward, which means that an increase in the price of a good or service will cause the quantity that buyers are willing to buy to decrease. This happens because buyers are willing to buy less of a good or service at a higher price.\nSOLUTION: To find the market supply curve for a particular good, one would need to aggregate the firm supply curves horizontally.

The curve is the supply curve. It shows how the price of a good or service affects the quantity that firms make and sell.\nThe supply curve is upward-sloping. This means that if the price of a good or service increases, the quantity that firms sell also increases. This happens because at a higher price, firms can earn higher profits. So, firms make and sell more of the good or service.\nThe supply curve is also elastic. This means that the curve is flexible. If the price of a good or service changes, the quantity that firms sell changes in the opposite direction. For example, if the price of a good or service goes down, the quantity that firms sell goes up. This happens because at a lower price, consumers can afford to buy more of the good or service. So, firms sell more of the good or service.\nSOLUTION: The ability for firms to enter and exit a market over time means that the long run supply curve is more elastic. If many firms can enter a market, the supply of the good or service will increase. This will cause the price to decrease. If many firms can exit a market, the supply of the good or service will decrease. This will cause the price to increase."}

When the quantity of a good or service increases, the supply curve will shift to the right. When the quantity of a good or service decreases, the supply curve will shift to the left.\nThe market price will change to keep the quantity of a good or service traded equal to the quantity that is available. If the price of a good or service changes, the quantity of the good or service that is requested will change. This will cause the demand curve to change. If the price goes up, the demand curve will shift to the left. If the price goes down, the demand curve will shift to the right.\nThe market price and the quantity of a good or service traded will often change until they are back in equilibrium, or in balance.

This is a problem for the provider of the good or service, as it has to bear the full cost of providing the good or service and receives no payment from the free riders.\nA free rider problem can occur when the number of free riders is too large. If too many people use a public good or service without paying for it, the provider of the good or service will not be able to pay for it either.\nThere are several ways a government can try to avoid a free rider problem:\n1. Subsidies: The government can pay for a portion of the cost of the good or service. This makes it more affordable for those who use it, and so reduces the number of free riders.\n2. Benefit taxes: The government can tax people who benefit from a good or service in order to pay for it. This makes the users of the good or service pay for it, rather than the government.\n3. Education and awareness: The government can try to educate people about the value of a good or service. This can help persuade people to pay for it.\n4.

{"question": "Which of the following statements about a price ceiling is accurate?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "An effective price ceiling must be at a price below the equilibrium price."}, {"label": "B", "text": "A price ceiling will increase the quantity of the good supplied."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A price ceiling will cause a shift in the demand curve for the good."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A price ceiling will have no effect on the quantity of the good supplied."}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A price ceiling is a legal limit on the price a seller can charge for a good or service. If the price of a good or service is below the price ceiling, the ceiling will have no effect on the quantity of the good or service supplied. This is because the market price is below the price that sellers are willing to accept.\nIf the price of a good or service is above the price ceiling, the ceiling will cause a shift in the demand curve for the good or service. The demand curve shows how much of a good or service people are willing to buy at different prices. The price ceiling causes the demand curve to shift to a lower price.\nSo, a price ceiling will increase the quantity of the good or service supplied only if the price of the good or service is above the price ceiling.\nSOLUTION: A price ceiling will increase the quantity of the good supplied.\nIf the price of a good is below the price ceiling, the ceiling will have no effect on the quantity of the good supplied.\nIf the price of a good is above the price ceiling, the ceiling will cause a shift in the demand curve for the good. The demand curve shows how much of a good people are willing to buy at different prices. The price ceiling causes the demand curve to shift to a lower price.\nThe shift in the demand curve increases the quantity of the good that is supplied."}
