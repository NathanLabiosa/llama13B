A selection procedure has adverse impact if it causes a significant disproportionate number of members of one sex to be selected out of the group. For example, if a selection test significantly disproportionately selects out 60% of one sex, then the selection procedure has adverse impact.\nAn employer has a disparate impact, or adverse impact, if the employer's selection procedures have a significant disproportionate effect on one sex. For example, if 60% of the individuals rejected by a selection procedure are of one sex, then the employer has a disparate impact.\nAn employer has disparate treatment if the employer treats one sex less favorably than the other sex with respect to selection. For example, if male applicants are given a selection test that female applicants are not, then the employer has disparate treatment.\nSOLUTION: The information in the passage illustrates a situation with adverse impact. Female applicants have lower scores on a selection test, but they perform as well on the job as do male applicants. This means that the selection procedure has a significant disproportionate effect on the opposite sex."}

{"question": "On the basis of his investigation of the relationship between affiliation and anxiety, Schachter concluded that which of the following best accounted for the desire of high-anxiety research participants to wait with other high-anxiety participants?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "demand characteristics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "evaluation apprehension"}, {"label": "C", "text": "relief from discomfort"}, {"label": "D", "text": "social comparison"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: People have a basic need to belong, to be part of a group. This need leads people to form affiliations with others who share their interests, values, or lifestyle. In forming these affiliations, people seek to create a sense of belonging.\nBut forming affiliations is not always easy. When people are with others who are part of their chosen group, they experience both evaluation apprehension and relief from discomfort. Evaluation apprehension is the anxiety people feel when they think others are evaluating them. Relief from discomfort is the positive feeling people experience when they are with others who share their interests, values, or lifestyle.\nBoth evaluation apprehension and relief from discomfort contribute to the desire to affiliate with others. But the desire to affiliate with others who are part of one's own group, or in-group, is even more powerful. When people are with their in-group, they experience social comparison. They evaluate themselves in relation to others in their group.\nOn the other hand, the desire to affiliate with others who are part of other groups, or out-groups, is often based on the need to reduce anxiety. This is particularly true when people are away from their own group. When people are with out-group members, they may experience either increased anxiety or reduced anxiety. Increased anxiety occurs when people are with out-group members who are unlike themselves. But reduced anxiety occurs when people are with out-group members who are similar to themselves.\nSOLUTION: The desire of high-anxiety research participants to wait with other high-anxiety participants is best explained by social comparison. Participants wanted to compare themselves with others who had similar levels of anxiety."}

For workers, goals provide direction for their work. If a worker\u2019s goals are well-defined and challenging, the worker is likely to feel more engaged and committed to the organization. For the organization, effective goal-setting helps ensure that workers are working toward important organizational outcomes.\nOrganizations can set goals in different ways. Some organizations involve their workers in the goal-setting process, allowing workers to have a say in what the goals will be. Other organizations set goals unilaterally, with top-level managers deciding on the goals without input from workers.\nWhether workers are involved in goal setting affects the difficulty of the goals. When workers help set the goals, the goals are likely to be more challenging and better-defined. This is because workers who help set the goals are invested in their success. As a result, they are more likely to put in the effort to achieve them."}

It is a process that occurs whenever an organism learns to associate an object or event with another object or event. This association can help the organism predict what will happen next. For example, if you have a dog, you may have noticed that the dog begins to drool when it sees you with a leash in your hand. This is because the dog has learned to associate the leash with going for a walk.\nClassical conditioning can also be used to explain phobic reactions to benign objects or events. A phobic reaction is an exaggerated or irrational fear of an object or event. Some phobic reactions may be caused by a traumatic event. For example, a person who has been in a serious car accident may develop a phobic reaction to driving. However, many phobic reactions are due to classical conditioning. For example, a person may become afraid of a benign object that is associated with a traumatic event.\nSOLUTION: Phobic reactions to benign objects or events are acquired when those objects or events become associated with a stimulus that naturally produces a fear response. This is called classical conditioning.\nFor example, imagine that a person has a fear of dogs. This fear is a naturally occurring response. Later, you may become afraid of a rabbit. This is because the rabbit becomes associated with the fear of dogs. The rabbit becomes a conditioned stimulus because it is associated with a unconditioned stimulus (the fear of dogs)."}

For example, cognitive ability is a construct. Cognitive ability includes items such as the ability to solve problems, learn quickly, and understand complex ideas.\nA mediator is a variable that helps to explain why two other variables are related. For example, if being depressed makes it difficult for a person to concentrate, then being depressed is a mediator in the relationship between concentration and mood.\nA moderator is a variable that can change the relationship between two other variables. For example, if a student is extremely motivated to do well on a test, then the relationship between the student's preparation and test performance may be stronger than it is for a student with lower motivation. In this case, motivation is an moderator in the relationship between preparation and test performance.\nA covariate is a variable that is different from and unrelated to the other variables in a study. It is sometimes included in a study to make the analysis easier to interpret.\nConstruct validity threat occurs when there is a problem with the constructs in a study. For example, if one construct is defined in terms of another construct, the study's construct validity is threatened.\nSOLUTION: The motivational interviewing intervention is a variable that affects client motivation. This means that client motivation is a construct.\nThe motivational interviewing intervention is intended to decrease problem alcohol use. So, client motivation is a mediator in the relationship between the intervention and problem alcohol use."}

Others may need help with everyday tasks.\nSOLUTION: Mental retardation associated with phenylketonuria (PKU) is preventable with a special diet.\nPKU is a genetic disorder. It is caused by a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme helps break down phenylalanine, an amino acid found in many foods. If phenylalanine is not broken down, it can build up in the blood and cause damage to the brain.\nA special diet can help prevent the build-up of phenylalanine. This diet restricts the amount of phenylalanine a person eats. A person with PKU will have to follow this diet for life."}

A behavior is a sequence of actions that is repeating and purposeful. Behavior includes both what an individual does and how that individual thinks.\nA behavior is learned. Behaviors are learned in several ways. An individual may learn a behavior by observing others. An individual may learn a behavior by being told about the behavior. An individual may learn a behavior by having the behavior done to the individual.\nSome behaviors, such as riding a bicycle, are acquired by learning. Other behaviors, such as driving a car, are acquired by being taught.\nA behavior is a response to a situation. An individual's behaviors, including symptoms, are a response to the people and world around them.\nSome behaviors, such as taking medicine when you have a headache, are responses to a specific situation. Other behaviors, such as riding a bicycle to work, are responses to a general situation.\nA behavior that is maintained is a behavior that is useful in some way. A behavior that is maintained is a behavior that has a function. A function is what a behavior does.\nSome functions are aware. For example, talking is a behavior that has an aware function. Talking informs others about your thoughts and feelings.\nOther functions are unaware. For example, avoiding eye contact is a behavior that has an unaware function. Avoiding eye contact keeps others from feeling threatened by your gaze.\nA behavior that is maintained is a behavior that has helpfully coped with a problem in the past. A behavior that is maintained is a behavior that has worked to make the past more manageable.\nSome behaviors, such as pulling your hair out when you are under a lot of stress, are not helpful. These behaviors are called depressogenic behaviors. Depressogenic behaviors make depression worse.\nA behavior that is maintained is a behavior that has been reinforced in the past. Behaviors that are reinforced are more likely to be repeated in the future.\nA behavior is reinforced by its consequences. Consequences are what happens after a behavior.\nConsequences can be what is wanted. For example, feeling better can be a consequence of taking medicine.\nConsequences can also be what is unwanted. For example, feeling tired can be a consequence of not getting enough sleep.\nA behavior is also reinforced by unintended consequences. Unintended consequences are what happens after a behavior that is not wanted.\nUnintended consequences can make a behavior more likely to be repeated. For example, continuing to smoke after a heart attack is a consequence of smoking.\nSOLUTION: According to Lewinsohn's behavioral model, a lack of reinforcement from the environment and chronic physical and psychological stress can cause depression. These are an environment that is not reinforcing and a stressor that is present in the environment."}

The bilateral stimulation can be in the form of eye movements, audio tones, or tactile pulses.\nThe positive thoughts are installed to counterbalance the negative thoughts often brought on by past traumas. Installing positive thoughts can help change the way a person thinks about herself and the world around her.\nProcessing traumatic memories involves having the person describe the traumatic event while receiving bilateral stimulation. This process is called desensitization because the bilateral stimulation helps the person become less sensitive to the traumatic memories. As the person becomes less sensitive to the memories, the person is able to remember and discuss the traumatic event without excessive emotional distress.\nUtilizing bilateral stimulation during EMDR is believed to increase the person's ability to process the traumatic memories. Bilateral stimulation is thought to cause the two hemispheres of the brain to communicate with each other. This communication may help resolve the emotional distress caused by the traumatic memories.\nSOLUTION: EMDR is a form of imaginal exposure. Imaginal exposure is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy in which a person uses his or her imagination to create a new, less distressing interpretation of a traumatic event."}

As children, we form attachments to our caregivers. These attachments can affect how we behave and feel in all of our relationships.\nAttachment patterns are typically classified as secure, anxious, or avoidant.\nA securely attached child feels safe to explore the world around them because they know their caregiver will be there for them when they return. This type of attachment is often described as a healthy attachment.\nAn anxiously attached child becomes very upset when their caregiver leaves. They may also have difficulty sleeping and be very clingy. This type of attachment is often described as an insecure-resistant attachment.\nAn avoidantly attached child may not seem to care when their caregiver leaves. They may appear to be independent and self-sufficient. But when their caregiver returns, the child may act indifferent, such as by turning away or looking away. This type of attachment is often described as an insecure-avoidant attachment.\nSOLUTION: This child is very distressed when separated from his/her mother and continues to be highly anxious when she returns.

The therapist begins by exposing the patient to less fearful parts of the feared situation and gradually exposing the patient to more fearful parts. The therapist uses exposure in vivo and exposure in fantasy to help the patient overcome the phobia.\nExposure in vivo is the most effective behavioral treatment for agoraphobia. The therapist exposes the patient to the feared situation in real life. The therapist begins by exposing the patient to less fearful parts of the feared situation and gradually exposing the patient to more fearful parts. The therapist uses relaxation techniques to help the patient cope with the anxiety.\nExposure in fantasy is a type of imagery in which the patient mentally exposes himself to the feared situation. The therapist teaches the patient relaxation techniques to use while imagining the feared situation.\nShaping is a technique in which the therapist starts with easier tasks and gradually increases the difficulty. The therapist uses shaping to help the patient learn to cope with the feared situation. For example, the therapist may begin by having the patient imagine being in a crowd and then gradually expose the patient to real-life crowds.\nDeep muscle relaxation is a technique in which the patient uses special breathing and relaxing techniques to reduce anxiety.

As they do, they gain an understanding of the world and their place in it. This understanding is called object permanence.\nBefore they can understand object permanence, children believe that objects are permanently within their field of view. If an object is not within their field of view, the child assumes it is no longer there.\nFor example, a 5-month-old is sitting in a bouncy seat in a backyard. The seat is near a tree. The infant can see the tree. But when the infant looks away from the tree, and then looks back, the tree is gone! The infant thinks that the tree has gone away.\nChildren usually learn object permanence between 6 and 10 months of age.\nSOLUTION: A 4-month-old has not yet developed object permanence. The child believes that objects are permanently within their field of view.\nSo, when a rattle is hidden from the 4-month-old, the child assumes the rattle is no longer there. The child looks at their mother to see if the mother has the rattle."}

This is called the \"normalcy innateness assumption.\" Because of this assumption, people find it difficult to imagine that other people's experiences, knowledge, and opinions could be different from their own.\nIn research, the normalcy innateness assumption can lead to biases in studying the social sciences. One of the ways it can do this is by making it difficult to accurately measure the prevalence, or how common, a behavior is.\nImagine that you are studying the behavior of eating fruits and vegetables. You could ask questions to find out how many people eat fruits and vegetables. But how many people is this? Is it most people? Only some people?\nA survey found that 75% of people eat fruits and vegetables. This is a prevalence of 75%.\nThe normalcy innateness assumption can make it difficult to determine the prevalence of a behavior. Most people believe that eating fruits and vegetables is a good idea. So, it is not surprising that most people eat fruits and vegetables. But it is difficult to determine how common this behavior is.\nSOLUTION: This question asks about the accuracy of mothers' memories regarding their children's interpersonal relations. Interpersonal relations include social interactions with others.\nThe passage tells you that when mothers describe their children's social interactions, their memories are most accurate. This is called eyewitness memory. Eyewitness memory is the most accurate when the witness is a long way from the scene of the incident."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as if they are the same or different.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible types. Each type is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter.\nThe Flower color gene has two possible types: F and f.\nThe F type is dominant over the f type. This means that the F type version of the gene will produce a flower color that appears as if it is the only version of the gene.\nAn organism with at least one dominant gene type for a gene will have the dominant type version of the gene. An organism with only recessive gene types for a gene will have the recessive type version of the gene.\nAn organism with two gene types of the same type for a gene will have that type of the gene.

Time-out is used to decrease undesirable behavior.\nThe purpose of time-out is to give an individual time to calm down and reflect on their behavior. The individual is usually told to sit quietly and not to engage in any activities. The length of time out varies, but it is usually relatively short, such as 5 to 10 minutes for each year of the individual's age.\nTime-out is a form of negative reinforcement. A negative reinforcer is a stimulus that is presented to an individual after the individual engages in a desired behavior. The presentation of the negative reinforcer makes the undesired behavior less likely to occur in the future. The individual may find being removed from a positive stimulus to be a negative experience, so the individual is more likely to engage in the desired behavior in the future to avoid the negative reinforcer.\nSOLUTION: Time-out procedures in manipulating behaviors are based on the conditioning concept of negative reinforcement. When an individual engages in a desired behavior, a negative stimulus is presented to the individual. The individual is then removed from a positive stimulus. The individual is more likely to engage in the desired behavior in the future to avoid the negative reinforcer."}

As described by Heider (1958), people have an innate tendency to search for and interpret patterns in behavior. This tendency leads people to assign causes to behavior, which can be either internal or external.\nInternal causes are those that are under the control of the person.\nExternal causes are those that are not under the control of the person.\nSome explanations are more stable and permanent than others. This distinction is between stability and instability.\nStable causes are those that are expected to continue in the future.\nUnstable causes are those that are not expected to continue in the future.\nSome explanations are more global than others. This distinction is between global and specific causes.\nGlobal causes are those that can be applied to many situations.\nSpecific causes are those that are specific to one situation.\nSome explanations are more equitable than others. This distinction is between equitable and inequitable causes.\nEquitable causes are those that are fair and just.\nInequitable causes are those that are unjust and unfair.\nHeider proposed that people have an innate tendency to search for stability, globality, and equity when interpreting the causes of behavior.\nWeiner (1985, 1992) later proposed an extension to Heider's work. He proposed that people also have an innate tendency to seek out information that is relevant to their judgments of internality, stability, and equity. In other words, when people make attributions to others, they are more likely to consider internal, stable, and equitable causes when the behavior is bad, and external, unstable, and inequitable causes when the behavior is good.

You begin by defining a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis says that there is no change in the condition you are observing. The alternative hypothesis says that there is a change in the condition you are observing.\nFor example, the null hypothesis for a medical test says there is no disease present. The alternative hypothesis says that the disease is present.\nTo test these hypotheses, you collect data. You can use the data to make a decision about whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis.\nThe decision to reject or accept the null hypothesis is based on the level of significance you choose. The level of significance is the probability of making a Type I error. A Type I error is rejecting a false null hypothesis.\nThere are two levels of significance: \u03b1 and \u03b2. The level of significance \u03b1 is chosen by the researcher. \u03b1 represents the probability of making a Type I error.\nIf the level of significance is \u03b1 = 0.01, the probability of making a Type I error is 0.01, or 1%. This means that the researcher belies that there is a difference, when in fact there is no difference.\nIf the level of significance is \u03b1 = 0.05, the probability of making a Type I error is 0.05, or 5%. This means that the researcher believes that there is a difference, when in fact there is no difference.\nThe level of significance \u03b2 represents the probability of making a Type II error. A Type II error is rejecting a true null hypothesis.\nIf the level of significance is \u03b2 = 0.01, the probability of making a Type II error is 0.01, or 1%. This means that the researcher believes that there is no difference, when in fact there is a difference.\nIf the level of significance is \u03b2 = 0.05, the probability of making a Type II error is 0.05, or 5%. This means that the researcher believes that there is no difference, when in fact there is a difference.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is B.

One of the key tools used in employment testing is the aptitude test. An aptitude test is a standardized test that measures an individual's ability in a particular area.\nAptitude tests can be timed or untimed. Untimed aptitude tests allow the individual to work at his or her own pace, finishing when he or she has completed the test. Untimed aptitude tests are often used in the employment of public safety personnel, such as police officers and firefighters.\nNorm-referenced tests compare an individual's score to those of others who have taken the same test.\nNorm-referenced aptitude tests describe an individual's score as compared to others who have taken the test before. For example, an individual's score may be in the top 50% or in the top 10%.\nNorm-referenced tests are often used in employment testing because they can be used to compare the test performance of large numbers of individuals.\nA multiple aptitude battery is a test that contains multiple aptitude tests. A job candidate may take a multiple aptitude battery as part of an employment test.\nA work-sample test is a test that requires a job candidate to perform tasks that are similar to what he or she would do on the job. A job candidate who is applying to be a welder, for example, may be asked to perform a work-sample test that involves welding."}

It applies to all organisms, including people. One part of evolution is sexual selection, which is which organisms choose mates with certain traits. The choice of traits can include a combination of traits that are heritable, or passed down through families.\nAnother part of evolution is parental investment, which is the time and resources that parents invest in their offspring. The amount of parental investment can affect the types of traits that are favored by natural selection. For example, offspring with traits that need a lot of parental investment will tend to have fewer offspring than offspring with traats that do not need as much parental investment. This difference in offspring production can change the types of traits that are found in the species over time.\nSOLUTION: The two theories that provide the conceptual framework for the evolution of mating adaptations are sexual selection and parental investment.\nSexual selection is the part of evolution that deals with how organisms choose mates. It can operate on many different traits, including traits that are used in mate choice. The following graph shows how sexual selection can lead to the evolution of a specific trait:\nParental investment is the time and resources that parents invest in their offspring. Because offspring with certain traits may need more parental investment, these offspring are likely to have fewer offspring than offspring with other traits.

The strategies are usually to change the environment or the way that the environment is used.\nA functional behavioral assessment is an assessment that uses observational and other methods to identify the purpose or function of a behavior. The function of a behavior is what it does for the person who is doing it. For example, a behavior of kicking a table may be functioning to release anger.\nA norm-referenced test is an assessment that compares an individual's performance to that of other people. For example, a test that compares a person's math skills to those of other students is a norm-referenced test.\nA work sample is an assessment that involves having a person complete a task or assignment that is typical of what he or she would do in a particular setting.

When you make ethical decisions, you try to do the right thing. Ethical behavior is based on standards of right and wrong that guide individual and group behavior.\nEthical considerations involve questions of what is good, fair, and right. An ethical decision is one that attempts to balance the needs and wants of all involved parties. Ethical considerations are not always clear-cut, and different people may have different beliefs about what is ethical.\nMany professions have ethical codes that provide guidance for professionals working in that field. These codes usually cover issues such as confidentiality, client or patient welfare, and conflicts of interest.\nA conflict of interest occurs when your personal interests compete with your duty to your clients or patients. For example, a doctor has a conflict of interest when he is considering whether to prescribe a medication that he owns a significant number of shares in.\nIn addition to following ethical codes, professionals should also be aware of the laws and regulations that govern their work. These laws and regulations can be found in sources such as the Affordable Care Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nSOLUTION: First, waiving the co-payment for low-income clients is ethical as long as the insurance company does not explicitly prohibit such arrangements. This is because the insurance company may have a contract with the client that specifies the obligations of the client and the insurance company. The client and the insurance company are parties to the contract, and they are affected by any changes to the contract.\nSecond, billing the insurance company for an increased hourly fee in order to collect your full fee is not ethical. This is a conflict of interest. You should not be trying to get more money from the insurance company by claiming that you need to charge the client more for your services.\nThird, it is ethical only if the insurance company is aware of the arrangement. The insurance company may have a contract with the client that specifies the obligations of the client and the insurance company. The client and the insurance company are parties to the contract, and they are affected by any changes to the contract.\nFourth, waiving the co-payment for low-income clients is a common and ethical practice.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Down Syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality. A person with Down Syndrome has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two."}

Three components of an intention are the following:\n1. Attitude toward the behavior: A person's overall evaluation of the behavior, including both the person's affective (feeling) and cognitive (thought) responses. An attitude is created by a person's sum of feelings and thoughts about the behavior.\n2. Subjective norms: The person's perception of the expectations of his or her significant others (e.g., family, friends, and social groups) about the behavior. A person's subjective norms are affected by the person's own values and the values of the people around him or her.\n3. Perceived behavioral control: The person's assessment of the behavior's ease or difficulty. A person's perceived behavioral control depends on the person's past experiences and resources, as well as the context in which the behavior occurs.\nSOLUTION: To decide if a behavior will occur, a person will weigh the benefits of the behavior against the costs of the behavior. The benefits and costs are created by the person's attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.\nIf the benefits of a behavior outweigh the costs, the person's intention to perform the behavior will be strong. If the costs outweigh the benefits, the person's intention to perform the behavior will be weak."}

The longer the client has had the problem, the harder it is to solve.\nLack of a strong reinforcement of symptoms.\nClients whose problems are reinforced by their environment are less likely to have a favorable prognosis. For example, a client with an alcohol problem will not have a favorable prognosis if the client's job reinforces the need to drink.\nMotivation to change.\nClients who are motivated to change are more likely to have a favorable prognosis. A client's motivation to change will often improve as the client gains insight into the problem.\nSocial support.\nClients who have a supportive social system are more likely to have a favorable prognosis.

One of the best ways to induce LTP is to expose the synapses to high levels of activity. LTP has many features of memory, including the requirement for a strong synapse and the need for the synapse to be active during the initial learning event.\nSOLUTION: Learning and memory are critical functions of the brain. LTP is believed to be a major cellular mechanism that supports learning and memory. LTP can change the strength of a synapse for several hours, which means that it has the ability to store information. The strength of a synapse determines how well the neurons will communicate. If the synapse is strengthened, the neurons will communicate more effectively. This increased communication is important for learning and memory.\nHunger and thirst are immediate physical needs.

This tendency can lead people to evaluate themselves in ways that avoid the discomfort of inadequacy. People can verify their good evaluations or disconfirm their bad evaluations.\nSelf-verification theory explains the ways that people verify or disconfirm their self-evaluations. This theory identifies four basic methods that people use to do this:\nSocial comparison: You compare yourself to others to see if you're as good as you think you are. If you are better than others, you verify your good self-evaluations. If you are worse, you disconfirm them.\nAdaptive social comparison: You compare yourself to others who are similar to you in abilities, personality, or social status. This type of comparison helps you evaluate your own abilities. If you compare yourself to people who are better off, you will disconfirm your good self-evaluations. If you compare yourself to people who are worse off, you will confirm your good self-evaluations.\nPrivate self-consistency: You compare your self-evaluations in one domain to your self-evaluations in other domains. If your self-evaluations are consistent across domains, you will consider them to be valid. If your self-evaluations are inconsistent, you will consider them to be invalid.\nPublic self-consistency: Others compare your self-evaluations to your behavior in different areas. If your self-evaluations are consistent with your behavior, they will consider your self-evaluations to be valid. If your self-evaluations are inconsistent with your behavior, they will consider your self-evaluations to be invalid."}

The privilege is a confidentiality rule that protects communications between a client and her attorney. The privilege serves to promote the honest and complete dialogue that is essential for the attorney to provide competent legal advice.\nThe privilege applies to communications that are confidential and made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. It does not apply to communications that are not confidential or that are made for a purpose other than obtaining legal advice.\nThere are two types of attorney-client privilege:\n1. Attorney-client privilege: The privilege applies to communications with an attorney. This privilege is designed to protect the client's confidential statements to the attorney.\nThe privilege does not apply to communications with employees of the attorney.\n2. Client-to-client privilege: The privilege applies to communications between the client and a different client. This privilege is designed to protect the confidential statements made by the two clients to each other.\nThe client-to-client privilege does not apply to communications with the attorney.\nWhen the client is a corporation or other organization, the entity's employees or agents may assert the privilege.\nThe privilege may be waived. A waiver occurs when a party makes a statement or takes a action that discloses a privileged communication. A waiver is intentional and can be found to have happened when the disclosure was made with an intent to waive the privilege.\nA waiver of the attorney-client privilege by the client waives the privilege for all communications between the client and the attorney. A waiver of the client-to-client privilege by one client waives the privilege for all communications between the two clients.\nSOLUTION: The opposing party's attorney is asking for confidential client information. To provide the information, you would need to balance the rules of confidentiality against the rules of disclosure.\nThe rules of confidentiality say that you should not disclose confidential information. The rules of disclosure say that you should disclose confidential information when required to do so by a court order.\nIf the client has signed a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, the privilege is waived for that client. The client's attorney can then provide the information.\nIf the client has not signed a waiver, the client's attorney should not provide the information without a court order. The client's attorney can assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver."}

Principles take priority over laws, so a law may not guarantee that an action is ethical. For example, in the United States, it is legal to burn an American flag, but such an action is still considered ethical.\nPsychologists are held to a high standard of ethical behavior. One of the principles that psychologists follow is the American Psychological Association's (APA) Code of Ethics. This code tells psychologists what they should do to be ethical in their work.\nThe main points of the APA Code of Ethics are:\nOpposition to unjust practices: Psychologists do not engage in or condone practices that are unfair or discriminatory.\nBeneficence: Psychologists try to do good and avoid harm.\nNonmaleficence: Psychologists try to avoid harm.\nConfidentiality: Psychologists respect the privacy of their clients and do not disclose information without consent.\nRespect for people's rights: Psychologists do not violate the rights of clients, research subjects, or other people.\nMany mental health professionals also follow the APA's Guidelines for the Practice of Psychotherapy. These guidelines include information about the types of treatments that are considered effective, as well as information about how to help patients.\nSOLUTION: The ad is not ethical because it makes misleading claims of effectiveness. The ad promises a guaranteed cure for anxiety. But there is no guaranteed cure for anxiety. Every person is different, and what works for one person may not work for another."}

To do this, you must stop the reinforcement.\nExtinction is a treatment-of-choice when a behavior is no longer wanted. Behaviors that are no longer needed, such as a child sucking his thumb, may be extinguished.\nHowever, there are several reasons why operant extinction may not be the best choice as a treatment-of-choice:\nAn alternative behavior cannot be identified. If there is no other behavior to replace the problem behavior, operant extinction is not a treatment-of-choice.\nThe behavior has been reinforced on a continuous schedule. If a behavior is reinforced continuously, it is likely to continue.\nA temporary increase in the behavior cannot be tolerated. If the behavior must increase temporarily, operant extinction is not a treatment-of-choice. For example, if a child is jumping up and down to get attention, you cannot extinct this behavior. The child must have a different way to get attention.\nThe baseline levels of the behavior cannot be established. If the behavior is not occurring frequently enough to establish a baseline, operant extinction is not a treatment-of-choice."}

The infant does this by using the senses to explore the environment and test the impact of the environment on the body. The ability to use the senses to perceive the environment is called accommodation. The ability to use the body to act on the environment is called locomotion. The ability to use the mind to make things happen is called problem-solving.\nDuring the second stage, called separation-individuation, the infant begins to become an independent person. The infant does this by identifying what he or she wants and needs, and then acting on that desire. The ability to express feelings and needs is called modulation. The ability to think about and plan for the future is called foreclosure. The ability to create a sense of self is called differentiation."}

Some of these insights come from the study of animal behavior, and others come from observing human infants.\nIn the 1950s, the Austrian zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that birds have an innate period during which they can learn to associate a specific object with food. This period is called a sensitive period. Lorenz observed that if he kept a bird during its critical period, the bird would recognize and approach any object that it associated with food.\nHuman infants also have a sensitive period for social referencing. During this period, if an infant looks to one of their parents when they are upset, the parent will usually respond by comforting the infant. By doing this, the parent helps the infant learn to cope with upsetting situations.\nSome animals have a critical period for attachment. This is a period during which an infant animal must form attachments to its parents. If an animal is separated from its parents during this period, it may develop social and emotional problems.\nHuman infants may have a critical period for attachment as well. If an infant does not form a strong bond with their primary caregiver, they may develop social and emotional problems.\nOther animals have a sensitive period for vocal imitation. During this period, an infant animal will imitate the sounds it hears. In humans, this sensitive period for vocal imitation precedes the development of language.\nHumans also have a sensitive period for language acquisition. At the appropriate age, children can easily learn the language or languages they hear around them."}

In order to do this, adolescents must develop a new attitude toward their relationships. They must learn to see themselves as separate from their parents and other adults, while at the same time, they must learn to connect with others in new ways.\nDuring early adolescence, actors focus on establishing their identities and gaining independence. They may resist their parents' efforts to control them and may struggle to find their own way.\nDuring middle adolescence, actors seek closure and aim for a sense of achievement and completion. They may focus on their schoolwork, sports, or other activities and begin to build a foundation for their future.\nDuring late adolescence, actors seek intimacy and form close, supportive relationships with others. They may begin to consider their place in the world and their future roles as adults.\nSOLUTION: Adler's individual psychology is most consistent with the belief that a child's misbehavior has one of four goals \u2014 i.e., attention, revenge, power, or to display inadequacy \u2014 because Adler believed that children act to satisfy their own needs. According to Adler, children are motivated by a need for attention, a need to compensate for feelings of inferiority, a need for power, or a need to seek revenge.\nBeck\u2019s cognitive-behavioral therapy, Perls\u2019s Gestalt therapy, and Mahler\u2019s object relations theory are all types of psychotherapy that focus on the child's relationships with others.

This can happen because of differences in when their parents were born.\nChildren's development can be affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors are passed down through families. Environmental factors are caused by the places where children live.\nFive-digit codes in the chart below show when children are most likely to do certain things. These codes use a mix of letters and numbers. The letters tell you about the factors that affect development.

The numbers that are higher are later in time.\nNotice that the numbers are higher for the more recent cohorts. This shows that children who are part of more recent cohorts are likely to sit up, walk, and talk later in life.\nThis difference in timing is called a secular trend.

According to Jung, the unconscious is not a chaotic mass of thoughts and images, but rather a complex and ordered system that can inform the conscious mind. Archetypes, which are inherited from our ancestors, are the building blocks of the unconscious.\nJung proposed that the psyche, or human mind, can be divided into three parts: the conscious, the unconscious, and the personal unconscious. The conscious and personal unconscious are the parts of the mind that are populated with thoughts and images that a person is aware of. The unconscious is the part of the mind that is not accessible to the conscious mind.\nJung also proposed that the psyche can be divided into two main parts: the ego and the self. The ego is the part of the psyche that is responsible for a person's actions and thoughts. The self is the part of the psyche that contains the archetypes and is responsible for a person's sense of self and purpose in life.\nJungian analysis is a type of psychotherapy that aims to bring unconscious thoughts and feelings into the conscious mind, where they can be understood and integrated into a person's life. This process, called individuation, is the central goal of Jungian analysis.\nSOLUTION: According to Jung, the four tenets of analytical psychotherapy are:\nthe unconscious, the ego, and the self.\nThese tenets are the building blocks of the psyche, and they interact to form a person's sense of self. By exploring these tenets in analysis, a person can gain a deeper understanding of their unconscious thoughts and feelings and how they relate to their sense of self."}

For example, you might come to associate a certain street with the accident you previously had.\nHigher-order conditioning is a type of learning in which a neutral stimulus is associated with a response that is associated with a meaningful stimulus. For example, you might come to associate a certain color with the anxiety you feel when thinking about an accident.\nLatent learning is a type of learning that occurs without explicit instruction or reinforcement. For example, you may learn the social rules of a game, such as the rules of baseball, simply by observing games.\nResponse shaping is a type of learning in which a neutral stimulus is paired with a response that is initially part of the organism. For example, a mother bird may eat part of an egg to encourage her baby bird to eat.\nSOLUTION: This anxiety is an instance of mediated generalization. You became anxious after reading about an automobile accident some months after having had such an accident. This shows that the neutral stimulus (reading about an automobile accident) is associated with the meaningful event (having had an accident)."}

It is caused by a loss of dopamine-producing cells in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Dopamine is a chemical that helps to coordinate body movements.\nWhen dopamine-producing cells are lost, it causes a breakdown of normal brain activity. This breakdown leads to the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nSOLUTION: The symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease come from the breakdown of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. When there is a loss of dopamine-producing cells, it leads to a lack of dopamine in the brain.\nThe lack of dopamine causes nine classic symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. The symptoms are presented in alphabetical order.\nA. Tremor. A tremor is an uncontrolled, repetitive movement. Parkinson\u2019s disease may cause a tremor in the hands, arms, legs, or jaw.\nB. Rigidity. Rigidity is stiffness of the muscles. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, rigidity may cause body parts to feel stiff, or they may feel like they are made of wood.\nC. Bradykinesia. Bradykinesia is a slowness of movement. Parkinson\u2019s disease may cause a person to move slowly, to speak softly, or to have difficulty with fine movements.\nD. Postural instability. Postural instability is an increased likelihood of falling. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, postural instability can make it difficult to maintain a stable position, such as standing or sitting up.\nE. Gait imbalance. Gait imbalance is an abnormality in the way a person walks. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, gait imbalance may include a wide turn or a shuffling gait.\nF. Limb rigidity.

For example, children whose parents use the Massachusetts Model may have:\nfewer conflicts between parents\nbetter relationships with both parents\nlower levels of anxiety and depression\nfewer behavior problems"}

At first, an infant's babbling is random, but it soon becomes a language-like sequence of sounds.\nDuring the first year of life, infants use babbling to explore the sounds of language. As infants babble, they produce different combinations of sounds. Some of these combinations are common to many languages, while others are specific to each language.\nSome languages have more sounds than others. For example, there are fewer sounds in a language like English than in a language like Samoan. Because of this difference, speakers of English use a different combination of sounds in their babbling than speakers of Samoan.\nSOLUTION: Infants from different language communities babble differently.\nInfants start babbling in different ways, depending on the sounds in their language. An infant's babbling is like a language from the beginning."}
{"question": "Child abuse and neglect are most associated with which of the following attachment patterns?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "disorganized/disoriented"}, {"label": "B", "text": "distant/disengaged."}, {"label": "C", "text": "insecure/avoidant."}, {"label": "D", "text": "insecure/ambivalent"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Attachment patterns are how you interact with others. This interaction is based on your relationships with your parents or caregivers.\nIf you have a secure attachment pattern, you tend to trust others and believe that they will be there for you. You can take risks and try new things because you feel that others will help you if you get into trouble.\nIf you have an insecure attachment pattern, you may not trust others or feel that they will be there for you. You may try to keep your distance emotionally. This is because you have difficulty believing that others will be there for you.\nAttachment patterns can change. You can learn to trust others, or you can learn to be wary of them.\nSOLUTION: Child abuse and neglect are most associated with a disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern.\nChildren who are abused or neglected may have trouble organizing their thoughts and feelings about others. They may feel confused or mixed up about how to interact with others."}

Random assignment ensures that each group is made up of people who are as similar as possible in terms of their baseline variables. This ensures that any differences between the groups can be attributed to the treatment.\nTo increase external validity, researchers can use a convenience sample. A convenience sample is a sample of people who are easy to recruit or find. This can help ensure that the sample is representative of the population.\nTo increase external validity, researchers can use a large sample. A large sample allows researchers to use statistical controls to increase the external validity of the study. For example, a researcher can use statistical controls to ensure that the sample is representative of the population in terms of age, gender, and race.\nManipulating the independent variable is not a way to increase external validity. In fact, manipulating the independent variable is one way to decrease external validity."}

The unconscious mind is made up of parts that are not available to the conscious mind. These parts are the personal unconscious, the collective unconscious, and the transcendent.\nThe personal unconscious is made up of memories and experiences that are not currently in the conscious mind but can be brought into it.\nThe collective unconscious is a shared database of information that is inherited from our ancestors. It contains types of memories and experiences that are not related to an individual's life.\nThe transcendent is a realm that is completely beyond our mind. It is the source of symbols and archetypes, which are universal images that appear in the conscious and unconscious minds of people all over the world.\nJung also believed that there is a process called individuation, in which an individual becomes more conscious and in control of their life. This process is better understood by looking at the symbolic and archetypal aspects of the unconscious mind.\nSOLUTION: This phenomenon is taking place when contents of the personal unconscious are projected onto the analyst.\nAnima-animus conflict and fantasy are related to the personal unconscious.\nAnima-animus conflict is a conflict between the female and male parts of the personality.\nFantasy is a way that the personal unconscious affects the conscious mind.\nThe exchange of symbols is related to the collective unconscious.\nTransference is related to both the personal and collective unconscious."}

People have an expectancy that their actions will be effective in achieving a desired outcome. This expectancy, or expectation, is the basis for their motivation.\nExpectancy is a person's belief about the probability that a particular action will lead to a desired outcome. Valence is a person's belief about the value of that outcome.\nValence is dependent on the employee's beliefs about the inherent value of the work itself and the value of the rewards for successful performance.\nAn employee's motivation and organizational commitment is a measure of the strength of the employee's motivation and commitment to the organization. This measure is affected by the employee's valence and expectancy.\nThe strength of the effort (versus ability) component of the worker's motivation refers to the extent to which the employee is motivated by a need to put forth effort or to demonstrate ability. This component is determined by the employee's valence and expectancy.\nSOLUTION: Expectancy theory predicts that worker motivation depends on several factors including \"valence,\" which refers to the employee's beliefs about the value of rewards provided for successful performance.\nThe correct answer is A."}
