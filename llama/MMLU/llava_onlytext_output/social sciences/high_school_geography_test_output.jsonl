People in traditional economies grow their own food and make their own goods. They do not need to trade with others to meet their basic needs.\nTraditional economies have many small-scale, self-sufficient farms and businesses. These farms and businesses produce the food and goods that people need to live.\nProduction is not organized on a large scale. So, traditional economies cannot rely on trade to fuel their economic growth.\nIn modern economies, people use money to buy goods and services. Money makes it easier to trade goods and services than to produce them all yourself.\nMany people do not have to grow their own food or make their own goods. They can specialize in other tasks, such as making machinery or providing services. This specialization allows businesses to grow and economies to prosper.\nSOLUTION: Subsistence economies lack a currency. Money is a currency. It is used to exchange goods and services."}

In politics, a centrifugal force can be an issue that pushes people or regions away from the center of a country.\nFor example, religious differences were a centrifugal force in Yugoslavia, which broke apart in the 1990 s. People in Yugoslavia were divided into different religions, and this divide led to social and political tensions.\nA centrifugal force can also be a nationalist movement. Nationalists believe that people who share a common history, culture, or language should form their own country. In some cases, nationalists believe that their country is being ruled by an oppressive government.\nThe Irish Republican Army was a centrifugal force in Northern Ireland for many years. The IRA wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and unite with the Republic of Ireland."}

As a population's country becomes more developed, its population will undergo the demographic transition.\nThe demographic transition has four stages:\nStage 1: High birth rates and high death rates. In this stage, life expectancy is short, and both birth rates and death rates are high.\nStage 2: High birth rates and declining death rates. In this stage, life expectancy begins to increase, and the death rate decreases. But the birth rate is still high.\nStage 3: Low birth rates and declining death rates. In this stage, life expectancy continues to increase, the death rate decreases, and the birth rate falls.\nStage 4: Low birth rates and high death rates. In this stage, life expectancy is high, and the death rate is low.

This choice is called international production.\nThere are several reasons why a company might choose to international produce:\nTo access new markets: International production can give a company access to new markets. For example, a company based in Japan might decide to open a factory in China to sell to customers in Asia.\nTo reduce costs: International production can also help a company reduce costs. For example, a company based in the United States might decide to open a factory in Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs.\nTo take advantage of specialization: Companies can also international produce to take advantage of specialization. For example, a company based in South Korea might specialize in the production of memory chips, while a company based in the United States specializes in the production of computer systems. The two companies can trade with each other to produce a computer system with memory chips.\nSOLUTION: A transnational corporation is a company that has operations in more than one country.

He thought that land prices increase as you move out from the center of the city. The land around the center is used for the most valuable, most expensive land. The land farther out is used for less valuable, less expensive land.\nRostow believed that cities grow in stages. First, there is a germinal center, or the initial settlement. Then, a suburb grows around the germinal center. Eventually, a central business district develops. Eventually, the central business district is replaced by a newer center of growth.\nBurgess believed that cities have multiple centers. He thought that each center grows in a spreading, circular pattern. The result is a pattern of interconnected circles.\nRavenstein believed that cities grow outward from the center in a wavelike pattern. The land closest to the center is developed first.

An urban hierarchy is a way of ranking cities by their function and size.\nThere are five different models of urban hierarchy. Two of them are shown in the figure below.\nCentral place theory: In this model, cities are organized around central places, such as stores or factories. The central place is the most important part of the city. The hierarchy of a central place theory city is described by its population. The largest cities are at the top of the hierarchy.\nSOLUTION: The rank-size rule is a model of urban hierarchy. The rank-size rule says that cities of equal size have equal rank. This model is shown by the chart below.\nPopulation | Rank\n100,000 | 1\n50,000 | 2\n25,000 | 3\n10,000 | 4\n5,000 | 5\nThe population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank in the hierarchy. This means that the population of a city is directly related to its rank. For example, the population of the second-rank city is half the population of the first-rank city."}

These countries have many older people and a smaller number of younger people. As a result of this population aging, these countries have a smaller workforce and a higher number of older people who need social support. This can put a strain on government resources.\nGovernments can do several things to support their aging populations. For example, they can:\n1. Increase the age of mandatory schooling: By doing this, there will be a larger number of people in the workforce for a longer period of time.\n2. Increase the retirement age: This allows people to continue working and supporting themselves. It also reduces the number of people receiving social support.\n3. Encourage higher birthrates: This will increase the number of people in the workforce and decrease the number of older people receiving social support."}

Some of the factors that can influence gender roles in a culture or society include its history, religion, and economics.\nA society's history may include its experience with women in nontraditional roles, such as in the military or in government. A society's religion may determine whether it is considered masculine or feminine to pursue certain occupations or take on particular roles within the family. A society's economics may determine the types of occupations that are available to men and women.\nIn some societies, gender is assigned a different degree of importance. For example, in some societies, gender is considered a more important factor in determining a person's role in the family.

It is the simplest and most intuitive of the location theories.\nThe central place theory states that the number and size of central places in a region depend on the size of the region and the distance between the population center and the central places.\nThe size of a central place is determined by the number of people who live within a certain distance of the central place. This distance is called the transfer distance.\nThe region's population center is the largest center of population. Other central places are located on a radius from the population center.\nThe size of a central place is determined by the number of people who live within its transfer distance.

The angle of the rays changes as the Sun moves across the sky. This change means that different parts of the Earth's surface get sunlight from the Sun at different times.\nThe position of a location on the Earth's surface also affects the climate. Locations near the equator get sunlight from the Sun for a longer part of the day than locations closer to the poles.\nThe type of land a location is on also affects its climate. Land and water absorb and lose heat in different ways. This affects the temperature of the air around them.\nSOLUTION: The climate of Great Britain is milder than most other places along the same latitude for several reasons.\nThe Gulf Stream is a current that flows from the Caribbean Sea to the coast of Great Britain. The current is part of the Atlantic Ocean's circulation pattern.\nThe Gulf Stream brings warm waters to Great Britain, raising the temperature of winds that blow onto the island.\nHot springs throughout the country raise the temperature of the surrounding land and air.\nMountain ranges in the north of Great Britain act as a barrier to cold winds blowing from the Arctic.\nThe Himalayan mountain range acts as a barrier to cold winds from the Arctic.\nSmall landmasses generate their own local climate and are largely unaffected by latitude.\nEven though Iceland is near the Arctic Circle, it has a milder climate. This is because Iceland is warmest country on the same latitude as Alaska. This is because of the Gulf Stream."}
