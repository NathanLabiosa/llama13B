But in the past, environmental changes have sometimes undermined national security. For example, drought has decreased agricultural production in some countries, which has weakened their economies and their military capabilities.\nEnvironmental problems can also lead to social unrest and instability. This can make a country more vulnerable to external threats. In addition, the resources needed to maintain a strong military can be diverted from other important uses, such as addressing the effects of climate change or developing new technologies.\nSOLUTION: Balancing environmental changes and national security interests is a complex issue.

Security studies is the study of the production and distribution of security.\nSecurity is produced through social interactions and institutions. Some security is produced through formal institutions, such as governments and international organizations. Other security is produced through informal institutions, such as religious groups and gangs.\nSecurity is distributed unequally. Some people and groups have more security than others. For example, wealthy people have more security than poor people. White people have more security than black people. Men have more security than women. People in powerful countries have more security than people in weak countries.\nCritical Security Studies is a critical approach to the study of security. A critical approach is an approach that questions dominant ideas and practices. In the case of security studies, a critical approach questions the dominant ideas and practices of mainstream security studies.\nFor example, a critical security scholar might question the idea that more security can be produced through military means. This idea is a dominant idea of mainstream security studies. A critical scholar might look at the ways that the production of military security often leads to more insecurity for some people and groups. She might look at the ways that the production of military security is part of a larger system of power.\nSOLUTION: The third principle is not one of the unifying principles of Critical Security Studies, as defined by Krause.

Power can be used to deter or defeat other states, and the acquisition of power can increase a state's bargaining leverage.\nDefensive realism regards cooperation as the way in which states can achieve security. Cooperation is safer than competition because it is less likely to provoke war. States can also achieve security through power, but they choose to cooperate when the costs of war are too high.\nBoth defensive realism and offensive realism regard power and competition as a means by which security can be achieved for the state."}

The process of state-building is long term, and a state's survival is contingent on its ability to attain a monopoly of control over violence. When a state is unable to do so, its survival is jeopardized.\nFor example, in the Middle Ages, European states faced the challenge of maintaining order in a society that was often at odds. Many European states were able to attain a monopoly of control over violence, which allowed them to consolidate their power and survive. But other states were not so lucky. As a result of ongoing conflict, these states were unable to consolidate their power, and their sovereignty was often contested.\nIn the contemporary context of global society, the utility of comparing weak state insecurity to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand. International norms have permeated the global society, and many states now face the challenge of maintaining order in a society that is less violent. As a result, the contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms.\nThe right to inviolability of statehood is a particular problematic rule. Without protection under international laws, the possibility of a state's national status being revoked and its territory being subsumed into another state threatens the consolidation of the state-building process.

They can undermine national and international security, as well as economic and social stability. The term pandemic refers to a disease that has spread throughout a large area. Pandemics can be caused by any type of infectious disease, including influenza.\nMost pandemics begin with a new strain of the virus or bacteria that causes the disease. This new strain may be a mutated version of a disease that has existed for many years. As the new strain spreads, people have no natural immunity to it. This means that the disease can spread quickly and widely.\nThe first cholera pandemic began in the mid-1800s and spread to many parts of the world. Cholera is a bacterial infection that can cause severe diarrhea and dehydration. It can kill a person in a few days.\nThe cholera outbreaks in London in 1854 and 1866 may have contributed to the rapid spread of the pandemic. At the time, many people in London were living in poor conditions. The city's water supply was also contaminated.\nSOLUTION: The last statement characterizes our understanding of disease pandemics within the contemporary international political system.\nInfectious disease transcends international borders and, to some extent, divisions of class, gender, education, and wealth.\nWhilst pandemics present a direct risk to national security, they also have the potential to undermine wider international stability.\nLike terrorism, pandemics present a set of threats and risks that are diverse yet interconnected.\nThe existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious disease within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks."}

To understand the international political system, it is necessary to examine the ways in which states interact and the different structures that influence them.\nAnarchy is the absence of a higher authority to interpret and enforce the rules of the international system. In the absence of a global government, states are free to pursue their own policies. Anarchy explains why states are cautious about military buildups and why they seek to avoid war. War is a direct threat to a state's survival, and states cannot rely on a higher authority to protect them.\nPower is the ability to affect the behavior of other states. States can use power to protect their interests, achieve their objectives, and maintain their survival. Power can be used for both cooperative and competitive purposes.\nTerrorism is the use of violence to achieve a political goal. States may use terrorism to coerce other states or to retaliate for attacks. The September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States are an example of terrorism.\nInsurgents are groups or individuals that use violence to destabilize a state. They may seek to overthrow an existing government or to force a change in policy.\nSOLUTION: The weak state security dilemma is an inescapable condition.\nWeak states have little power and few resources. They often have large territories and small populations, and they may be plagued by poverty, disease, and environmental degradation. These factors can make it difficult for weak states to maintain their security.\nThe problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism.

However, the slow growth or recession that many of these countries have experienced since the 1990s has raised questions about the effectiveness of traditional policies for promoting economic growth and reducing poverty.\nStructural adjustment policies were promoted as a way to alleviate these problems. Proponents of these policies argue that they can help developing countries grow by improving the business climate, enhancing export competitiveness, and increasing investment. Critics, however, argue that these policies have often resulted in economic hardship and increased poverty.\nSOLUTION: The existing legacy of structural adjustment policies is a matter of ongoing debate. Some proponents argue that these policies have helped developing countries by promoting economic growth and macroeconomic stability. For example, they point to the success stories of countries such as China, Korea, and Taiwan.\nCritics, however, argue that the negative impacts of structural adjustment policies have fallen disproportionately on the poor. For example, policies that increase interest rates and reduce government spending can drive up unemployment and dampen economic growth. In addition, policies that focus on export crops or products can increase poverty and inequality, as small farmers and workers find it difficult to compete with large-scale producers."}

Epistemic violence is the violence of the categories and assumptions that are so much a part of our everyday lives that they go unnoticed.\nStructural violence is the violence of inequality and the structures that produce and maintain that inequality. This form of violence is ongoing and persistent. It is not usually violent in the dramatic and immediate sense, but it is far more lethal. Structural violence is the violence of conditions and environments that make death and suffering inevitable.\nPervasive violence is the violence that is woven into the fabric of our society, the violence that is so ordinary that it goes unnoticed.

It is based on the idea that world politics is a constant struggle for power. Realists argue that this struggle is driven by the pursuit of power and the fear of attack. They believe that states are the most powerful actors in the international system, and that they will do whatever it takes to protect themselves from attack.\nOne of the key assumptions of realism is that states are the main actors in the international system. This assumption leads realists to focus on the activities of states and to ignore the activities of other actors, such as international organizations or transnational groups.\nAnother key assumption of realism is that the international system is characterized by anarchy. This means that there is no overarching authority to govern the behavior of states. Realists argue that this anarchy leads to a situation in which states must rely on themselves to survive.\nA realist perspective on war begins with an understanding of the importance of power. Realists argue that states are motivated to engage in war by a desire to increase their own power and to decrease the power of other states.\nA state's power can be measured by its military strength, its economic resources, and its political influence. States use military strength to defend themselves against attack, to coerce other states, and to achieve their political objectives. States use economic resources and political influence to protect themselves from attack and to achieve their political objectives.\nRealists also argue that the international system is a competitive arena. In this arena, states are motivated to be the most powerful state. States can be the most powerful state by having the most military strength, the most economic resources, or the most political influence.\nRealists argue that the outbreak of war is most likely when the offence-defence balance of the international system favors offence. An offence-defence balance of offence means that states are focused on attacking other states. A defensive balance of offence means that states are focused on defending themselves against attack.\nA realist would expect the following situations to increase the likelihood of war:\nAn increase in the military strength of a state or a group of states.\nAn increase in the political tension between states.\nA change in the balance of power in the international system."}

The United States saw the world in terms of a communist threat, while the Soviet Union saw the world in terms of a capitalist threat. This competition between the two superpowers, and their different views of the world, led to the development of two distinct theoretical approaches to international relations: realism and idealism.\nRealism is a theory of international relations that emphasizes the anarchic and competitive nature of the international system. It sees states as the most important actors in the international system and asserts that they are primarily responsible for coercion and conflict. Realism focuses on the pursuit of power and the security concerns of states.\nIdealism is a theory of international relations that emphasizes the cooperative and interdependent nature of the international system. It sees states as being part of a larger global community and asserts that they are primarily responsible for cooperation and peace. Idealism focuses on the shared values and concerns of states.\nHistorical materials: The United States and the Soviet Union were the two superpowers during the Cold War. They had different views of the world, which led to the development of two distinct theoretical approaches to international relations: realism and idealism.\nThe United States saw the world in terms of a communist threat. It viewed the Soviet Union as a threat to the security of the United States and its allies. In response to this perceived threat, the United States developed a realist approach to international relations. Realism focused on the pursuit of power and the security concerns of states. It emphasized military strength, alliances, and the balance of power.\nThe Soviet Union saw the world in terms of a capitalist threat. It viewed the United States and its allies as a threat to the security of the Soviet Union and its allies. In response to this perceived threat, the Soviet Union developed an idealist approach to international relations. Idealism focused on the pursuit of peace and the shared values of states. It emphasized cooperation, disarmament, and the rule of law.\nThe Cold War was a period of intense competition and conflict between the two superpowers. It was also a period of great upheaval and change. The United States and the Soviet Union fought wars in Korea and Vietnam. They also competed in space and in the realm of ideas. The Cold War also saw the growth of international organizations, such as the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nThe Cold War ended in the 1990s. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the Cold War. The United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\nSince the end of the Cold War, the United States has been the dominant actor in international relations. It has used its military and economic power to promote its interests and values. The United States has also been a leader in the spread of democracy and the rule of law.\nSOLUTION: Historically, human geography was developed during the Cold War. It emerged as a response to the geopolitical concerns of the United States and its allies. Human geography was seen as a way to understand the world in terms of a communist threat. It focused on the geographic distribution of resources and people. This approach was useful for understanding the global impact of the Cold War.\nDuring the Cold War, human geography was often associated with a critical perspective on United States foreign policy. This perspective focused on the negative consequences of United States actions in other parts of the world.\nFollowing the Cold War, human geography broadened its focus. It began to study the cultural, economic, and political impact of global processes on people. The cultural impact of global processes includes the spread of popular culture and the growth of global cities. The economic impact of global processes includes the growth of multinational corporations and the increasing integration of the world economy. The political impact of global processes includes the rise of international organizations and the growth of global governance."}

This definition of class is different from the way class is defined in other countries, or even in American society.\nClass and money are related, but they are not the same. For example, getting a raise at work will increase a person's income, but it may not change the person's class. Similarly, being born into a wealthy family does not necessarily mean that a person is part of the ruling class.\nTheory: HM is a paradigm, or a set of ideas and beliefs, that explains how class in America is organized. HM states that class in America is organized into a simple division between a capitalist ruling class and a working class.\nHM does not recognize other forms of class, such as professional classes, or classes based on education or ethnicity.

The idea behind humanitarian intervention is that sovereignty should not be a bar to the international community's efforts to prevent human suffering.\nHumanitarian intervention raises important questions about the relationship between state sovereignty and human rights. It is a delicate issue, and there are several reasons why the case for humanitarian intervention is limited:\nIt is not self-evident that individuals do have universal and fundamental human rights. Some theorists claim that human rights are not universal but are the inventions of specific societies, or that they are the result of international law. If this is true, then humanitarian intervention is not justified.\nAdvocates of humanitarian intervention exaggerate the extent of global consensus about the use of force to protect human rights. Many states are wary of humanitarian intervention, and some states oppose it. This means that the use of force to protect human rights is not a universally accepted principle of state conduct.\nAny norm endorsing the use of force to protect individual rights could be abused by powerful states. States that wield significant military power may be tempted to use humanitarian intervention as a pretext to achieve their own objectives."}

This definition can have important consequences, such as the diversion of resources and the curtailment of civil liberties.\nSecuritization is not always a linear process, and the adoption of extraordinary measures does not necessarily indicate that a situation is an existential threat. For example, a state may use the idea of a terrorist threat to justify increased security measures, even though the threat may not be as extreme as the state is portraying it.\nSecuritization can be a self-fulfilling process, as the adoption of extraordinary measures can itself convince an audience of the existential threat.

Without information, you are unaware of the possible actions you could take and the consequences of those actions. How can you make the best choice when you have little or no information?\nInformation affects the decision-making process in three ways. It tells you about the particular choices that are available. It tells you about the consequences of each action. And it tells you about the future.\nConsequences affect the decision-making process because they determine the outcome of each action. Outcomes are what you want or need. However, you can't always get what you want. Some actions may have bad consequences.\nUncertainty affects the decision-making process because it is impossible to have complete information. There are always uncertainties and risks. Uncertainties are situations in which the future is unknown. Risks are uncertainties that involve possible harm or loss.\nSOLUTION: Information plays a significant role in decision making. Rational action depends on the information available to actors. In the economic science of decision making, theory assumes that actors act in their own best interest. But best interests depend on the information that is available.\nFor example, consider a person deciding whether to have an expensive surgical procedure. The decision depends on many factors. What is the likelihood of success? What are the risks and benefits? What will it cost?\nThe person's decision is based on the information he has. If he has a lot of information, he will make a better decision than if he has little information.\nInformation can also affect the selling of goods and services. In the 21st century, information has become an important resource. Information can be sold and traded as a market commodity."}

Some people believe that security is primarily a matter of protecting a state and its people from military attack. Others believe that security is also about preventing non-military threats, such as epidemics and environmental disasters, from causing harm.\nThe Copenhagen School is one of the most influential approaches to the study of security. This view of security is defined below.\nSecurity is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective.\nThis statement defines security as a concept that is created and perceived differently in different societies.

Institutions can constrain or encourage particular courses of action, and they may do so equally across all actors or differently across different actors.\nInstitutions can be devised by governments, but they also include customary norms and other social conventions. For example, social norms may make it unacceptable to litter in a public park, even though there are no enforcers present to catch you in the act.\nInstitutions can also affect aggregate economic patterns. For example, institutions that foster innovation can lead to economic growth, while institutions that do not enforce contracts may deter investment.\nSOLUTION: Institutional constraints affect behavior by setting the rules and norms that govern a society. Institutions shape the incentives and constraints that affect the choices of individuals, and they do so by setting the rules and norms that govern a society.\nFor example, property rights are an institution. They construct the rules that determine who has the right to use and transfer different resources. Property rights also create incentives for people to invest their time and resources in acquiring and protecting those resources.\nInstitutions can also affect aggregate economic patterns.

Coercive diplomacy can involve threats to use military force, economic sanctions, or other forms of pressure to persuade an adversary to change its behavior.\nCoercive diplomacy can be an effective way to resolve international conflicts. The success of coercive diplomacy, however, depends on the credibility of the threat and the adequacy of the incentives offered in exchange for compliance. If the threat is not credible, or if the incentives are not adequate, the policy may fail.\nThe United States has used coercive diplomacy many times in its history. In 1998, for example, the United States used coercive diplomacy to persuade Iraq to allow UN inspectors to search for weapons of mass destruction. The threat of military action was coupled with the incentive of avoiding war. The policy was successful, and Iraq allowed the inspections to go forward."}

This definition has important implications for both the issue and its potential buyers. Once an issue is defined as a security, regulations governing the issue's sale and trading will apply. These regulations may limit the ability of the issuer to raise capital and may protect the issue's buyers from unscrupulous sellers.\nSecuritization can occur in one of two ways: through a public sale or through a private placement. A public sale takes place in the market, where investment banks or other institutions buy the issue. A private placement takes place outside the market, where the issuer sells the issue to an investor.\nThere are three criteria that must be met for an issue to be defined as a security. The first criterion is that the issue is an investment. An investment is a financial asset. Financial assets are thought to be risky: they have a price, but that price can go up or down. The second criterion is that the issue is a fungible. Fungible assets are interchangeable. One dollar invested in an issue is the same as another dollar invested in the same issue. The third criterion is that the issue is a negotiable. Negotiable assets can be bought and sold.\nIf an issue fails any one of the three criteria, it is not a security. For example, a loan is not a security. A loan is an investment, but it is not a fungible: two dollars loaned is not the same as another two dollars loaned. A loan is also not negotiable: you cannot sell a loan."}

Security is also the absence of harm. People seek security from violence, disease, and nature.\nThe traditional conception of security is based on the idea that military security is paramount to the state. This idea is rooted in the ancient Greek city-state, which sought to protect itself from attack by other city-states.\nIn this view, the state is the referent object, and security is the absence of threat to the state. The state needs to protect its citizens and its territory from other states and from international terrorism, disease, and natural disasters.\nThe traditional conception of security has been challenged by scholars who question its effectiveness and its ethical foundations. Changes in the nature of war, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and the increasing importance of non-state actors have led many to call for a broader, more flexible approach to security.\nCritics argue that the traditional conception of security is too narrow, too focused on military power, and too oriented to the interests of states. They call for a more comprehensive approach that takes into account non-state actors, such as transnational terrorist networks, and non-traditional security threats, such as pandemics and climate change.\nSOLUTION: The agenda to question the traditional conception of military security as paramount to the state and to change the way in which security is studied would attract scholars to the broad church of security studies.\nThis agenda questions the referent object, the traditional conception of security, and the way in which security is studied.

Liberalism was about expanding freedom and promoting tolerance, or the freedom to do your own thing. However, in the late 18th century, the idea of human rights began to take hold. Human rights are fundamental to liberalism because they protect individuals from harmful government actions.\nThe idea of human rights grew out of the Enlightenment, a period of intense intellectual and artistic activity that took place from the late 17th century to the late 18th century. Enlightenment thinkers argued that all people have certain fundamental rights. These rights are not granted by governments. Instead, people have them by nature of being human.\nTwo of the most important human rights are the right to freedom and the right to equality.\nThe right to freedom means that people can live their lives as they choose. The government cannot tell people what to do or think.\nThe right to equality means that people are equal in the eyes of the law. People are equal not because they are the same but because they are all people.\nLiberalism and human rights share a concern for the freedom and equality of individuals. But liberalism is mainly focused on limiting the power of government. Human rights are mainly focused on protecting people from harm.\nSOLUTION: Modern human rights oriented liberalism is concerned with self-determination. Self-determination is the right of people to rule themselves. This right is part of the human rights tradition.\nHuman rights orientated liberalism will advocate separatism where conflict and bloodshed seem inevitable without it. Liberalism is mainly focused on limiting the power of government. But when the government engages in gross violations of human rights, liberalism can justify intervention.\nHuman rights orientated liberalism is particularly focused on persons subject to economic, sexual, gender, religious, and political persecution, discrimination, or deprivation. Many liberal interventions have been aimed at protecting these people.\nAll of these options are ways that the preoccupation with human rights affects the human rights orientated school of liberalism."}

This view assumes that states act as rational actors, deliberately choosing the time and place for war. According to this view, war is the continuation of politics by other means.\nHowever, this view is too simple. It fails to take into account the complexity of the international system, in which several actors make decisions at the same time, and in which there are many types of issues and types of possible actions. For example, what states want to accomplish in war is not always clear. Do states seek to win a war, or do they simply want to use a war to achieve their political goals? How states define their political goals can depend on their perception of what is happening in the international system. For example, states may be motivated to go to war if they perceive that the international system is moving in a direction that they find undesirable.\nFurthermore, the view that war is a rational instrument of political policy does not take into account the fact that states are not the only actors in the international system. Many other types of actors, such as non-state actors, may be able to affect the outcomes of wars.\nA social aberration is a deviation from the norm in society. One way to understand war is as a social aberration, or a deviation from the norm of peace. This view emphasizes the normative aspect of war, or the fact that war is different from the normal behavior of states. According to this view, war is the result of catastrophic failure in social cohesion.\nThis view is supported by the fact that states have many ways to accomplish their goals other than war. For example, states can use diplomacy to achieve their goals. The use of diplomacy shows that war is an anomaly, or a deviation from the norm.\nWar as an anarchic state is a view that emphasizes the global structure of the international system. In this view, the international system is an anarchic state, which is a system without an overarching government. In such a system, state actors must draw upon exceptional (military) means in order to ensure the protection of their interests.\nThis view emphasizes the fact that states are surrounded by other states. States that are surrounded by other states need to be able to defend themselves. States that are unable to defend themselves will be attacked. So, to protect themselves, state actors must be able to defend themselves. They must be able to use military means to defend themselves.\nWar as a state of mass conflict which is inflicted upon state actors as a result of their failure to effectively control the behavior of their population is a view that emphasizes the domestic aspect of war. According to this view, war is a state of mass conflict that is inflicted upon state actors when they fail to control the behavior of their population.\nThis view emphasizes the fact that states are made up of people. When the people in a state are not happy, they may behave in ways that cause their state to enter into war. For example, if people in a state are unhappy, they may engage in protests that could lead their state to war.\nSOLUTION: War is an anarchic state in which state or other actors must draw upon exceptional (military) means in order to ensure the protection of their interests. This view is the best way to understand the relationship between war, military security, and security studies.\nMilitary security is the protection of a state's security from military attack. Security studies is the study of military security."}

Coercive diplomacy can involve demands that a state change its policies or behavior, or that it agree to certain terms.\nThe strategy of coercive diplomacy has several elements. It includes a threat to use force if a state does not comply with a demand. The threat may be overt, or it may be implied. Coercive diplomacy also involves the offer of incentives, or rewards, for complying with a demand. The incentives may be direct, or they may be indirect.\nThe goal of coercive diplomacy is to persuade a state to do what is wanted. The success of coercive diplomacy depends on the strength of a country's threats and incentives, as well as on the costs that a state will incur if it does not comply with a demand.\nDeterrence is a form of coercive diplomacy in which a state threats to use force if another state does not comply with a demand. Deterrence can be effective only if the threatening state is willing to use force if necessary.\nCompellence is a form of coercive diplomacy in which a state uses force or the threat of force to make a state do what is wanted.

In order to protect this diversity, there exists a need for unifying principles of humanitarian intervention."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Humanitarian intervention is when one state decides to intervene in the affairs of another state in order to protect its citizens from suffering or persecution. This type of intervention can take many different forms, including military action, economic sanctions, and diplomatic pressure.\nThe case for humanitarian intervention is made when it is believed that a state is not fulfilling its duty to protect its citizens from harm. This duty is based on the concept of sovereignty, which means that states have the right to govern themselves without interference from other states. However, if a state is harming its own people, then other states can step in to stop this harm.\nThe diversity of the current global international system impacts upon the case for humanitarian intervention in a number of ways. One way is that there are many different cultural, political, and religious values represented in the global system. This diversity can make it difficult to agree on what actions should be taken to protect citizens from harm. For example, some states may believe that military action is necessary to stop a government from harming its people, while other states may believe that economic sanctions are a more appropriate response.\nAnother way that the diversity of the global international system affects the case for humanitarian intervention is that there are many different rules and norms about how states should govern themselves and each other. Some states may follow a paradigm of human-security, which promotes human security based on core assumptions of what it is to be secure, and which transcend cultural or political diversity. Other states may be more focused on state-sovereignty, which means that states have the right to govern themselves without interference from other states. These different rules and norms can lead to disagreements about whether humanitarian intervention is necessary or appropriate.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D. This answer begins by noting that there are many different views about how states should govern themselves and each other in the contemporary global arena. These different views make it difficult to agree on unifying principles of humanitarian intervention. The answer then explains that within the global system there are a number of states, in terms of their cultural, political, ideological, and religious values, that are characterized by radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity, there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention."}

This process can lead to a series of responses that, in turn, can make the issue appear more urgent and dangerous. As a result of these responses, the securitization of an issue can lead to a sustained mobilization of public support and the allocation of resources.\nSecuritization involves three parties: the person who securitizes an issue, the audience that receives the securitized issue, and the topic of the issue that is being securitized.\nA person securitizes an issue by using language that emphasizes the issue's urgency and danger. For example, a politician might call for a ban on a certain chemical by saying that the chemical is a \"potential threat to public health.\"\nThe audience receives the securitized issue as a security threat. As a result of this framing, the audience is likely to overestimate the probability and imminence of the threat. For example, many people in an affected area might support a ban on the chemical, even though the area's soil samples show that the chemical is not present in dangerous quantities.\nThe topic of the securitized issue is often changed as a result of the securitization. For example, the chemical in the previous example is now framed as a security threat rather than a public health threat. This framing can lead to a different set of responses, such as increased military research on the chemical.\nSOLUTION: This statement is commonly regarded as a tangible benefit of the securitization process: Securitization mobilizes popular support for policies in specific areas by calling them security relevant and encourages the allocation of more resources."}

These ideas are called a political philosophy. A society's political philosophy may contain ideas about the best ways to organize the government and the economy.\nPolitical philosophies can have a major impact on the way a country is governed. Some political philosophies are based on the idea of individualism, which stresses the rights and freedoms of individuals. Other political philosophies are based on the idea of collectivism, which stresses the needs of groups.\nSome important political philosophies include the philosophy of ancient China, which stressed the harmony of the universe and the roles of society and the state in creating a peaceful and orderly world; the philosophy of ancient Greece, which emphasized the rights and responsibilities of citizens and the importance of democracy; the philosophy of the Enlightenment, which emphasized the power of reason and science to improve society; and the philosophy of socialism, which stresses the importance of the community and the state in ensuring economic justice.\nSOLUTION: Historical materialism is a political philosophy that is based on the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. They believed that the economy is the most important part of society. They also believed that throughout history, there have been two types of societies: dominant capitalist societies and subordinate communist societies.\nDominant capitalist societies are societies in which a small group of people owns the factories, mines, and land. In these societies, most people have to work for a living. The capitalist owners of the factories, mines, and land are the ruling class. The people who work in the factories, mines, and fields are the working class.\nSubordinate communist societies are societies in which the working people own and control the factories, mines, and land. In these societies, there is no ruling class.\nHistorical materialism explains how capitalist and communist societies come into existence. According to historical materialism, the way the economy is organized affects how a society is organized. A capitalist economy is based on the private ownership of the means of production. This leads to a society in which some people have a lot of wealth and power, and others have little wealth and power. In a communist economy, the means of production are owned and controlled by the people. This leads to a society in which there is no ruling class."}

It can take the form of treaties that set limits on the number of weapons a state can have, the types of weapons it can have, or the ways it can use those weapons.\nDeterrence is the idea that potential enemies can be deterred from using weapons by the threat of retaliation. Deterrence can be based on the threat to use weapons, the ability to use weapons effectively, or the certainty that one will be caught and punished if one uses weapons.\nBoth arms control and deterrence can help to prevent the use of weapons. But they each have limitations.\nArms control is difficult to enforce. It requires trust between states, and states may cheat on their agreements.\nDeterrence can be difficult to establish. Potential enemies must be convinced that the costs of using weapons are higher than the benefits. And deterrence can fail if an enemy is prepared to accept the consequences of using weapons.\nSOLUTION: The strategies of arms control and deterrence have been used to address security threats beyond the realm of traditional military weapons. For example, nuclear weapons control strategies have been used to reduce the risk of proliferation and war in the realm of nuclear weapons. As a result, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms.\nEffective deterrence requires international cooperation. But cooperation can be hard to achieve in cyber(ed) warfare because it is difficult to verify compliance with rules or practices.\nArms control is unproblematic. Deterrence has failed because international cooperation cannot be reached and common rules or practices cannot be established."}

In this case, a government may increase military and law enforcement operations, work with other nations to fight terrorism, and use force to prevent or stop attacks.\nAs a crime, terrorism is perceived as an offense against the state. In this case, a government may increase law enforcement operations, use intelligence to prevent attacks, and work with other nations to apprehend and try suspected terrorists.\nAs a disease, terrorism is perceived as a problem that needs to be contained and cured. In this case, a government may increase security to protect its citizens and take steps to address the social and economic problems that may contribute to terrorism."}

Feudalism and capitalism are not the same, but historians can look for similarities and differences between them.\nAnother way to do historical analysis is to change one aspect of the past and look at how that change would affect the future. This can help you to see how a particular aspect of the past has influenced the present.\nFor example, how might the world be different today if the United States had not entered World War II?\nAn historian analyzing history in this way is using a thought experiment.\nSOLUTION: The first answer choice is a description of comparative analysis.\nThe second answer choice is a description of Eurocentrism.\nThe third answer choice is a description of Eurocentrism.\nThe fourth answer choice is a description of Eurocentrism."}

Each of these paradigms provides a set of lenses through which one can observe and explain global affairs. Some of the most significant paradigms include realism, liberalism, and constructivism.\nRealism focuses on the role of power and the state in world politics. It is based on the assumption that states are the most important actors in the international system and that they are constantly seeking to increase their power. Realists see the international system as a self-help system, in which states must ensure their own security. This paradigm is based on the notion of causality, or the belief that there are objective causes and effects in the world.\nLiberalism focuses on the role of trade and cooperation in world politics. It is based on the assumption that states can cooperate and that they have a common interest in promoting global welfare. Liberal theorists see the international system as a system of mutual dependence, in which states cannot be secure unless they cooperate. This paradigm is based on the notion of moral reasoning, or the belief that some actions are right or wrong in all circumstances.\nConstructivism focuses on the role of ideas and social norms in world politics. It is based on the assumption that states are not the only actors in the international system, but that they are also influenced by ideas, norms, and discourses. Social constructivists see the international system as a social construction, in which state identities and interests are shaped by underlying social and historical factors. This paradigm is based on the notion of intersubjective meanings, or the belief that states have different understandings of the world.\nSOLUTION: Realism and social constructivism differ in their theoretical focus. Realism focuses on the role of identity in international relations. It is based on the assumption that states are the main actors in the international system and that their behavior is shaped by their interests and identities. Realism is based in the notion of causality, or the belief that there are objective causes and effects in the world.\nSocial constructivism prioritizes the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. It is based on the assumption that states are not the only actors in the international system, but that they are also influenced by ideas, norms, and discourses. Social constructivism is based on the notion of intersubjective meanings, or the belief that states have different understandings of the world."}

Most terrorist acts are committed by groups or individuals who are seeking to achieve a political goal.\nThe prevention of terrorism involves a combination of measures to prevent attacks from taking place. These measures can be divided into the following categories:\nIntelligence and surveillance: Governments can collect information about potential terrorist threats before they act. This is often acquired through human sources, satellite imagery, and other technologies.\nSecurity and police measures: Governments can increase security at potential targets. This includes the use of security personnel, metal detectors, X-ray machines, and other security measures to keep potential terrorists from reaching their targets.\nProtective measures: Governments can protect their citizens by taking steps to reduce the impact of a terrorist act. This includes evacuations, emergency response plans, and other measures to limit the harm from a terrorist act.\nDiplomacy and intelligence: Governments can work to prevent terrorism by negotiating with terrorist groups and by using intelligence to prevent attacks."}
