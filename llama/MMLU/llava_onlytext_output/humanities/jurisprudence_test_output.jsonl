Rules can be created for different purposes.\nSome rules are power-conferring rules. These rules can help you gain an advantage over others. For example, the rules of basketball can help you gain an advantage over the other team.\nSome rules are informational rules. These rules can tell you about how things work. For example, the rule of gravity can tell you that objects will fall.\nSome rules are social rules. These rules can help you get along with other people. For example, the rule of not running in a crowded area can help you avoid harming others.\nA moral rule is a set of ideas about what is right and wrong. As a citizen, you can use your moral rules to guide your behavior. As a lawyer, you can use moral rules to help you decide what is right and wrong in a legal dispute.\nThe role of morality in law is a view about the relationship between moral rules and legal rules. The natural lawyer believes that legal rules are based on moral rules.\nHart's distinction between being obliged and having an obligation helps to explain the nature of legal rules. A legal rule is an obligation. You are obliged to follow a legal rule. A legal rule is also a power-conferring rule. The legal rules that make up a society's law give you power to resolve disputes and make you accountable for your actions."}

The POP is an imagined person in a position to decide what he wants for himself. He is assumed to be disinterested, in the sense that he does not want more for himself than he wants for others. As such, the POP is motivated by a desire to act justly.\nThe principle of equal basic liberties: Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberties compatible with a similar liberty for others.\nThe difference principle: Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged and attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.\nThe POP's motivation is to strike a balance between the two principles.

The following terms help to describe the parts of a complex arrangement and how they relate to each other:\nLegitimate domination: The acceptance of the authority of an institution or system by those who are subject to it. This acceptance is based on a belief that the institution or system is natural, normal, or inevitable.\nInstitution: A set of rules and customs that help to shape the behavior of a group of people. Institutions are formal, public, and sustained over time.\nLegitimacy: The acceptance of the authority of an institution or system by those who are subject to it. This acceptance is based on a belief that the institution or system is moral, just, and right.\nPower: The ability of an individual or a group to get others to do what they want.\nA society is a complex arrangement of institutions and social practices. To understand how a society functions, it is necessary to examine the way its parts fit together.\nSOLUTION: Weber argues that the development of capitalism in England was facilitated by certain features of the English legal system. In particular, he points to the following features:\nThe English legal system is based on the common law. The common law is a system of law that is developed and administered by judges. It is different from civil law, which is based on a written code.\nThe common law emphasizes the rights of property owners. The common law honors property rights and emphasizes the importance of enforcing contracts.\nThe common law is flexible. The common law is adapted to new situations. It allows for the creation of new legal rules and practices.\nTogether, these features of the English legal system helped to create an environment in which capitalism could develop.

This doctrine is fundamental to the rule of law and is a cornerstone of the U.S. legal system.\nStare decisis helps to ensure that similar cases are decided in a consistent manner. It has three basic components:\n1. Choices made by other judges have persuasive, but not controlling, authority.\n2. A judge may consider relevant precedent when deciding a case.\n3. If a judge finds that a precedent is applicable and persuasive, the judge is required to follow the precedent, except in rare circumstances.\nSubstantial performance is the idea that a party is not necessarily excused from performing an obligation if the performance is not complete. For example, a party is not excused from performing a contract just because the work is not finished by the deadline. Instead, a court may accept substantial performance as satisfaction of the obligation.\nCommercial impracticability is the idea that a party is not responsible for a failure to perform an obligation if the failure was due to circumstances that made the performance impossible. For example, a buyer is not responsible for a failure to perform an obligation to pay for goods if the failure was due to the buyer's business failing due to a flood.\nNolo contendere is a special plea that may be made by a criminal defendant. It means that the defendant does not contest the charges. A defendant who makes a nolo contendere plea may be found guilty, but the defendant may also argue that he should not be found guilty because he did not contest the charges.\nSOLUTION: Adherence to precedent is called the doctrine of stare decisis.

It asserts that there are fundamental differences between individual women, and that these differences should be celebrated, not denigrated. Difference feminism claims that there are inherent differences between men and women, and that these differences should be the basis of a feminist theory. Difference feminism does not seek to eliminate gender inequalities or to promote a more just society. Instead, difference feminism seeks to celebrate the differences between men and women.\nAccording to difference feminism, men and women have different conceptions of the feminist project. They see feminism as a movement that seeks to promote gender equality and to eliminate sex-based inequalities. Difference feminism, in contrast, sees feminism as a movement that celebrates the differences between men and women and that does not seek to eliminate gender-based inequalities.\nDifference feminism contends that women look to context, whereas men appeal to neutral, abstract notions of justice. According to difference feminism, women are more likely than men to consider the context in which an issue arises. Women are more likely than men to consider the social and historical context in which an issue arises. Men are more likely than women to appeal to neutral, abstract notions of justice.\nAccording to difference feminism, men are unable to comprehend their differences from women.

A legal system's rules can be made up of norms, which are standards of conduct expected of individuals, and habits of obedience, which are the responses that individuals ought to make to those norms.\nGrundnorm is a German word that can be translated to english as basic norm or fundamental norm. As the name implies, Kelsen's Grundnorm is the fundamental norm from which the other norms of a legal system can be derived. It is the ultimate source of a legal system's morality:\nAccording to Kelsen, every legal system has a Grundnorm, and the Grundnorm is the one norm that is not subject to any higher authority. It is the ultimate source of a legal system's morality because it is not justified by any other norm.\nThe constitution of a state is a set of rules that governs the government of a state. While the Grundnorm is the fundamental norm from which the other norms of a legal system can be derived, the constitution of a state is the set of rules that governs the government of a state:\nThe Grundnorm is a norm, and a constitution is a set of rules. So, the Grundnorm is not the same as a constitution.\nA presupposition that facilitates our understanding of the legal system is a brief explanation of the legal system that makes it easier to understand. It is not a norm, and it is not part of the legal system:\nThese presuppositions are not part of the legal system, but they help us understand the legal system.\nThe rule that distinguishes norms from habits of obedience is a principle that states that people are not accountable for accepting the norms of a legal system. People are accountable for obeying the norms of a legal system, but they are not accountable for accepting them:\nThis principle distinguishes norms from habits of obedience. Norms are standards of conduct that people are expected to follow. Habits of obedience are the responses that people are expected to make to those norms."}

The theory holds that there is a fundamental distinction between law and morality, and that law is binding only within a certain framework.\nThere are several aspects of legal positivism:\nIt regards law as commands.\nLaw is a set of rules that tell you what you must do. These rules are backed up by the threat of punishment.\nIt perceives a legal order as a closed logical system.\nA legal order is a system in which the rules for making laws are fixed. The rules for making laws are part of the legal order. So, the legal order is a closed system.\nIt regards morals and law as inseparable.\nLaw tells you what is right and what is wrong. But some acts that are wrong may not be against the law. Some acts that are against the law may not be wrong. This shows that law and morality are not always inseparable.\nIt espouses the view that there is no necessary connection between morality and law.\nLegal positivists think that there is a distinction between law and morality.

According to Marxist theory, capitalism is a class society, which means that different classes exist and that the relationships between those classes are relevant to the functioning of society. In capitalist societies, the ruling class is the class of capitalists, who own the means of production. The capitalist class has the power to control the means of production, and this power allows them to extract surplus value from the workers, who must sell their labor in order to live.\nA Marxist account of law rejects individual rights because they are an expression of a capitalist economy and are unnecessary in a socialist society. According to this view, individual rights are a product of capitalist society, and they serve to justify the existence of a capitalist economy. In a socialist society, where the means of production are owned by the workers, individual rights are not as necessary. Instead of having individual rights, a socialist society has a duty to distribute goods and services fairly.\nA Marxist account of law rejects individual rights because they are inconsistent with state control. According to this view, the state is the institution that enforces the law. In a capitalist society, the state is controlled by the ruling class, and the law serves the interests of the ruling class. An individual with individual rights is independent of the state, and this independence is inconsistent with the functioning of a capitalist state.\nMarx, Engels, and Lenin failed to provide a coherent analysis of rights. According to this view, Marx, Engels, and Lenin did not offer a clear and consistent view of rights.

This is because the injustice in the past only hurts people to the extent that they have already acquired resources.\nNozick's historical entitlement theory is a prominent example of a theory of this sort. He holds that each person's holdings are justified by their history of acquisition, even if that history includes injustice. So, for example, if you have inherited a fortune from an ancestor who gained that fortune through an unjust process such as theft or expropriation, then you have a just claim to that fortune.\nOne criticism of this theory is that if the distribution of goods in society is unjust, then those at the bottom always lose. This is because the people at the top of the distribution acquired their wealth through injustice, and since injustice can't be justified by the injustice that preceded it, those at the bottom lose.\nNozick's answer to this criticism is that if each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just. This is because the justness of a person's holdings is not affected by the justness of the distribution of holdings. So, if the distribution of holdings is unjust, then the total distribution of holdings is unjust. But if the distribution of holdings is just, then the total distribution of holdings is just."}

Realists reject the idea that law can be studied by simply looking at legal rules and the actions of legal officials. They claim that much of the reality of law cannot be understood by observing the formal rules and official practices of a legal system.\nInstead, realists argue that law should be understood by looking at the roles that legal officials play in society. These roles are defined by the social and political context in which legal officials operate. As a result, legal rules and official practices are shaped by these roles.\nThe realist approach to the study of law can be described as sceptical. It assumes that legal rules and official practices are not always in line with what they claim to be. For example, legal rules sometimes have unintended consequences, and official practices can be influenced by politics.\nSOLUTION: Scandinavian realists reject a metaphysical approach to law for the same reasons that many other realists do: because they think that a metaphysical approach is too abstract and disconnected from the social and political reality of law.\nA metaphysical approach to law looks at the nature of law itself. It tries to answer questions about the most basic features of law, such as whether law is based on morality. This approach is based on ideas that are often difficult to observe in the real world.\nIn contrast, Scandinavian realists look at the roles that legal officials play in society.

They also argue that the law tends to serve the interests of the wealthy and powerful.\nCritical legal theorists would reject the proposition that law is determinate. A determinate system is a system with clear rules and guidelines.

They had very different views about the state of nature, the social contract, and the role of the state.\nHobbes saw the state of nature as a state of war, in which people are constantly in competition with each other. He believed that the state of war could be avoided only by giving up some freedom and establishing a social contract. Under the social contract, people would give up some of their freedom in exchange for the security of a strong, central authority. This authority would be responsible for protecting individuals' rights and resolving conflicts.\nLocke, on the other hand, saw the state of nature as a state of perfect freedom. He believed that people were equal in the state of nature and that they could continue to live in this state if they followed a few simple rules, such as not harming other people. According to Locke, the social contract was not necessary for the state to arise. Rather, people could voluntarily choose to come together and set up a government to help resolve conflicts and protect their rights."}

These rules define conduct that is illegal and require people to follow them. In some cases, people may be punished for breaking these rules.\nWhy do governments make legal rules? One reason is to help keep people safe. For example, traffic laws try to keep drivers and pedestrians safe. These laws tell drivers how to behave on the road.\nSome legal rules are based on social norms. Social norms are the unwritten rules that people in a group follow. These norms tell you how to behave properly in the group. For example, eating a meal together at a table with your family is a social norm.\nIf someone breaks a social norm, other people might think that the person is being rude. But social norms are not laws. Only the government can make laws.\nSOLUTION: Lon Fuller's objective in his hypothetical case of the Speluncean Explorers is to consider the extent to which murder requires mens rea. Murder is the killing of another person. Mens rea is the intent to kill. So, to consider the extent to which murder requires mens rea is to consider how responsible the killer has to be for the killing."}

In the United States, for example, the pursuit of justice has been used to justify the deportation of immigrants and the police brutality against people of color. Similarly, the idea of neutrality has been used to justify a lack of action in the face of injustice.

This tendency to project our own feelings onto others may be a fundamental aspect of being human.\nSome social scientists argue that anthropomorphic projection can help to explain the success of animals with human-like traits, such as dogs and cats. These animals are often kept as pets because people erroneously believe that they have emotions similar to our own.\nSOLUTION: Tom Regan's position on animals rights is based on sentimental anthropomorphicism. He believes that animals have inherent worth, which entitles them to the absolute right to live their lives with respect and autonomy.\nThis sentimental anthropomorphicism is Regan's answer to the question of what grants rights to animals. He believes that animals have inherent worth, which grants them rights."}

In this situation, what kind of society would you want to live in?\nRobert Nozick | An unjust society is one in which any person is compelled to do some action. Many things are compelled by the state. For example, you are compelled to pay taxes. You are compelled to follow the laws. But you are not compelled to be a good person. So, a society in which some people are compelled to do things for others is unjust.\nKarl Marx | The capitalist system is unjust.

Hohfeld identified four basic jural relations:\nA. Right. A right is a claim by a person who has a duty to perform a certain action, or who is entitled to receive a certain benefit.\nD. Liability. A liability is a duty imposed on a person to perform a certain action or to provide a certain benefit.\nP. Power. A power is the ability to do something without a duty to do it.\nI. Immunity. An immunity is the freedom from duty or liability.\nFor example, a right to free speech is a claim to express oneself without being restrained by others. A liability to incur debt is a duty to repay a loan. An immunity from taxation is a freedom from duty to pay taxes. A power to enforce a contract is the ability to ensure that the other party fulfills the contract.\nSOLUTION: The apparent correlatives privilege and no-right contradict Hohfeld's scheme.\nPrivilege and no-right are not included in Hohfeld's scheme. To have a privilege is to have a power that other people do not have. To have no-right is to not have a right that other people do have."}

Feminists believe that women have been treated unfairly in some ways, and that they should be allowed to do things that men are allowed to do. Feminists also want to live in a world in which power is not just in the hands of men.\nThere have always been at least two kinds of feminists. Liberal feminists and radical feminists.\nLiberal feminists believe that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men. They may also believe that women and men have different qualities, but that these differences do not affect how women are treated.\nRadical feminists believe that women are fundamentally different from men. They may believe that men have used their power to make women subservient. Therefore, radical feminists want to change the way society is organized."}

They assume that law is made by humans, and thus, the decisions of judges and politicians are inevitably influenced by their own interests and the interests of other powerful groups. As a result, realists reject the formalist idea that judges apply legal principles to reach impartial decisions.\nAccording to realists, judicial decisions are not purely based on legal principles. Instead, decisions are affected by the judges' personal and political views, as well as by the views of the powerful. For example, judges may decide cases in ways that favor large corporations over individuals, or they may decide cases in ways that reflect their own political views.\nSOLUTION: American realists argued that formalism devalued the authority of the judge to make law, because judicial decisions are less important than legislation. Legislation is made by politicians who are directly accountable to the people. Judges, in contrast, are not directly accountable to the people. Therefore, according to realists, it is more important for the people to influence the making of legislation than the making of judicial decisions."}

Some of these laws were valid, in the sense that they were enacted in accordance with the rules of the Nazi legal system. But they are not valid laws by today's standards.\nIn 1940, a German court concluded that Jews were not \"Aryan\" and therefore could not be German citizens. This law was valid according to the Nazi rule of recognition. But today we would consider it an invalid law, because it fails to meet the minimum standards of the modern international community."}
{"question": "Which of the following is the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Utilitarianism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Communitarianism."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cognitivism."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Positivism."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Ethical relativism is the idea that ethical judgments are not universal but depend on a culture or society.\nEthical relativism has two main branches:\nCultural relativism, which argues that ethical judgments are specific to each culture.\nSocial constructionism, which argues that ethical standards are a product of human agreement and can change over time.\nBoth branches of ethical relativism have been criticized for their implications concerning human rights. For example, if ethical standards are specific to each culture, then it becomes difficult to argue that the practices of one culture are worse than the practices of another culture. Similarly, if ethical standards are a product of human agreement, then it becomes difficult to argue that any practices are inherently wrong.\nHowever, some ethical theories provide a basis for objecting to ethical relativism's hostility to human rights.\nUtilitarianism takes the perspective that actions are moral if they promote overall happiness and immoral if they cause overall unhappiness. According to utilitarianism, human rights are moral standards because they promote overall happiness. For example, the right to freedom promotes overall happiness by allowing people to pursue their own happiness.\nCommunitarianism takes the perspective that ethical judgments need to be made with attention to the community. According to communitarianism, human rights are moral standards because they protect the community and individual alike. For example, the right to freedom protects the community by allowing individuals to contribute to the community.\nCognitivism takes the perspective that ethical judgments can be arrived at through reason and do not depend on culture or society. According to cognitivism, human rights are moral standards because they are based on reasoning about what is good for humans. For example, the right to freedom is a moral standard based on the reasoning that people have the ability to make choices about their own lives.\nPositivism takes the perspective that ethical standards are based on social norms. According to positivism, human rights are moral standards because they are based on shared norms. For example, the right to freedom is a moral standard based on the norm that people should not be imprisoned without cause."}

These parts include the police, the court system, and the corrections system.\nThe police are responsible for investigating crimes and bringing suspects to trial.\nThe court system is responsible for deciding whether a crime has been committed and whether the suspect is guilty of the crime.\nThe corrections system is responsible for managing and supervising offenders who have been found guilty.\nOne of the roles of the corrections system is to ensure that offenders serve their sentences in a safe and humane environment. The corrections system also works to help offenders turn their lives around and avoid repeating their criminal behavior.\nSOLUTION: To determine the appropriate punishment for an offender, courts may consider several factors. These factors include the severity of the crime, the offender's age and prior criminal record, and the offender's level of responsibility for the crime.\nNozick's formula focuses on the offender's level of responsibility and the harm caused by the crime. The formula requires courts to multiply the extent of the offender's responsibility for the crime by the actual harm caused by the crime.\nFor example, if an offender caused severe harm to others during a crime, the offender's level of responsibility for the crime would be high. So, the appropriate punishment would be a high number multiplied by a high number."}

According to this idea, people give up some of their natural freedom to a government that has the power to govern them. In return, the government is supposed to protect its citizens' natural rights and to promote the common good.\nThe social contract theory has two main proponents:\nThomas Hobbes, who says that people in the state of nature are driven by selfishness and are unable to trust one another. To escape this dangerous and chaotic situation, people give up some of their freedom to a central authority, called a sovereign, who will protect them. Hobbes argues that the sovereign is called the sovereign because he has the final authority to make decisions for the group.\nJohn Locke, who says that people in the state of nature are free and equal. To protect this freedom and equality, people form a social contract and give the sovereign power to govern them. Locke argues that the sovereign is called the sovereign because he has the final authority to make decisions for the group.\nOther political philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, have their own views on the social contract.\nSOLUTION: Thomas Hobbes says that the social contract is not a historical fact but a hypothetical construction of reason. Hobbes believes that the social contract theory is a way of explaining how government gains its power. According to Hobbes, people are motivated by self-interest and are willing to give up some of their freedom to a sovereign in order to avoid the chaos of the state of nature."}

A rule is a statement of what the law requires.\nRules have four elements. To be a valid rule, a statement of the law must have all four elements:\nAuthority: The rule is backed by an authority. This authority can be a constitution, a legislature, or a high court. For example, the rule that speeds on certain roads are limited to 65 miles per hour is backed by the authority of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nUniversality: The rule applies to all people in a particular situation. For example, the rule that you must be at least 21 years old to buy alcohol applies to all people in the United States.\nObligation: The rule requires you to do or not to do something. For example, the rule that you must file a tax return in April requires you to not to do something.\nSanction: The rule tells you what will happen if you do not follow the rule.

His work resolved many of the questions raised by previous philosophers, including the nature of space, time, and causation. But Kant is perhaps best known for his moral philosophy.\nKant believed that the most basic fact about the world is that people experience it in a particular way. We experience the world as a complex place, with objects, other people, and events that we can affect and that can affect us. From a young age, we learn to navigate this complex world. We do this by using our practical wisdom, or common sense, to understand what we should do in different situations.\nKant claimed that our practical wisdom tells us that we should always act in ways that could be universal laws. A universal law is a principle that could apply to everyone. For example, the law of gravity is a universal law. It applies to everyone, regardless of their particular situation.\nKant's categorical imperative is his version of the principle that should guide how we make moral decisions. According to Kant, to decide if an action is morally permissible, we must imagine that everyone does this action. Then, we must ask if this situation could be universal. If the answer is yes, then the action is morally permissible. If the answer is no, then the action is not morally permissible.\nSOLUTION: You must treat human beings as means rather than ends is not universally applicable. It is not a principle that could apply to everyone. For example, imagine that you are starving, and the only way to survive is to eat a fellow prisoner. This action is not morally permissible. It does not follow the categorical imperative, which is to act as if your values apply to everyone.\nYou must not consciously harm another person is a principle that could apply to everyone. So, it follows the categorical imperative. This answer is therefore the correct answer."}

The reasonable person standard focuses on the defendant's behavior.\nA person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.\nA person with a mental disability must act as would a person with the same mental disability.\nThese statements are incorrect.

The comparison is made up of two parts: the game of chess and the social life of bees.\nThe first part, the game of chess, is compared to the social life of bees. A game of chess is a dispute or contest between two people. Like a game of chess, the social life of bees involves conflict and cooperation. Bees work together to care for their young and defend their hive, but competition for a mate can cause conflict.\nThe second part of the comparison is the social life of bees. Bees live in large groups called colonies. They have a strict social order. A bee's role in the colony depends on its caste. Like a game of chess, the social life of bees has different roles and rules.\nSOLUTION: The statement most accurately compares social life to the game of chess.

According to this theory, law is made up of two parts: law as a social relation and law as a system of norms. Law as a social relation refers to the way that individuals in a society relate to one another according to the law. Law as a system of norms refers to the rules that are part of the law.\nA naive empiricist is a legal positivist who believes that the law is entirely a human creation and that the law has no connection to morality or to any other non-legal matter.\nSOLUTION: Austin's account of law as a social relation is based on an anachronistic model of a legal system. This model is not based on any real legal system and is incompatible with the way that legal systems actually operate. According to this model, the legal system is made up of a single person, called the sovereign, and the sovereign's rules. This model ignores the fact that legal systems are made up of many different people and institutions."}
