Many organisms, including some plants and animals, can reproduce by cloning. Cloning is not the same as reproduction.\nWhen an organism reproduces, its offspring are unique. Offspring have their own genes, or hereditary material. Each organism's genes are different, or unique. These genes affect the organism's observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nAn organism that is cloned produces offspring that have the same genes as the parent organism. So, offspring produced by cloning have the same genes as the parent organism. These offspring are not unique.\nSOLUTION: Kass worries that cloned individuals will be seen as curiosities. This means that people may be interested in looking at cloned individuals, but that is not necessarily a good thing. Kass also worries that cloned individuals will be scrutinized in relation to the person they are clones of. This means that people may compare cloned individuals to the person they are clones of, which could be unfair to the cloned individuals."}

After all, once you are dead, you are not around to worry about whether death is bad. So, how can it be bad?\nOne philosopher to tackle this question is Leon Kass. Kass thinks that the problem is that death is bad for us. This might seem like an odd claim, as we are not around to experience death. But Kass believes that death is bad for us because it deprives us of some important goods. For example, we are deprived of the good of a fulfilling life, and the good of staying alive. According to Kass, these goods are central to our well-being. So, death is bad for us because it deprives us of these goods."}

In this view, the severity of the punishment should be equal to the severity of the offense.\nUtilitarian theory, or consequentialist theory, is based on the idea that punishment is justified when it serves a useful purpose. The useful purpose can be to deter others from committing the same offense, to protect society from the offender, or to express society's disapproval of the offender's actions.\nThe most extreme form of utilitarian theory is embodied in the idea that the punishment should be proportional to the harm that it is expected to prevent."}

Baier claims that any moral theory that provides clear guidance about what is right and wrong is either too strict or too permissive to be plausible.\nA theory is too strict if it forbids things that we think are not wrong, or if it requires things that we think are not right. For example, if a theory always says that leaving a party early is wrong, then the theory is too strict. If a theory always says that staying up late to finish a project is required, then the theory is too strict.\nA theory is too permissive if it tells you to do things that you believe are wrong, or if it says that you do not have to do things that you believe are right. For example, if a theory tells you to eat meat, even when you believe that not eating meat is better, then the theory is too permissive. If a theory tells you that you do not have to watch for pedestrians, even when you believe that watching for pedestrians is necessary, then the theory is too permissive.\nBaier does not think that a moral theory can be both too strict and too permissive at the same time. So, if a theory is too strict or too permissive, then it is not an adequate theory."}

When you are responding to a persuasive text, you need to determine what evidence is used to support a claim and how well that evidence supports the claim.\nThomson's argument is that a woman has an obligation to use her kidneys to save the life of a person who is about to die. This is an argument that rests on the idea that a person has a moral obligation to save the life of another person if doing so is within their control.\nThe argument is intended to show that a woman has a moral obligation to allow the violinist to use her kidneys. The argument does not show that the violinist has a right to use the kidneys. A right is an obligation for another person to do something. A person does not have a right to something unless other people have an obligation to provide it.\nWhether the violinist has a right to use the kidneys is a different question. One way to answer this question is to decide whether the violinist has a right to the kidneys. But that is not what Thomson's argument does.\nAnother way to answer this question is to decide if the violinist has a right to use the kidneys. The violinist has a right to use the kidneys if the kidneys are not being used by the woman. The kidneys are not being used by the woman because she is not using them to help the person who is about to die. So, the violinist has a right to use the kidneys."}

For example, infants and people with certain types of cognitive disabilities do not have the capacity to morally evaluate their own actions, and they are not considered to have moral standing.\nHowever, many nonhuman animals are capable of exhibiting behaviors that indicate a moral sense.

On West's account, women who engage in undesired sex because of actual or felt dependence on their partner may experience injury to their sense of autonomy because they have neglected to take whatever steps would lead to their self-sustenance. Self-sustenance is a necessary condition for autonomy.\nSOLUTION: In order to be autonomous, one must be self-sustaining. Autonomy requires that one's basic needs are taken care of by oneself, rather than by another person. Women who engage in undesired sex because of actual or felt dependence on their partner are not self-sustaining. They are dependent on their partner for basic needs.

Her argument contains an implicit comparison: prohibition is paternalistic in the same way that currently existing laws are paternalistic. To show that prohibition is paternalistic in an objectionable sense, Marneffek needs to show that prohibition is paternalistic in the same way that currently existing laws are paternalistic.\nPaternalism is an objectionable sense of the word when it involves treating adults as if they are children and disregarding their mature wishes. For example, smoking bans that are imposed by government officials treat adults as if they are children. These bans ignore the fact that some people want to patronize smoking establishments and that many smokers support businesses that allow smoking.\nIn Marneffek's view, drug prohibition is paternalistic in an objectionable sense for two reasons. First, it is done for the benefit of others, not the benefit of those who wish to produce/sell drugs. Second, the prohibition ignores the wishes of those who wish to produce/sell drugs."}

Deontological theories claim that an action is inherently right or wrong, regardless of its consequences.\nA deontological theory of ethics is based on the idea that some things are inherently right or wrong, regardless of the specific circumstances. For example, it is inherently wrong to promise not to do something and then do it. Or, it is inherently right to help someone in need.\nA deontological theory of ethics is also based on the idea that some actions are inherently wrong, regardless of whether anyone is harmed by them. For example, it is inherently wrong to tell a lie.\nSOLUTION: The passage argues that we should accept a prerogative on the part of mothers to end a pregnancy until the fetus is a person. From this, we can conclude that abortion is presumptively morally wrong but can become permissible in certain extreme cases.\nThis solution is consistent with the principle of respect for autonomy, which states that people have the right to make certain basic decisions about their own lives.

These actions are considered morally right or wrong regardless of their consequences.\nA consequentialist ethic, however, holds that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on its consequences. So, an action is morally right if its consequences are better than an action's consequences. An action is morally wrong if its consequences are worse than another action's consequences.\nA virtue ethic focuses on the character of the person performing the action. A virtue ethic holds that there are certain virtues\u2014such as honesty, courage, and generosity\u2014that a person should have.

They think that such a practice would be unethical because it would create a new type of human being who is genetically superior to others.\nOne reason why people think that genetic enhancement is wrong is that it would create new social inequalities. For example, parents might choose to genetically enhance their children in order to make them stronger, smarter, or more talented. This could create a new class of genetically enhanced people who have more opportunities in life than others.\nAnother reason why people think that genetic enhancement is wrong is that it would go against the idea of human equality. Some people believe that all humans should be equal, regardless of their genes. If some people are genetically enhanced, they might be considered genetically superior, and this could lead to discrimination against those who are not enhanced.\nA religious reason to oppose genetic enhancement is that it would be \"playing God.\" This argument suggests that humans should not try to improve upon or create other forms of life."}

The project will fail unless the individuals agree to make a \"collective agreement\" to cooperate. To get them to make this agreement, the individuals must communicate and make a deal. But communication and deals require cooperation, which is what the project is intended to promote! It looks like the individuals are caught in a dilemma: they have an incentive to cooperate, but cooperation requires that they first agree to cooperate.\nHardin claims that this dilemma shows that the costs of eliminating a collective action problem are not irrelevant to its solution. In other words, the problem is not just that individuals are not cooperating. The problem is that they need to agree to cooperate, and that agreement is not going to be easy to achieve.\nThe Confucian model:\nOther approaches reject Hardin's emphasis on coercion. The Confucian model, for example, affirms the autonomy of individuals apart from others. This means that individuals have a responsibility to care for themselves and for others. But they can fulfill this responsibility only if they have the ability to do so. So, the Confucian model holds that individuals have a responsibility to help promote a project that will benefit everyone.\nThe Confucian model does not necessarily lead to real social change, which involves changes of mind as well as action. Some individuals may still refuse to cooperate. But the Confucian model holds that these individuals can be respectfully persuaded to change their minds. And if they are persuaded, they will want to cooperate.\nThe Confucian model does not accept coercion. It holds that coercion is not a way to get individuals to cooperate. Instead, the Confucian model holds that individuals should want to cooperate."}

Rule utilitarianism, for example, believes that a rule is moral if it produces the greatest amount of overall happiness.\nAn act-based consequentialist theory evaluates the moral value of an action by looking at the overall outcome it produces.

Imagine that you are considering driving to work instead of walking. You know that this will produce more carbon dioxide, which will contribute to climate change. But you also know that you will enjoy the drive.\nYour desire to enjoy the drive does not change the fact that driving to work will contribute to climate change. In this way, the choice to drive is a choice to harm future generations. This is because some actions, like burning fossil fuels, can harm other people or the environment.\nSome ethical theories, such as deontology, have different answers to this problem. A deontologist might say that you have a duty to avoid harming the environment. In this case, the duty to avoid harming the environment outweighs the desire to drive.\nSOLUTION: Kamm claims that Sandel's moral distinction between treatment and enhancement assumes that there is no moral difference between treatment and enhancement.

Euthanasia is a controversial issue. In the United States, the majority of doctors and nurses believe that euthanasia is unethical. Many doctors believe that they should not help their patients die. However, a smaller number of doctors do perform euthanasia.\nVoluntary euthanasia is when a patient asks a doctor to end his or her life. In the United States, this is considered unethical and is illegal.\nPhysician-assisted suicide is when a doctor helps a patient kill himself or herself. In the United States, this is considered unethical and is illegal.\nPassive euthanasia is when a doctor does not do anything to keep a patient alive. For example, a doctor may not use certain treatments that could keep a patient with a terminal illness alive. Passive euthanasia is sometimes allowed in the United States.\nActive euthanasia is when a doctor does something to end a patient's life. This is when a doctor administers a drug to kill a patient. In the United States, this is considered unethical and is illegal.\nSOLUTION: Terri Schiavo was a woman who was on life support. She had a terminal illness. Her husband wanted the doctors to remove her from life support. Ms. Schiavo's family did not want her to die. This is a case of passive euthanasia. The doctors were not doing anything to keep Ms. Schiavo alive. They were also not doing anything to kill her. They were just allowing her to die."}

For example, a desire to harm others is a bad desire. A desire for money is not, in itself, a bad desire. But a desire for money can become a bad desire if it leads you to harm other people.\nSOLUTION: The scientist's desire for mastery is not, as Sandel argues, a bad desire. A desire for mastery can be a good desire. For example, a chef's desire for mastery of her craft can lead to delicious meals. But the desire for mastery can become a bad desire if it leads you to treat others poorly.\nFor example, consider a graphic designer who is motivated by a desire for mastery to create a design that is so complex that it is impossible to use. The designer's desire for mastery has led her to treat her clients poorly. A desire for mastery can also become a bad desire if it leads you to focus too much on yourself. For example, a driver's desire for mastery of a racing game can lead to dangerous driving."}

Hate speech is different from other types of speech, such as debate or political speech, because it creates a hostile environment.\nA hostile environment is created when speech is severe or pervasive enough to alter the conditions of education or employment. The specific words used in the speech are important, but the context and circumstances in which the speech occurs are also important.\nIf a teacher continues to use a student's race as an insult during class, it creates a hostile environment. This is true even if the teacher does not use the student's name.\nIf a boss tells a joke that is about a protected class of people, it may create a hostile environment.\nNot all insults or slurs are hate speech. Whether or not speech is hate speech depends on the entire situation, including the speaker's intent and the audience's response.\nSOLUTION: Richardson-Self argues that sexist speech is always hate speech, because it involves violence.\nSexist speech is a form of hate speech.

They are based on different ideas about what the most important features of ethical questions are.\nA virtue ethics is a version of moral theory that focuses on the moral virtues and vices of a person. A virtue is a trait that helps a person live a good life. Living a good life is different from simply living a life that is fun or easy. For example, being honest is a virtue. Honesty is a trait that helps a person live a good life.\nA deontological ethics is a version of moral theory that focuses on the moral rules and duties of a person. Deontology comes from the Greek word deontologia, which means \"the study of duty.\" A deontological ethics is based on the idea that there are certain rules that are binding on all people, simply because they are rules. For example, the rule \"do not kill\" is a duty.\nA consequentialist ethics is a version of moral theory that focuses on the moral consequences of a person's actions. The most important feature of an action is how it affects the future. The effect of an action is a consequence. For example, the consequence of an action is how it affects the sum total of good and bad things that happen.\nA rights-based ethics is a version of moral theory that focuses on the rights of a person. A right is an essential license to do or receive something. For example, the right to free speech is a license to express yourself without censorship.\nUtilitarianism is a type of consequentialist ethics. It is a version of moral theory that focuses on the happiness and misery of a person. Happiness and misery are consequences. For example, the utility of an action is how happy it makes people.\nSOLUTION: Aristotle's moral theory is a version of virtue ethics. To be sure, Aristotle talks about some actions that are right or wrong. But he focuses mainly on the moral virtues and vices of a person. A person has virtues or vices when they do or fail to do what is right. For example, generosity is a virtue. Being generous is doing what is right."}

An intimate or expressive association is an organization that forms around shared intimate or expressive interests. For example, a political campaign is an intimate association. Members of a political campaign work together because they share a common goal.\nAn organization that is primarily a source of authority is different. A state is different from a political campaign. A state has the authority to make rules that affect its members. Members of a state have an obligation to follow the rules."}

He believes that nonhuman creatures have a moral claim to exist, and that humans have a duty to preserve those parts of the biotic community that are uneconomic.\nA conservation system based wholly on economic motives assumes that the economic parts of the biotic system will function without the uneconomic parts.\nThis is a mistaken assumption. The economic and the uneconomic parts of an ecosystem are interdependent.\nThe economic parts of an ecosystem, such as the animal or plant species that are in demand, perform essential functions. These functions, such as controlling pest populations, help to maintain the overall health of the ecosystem. The uneconomic parts of an ecosystem, such as the rare plant or animal species, also perform essential functions. These functions, such as pollinating plants or controlling disease, help to maintain the overall health of the ecosystem.\nA conservation system based wholly on economic motives ignores the moral claim that nonhuman creatures have a right to exist.\nA conservation system based wholly on economic motives assumes that economic motives are morally relevant. This assumption is not necessarily true.\nMoral relevancy is not the same as economic value. An organism's economic value is a measure of its usefulness to humans. An organism's moral relevancy is a measure of how it affects the basic structure of the world.\nA conservation system based on the moral relevancy of nonhuman creatures is more complete than one based on economic motives alone.\nA conservation system that takes into account the moral claim that nonhuman creatures have a right to exist is more likely to preserve the biotic community as a whole."}

They have fewer resources to cope with the effects of climate change, such as more frequent and severe natural disasters and changes in temperature and rainfall patterns.\nAnother way is through the unequal terms of trade. Developed countries have a demand for goods and services from developing countries. This demand allows developing countries to raise revenues and reduce their dependence on aid. However, the prices that developing countries receive for their goods and services are often unfairly low. This low price is a major reason why many developing countries remain poor.\nA third way is through the perpetuation of stereotypes.

For example, many people think that sunsets have intrinsic value. The value of a sunset is not based on what it does or what you can do with it. It has value simply because a sunset exists.\nExtrinsic value is the value that something has, based on its relationship to other things. For example, a sunset has extrinsic value as a source of warmth and light. The value of a sunset is based on what it does or what you can do with it.\nThe doctrine of double effect says that an action that has both an intrinsic value and an extrinsic value can be morally permissible. For an action to be morally permissible, the following conditions must be met:\nThe intrinsic value of the action must not be bad.\nThe extrinsic value of the action must not be gained by doing something that is bad.\nThe following illustration shows how these conditions apply to an action that has both intrinsic and extrinsic value:\nA father helps his sick child by giving him a painful medication. The medication has an intrinsic value because it helps his child get better. The father helps his child by giving him the medication. So, the action has an extrinsic value.\nThe intrinsic value of the medication is not bad. It is not bad for the child to feel better.\nThe extrinsic value of the medication is not gained by doing something that is bad. The father does not do something bad, like enjoy seeing his child suffer.\nSo, the father's action is morally permissible.\nSOLUTION: To say that an action is intrinsically permissible is to say that the action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible. This means that the action has an intrinsic value that is not bad.\nNo actual person would ever endorse that action means that there is no one who wants the action to be done. But, an action does not have to be endorsed by anyone to be intrinsically permissible.\nThe action is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable means that the action has an extrinsic value. But, the extrinsic value of the action is not gained by doing something that is bad.\nThe following action is intrinsically permissible. It is not bad for someone to get a piece of paper out of a filing cabinet.\nThe following action is intrinsically impermissible. It is bad for someone to hit another person."}

One way it does this is by banning activities that are found to be harmful. If an activity is found to be directly harmful to some individuals, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to other individuals or society as a whole, then the state may ban the activity.\nHowever, if an activity is not directly harmful to any individual, but is simply found to be socially harmful, such as prostitution, it is not a violation of individual rights for the state to prohibit it. In this case, the harm is to society as a whole, not to individual prostitutes or their customers.\nThe term harm is used in two different ways in this discussion.\nAn activity is directly harmful to an individual if it involves a significant risk of physical harm to the individual.\nAn activity is socially harmful if it is harmful to society as a whole, or to some group within society.\nSOLUTION: According to Michael Huemer, the harm of drug use to individual drug users does not justify state prohibition of drug use. To begin with, the harm of drug use is not always directly harmful to the drug user. It is sometimes harmful to others, but not to the drug user herself. For example, the use of drugs by a pregnant woman may harm her unborn child, but does not harm the woman herself.\nMoreover, the harm of drug use is not great enough to justify state prohibition. Drinking alcohol is more harmful than using many drugs, yet the state allows people to drink alcohol. If the harm of drug use is not great enough to justify banning alcohol, then it is not great enough to justify banning other drugs."}

For example, a being with relative moral standing has value because it is important to a being with direct or indirect moral standing. A pet has relative moral standing.\nA being or group with no moral standing has no value.\nSOLUTION: Mary has direct moral standing.

When people have rights, they own the rights. Ownership gives people control over a part of the world. For example, if you own a car, you have the right to control how the car is used.\nBut people have rights to use natural resources, and that allows them to control how the resources are used. For example, if you have the right to cut wood in a forest, you can decide how much wood to cut and when to cut it.\nThe problem with having too many rights is that resources can be overused or destroyed. If resources are overused or destroyed, they may not be available for future generations to use.\nSOLUTION: Hardin believes that the overuse of resources is causing world hunger and poverty. When there are too many people using limited resources, the resources may not be fairly divided. Some people may not have enough food, water, or other important things they need."}

We can use the person's skills or resources to achieve our goals, but we must always treat the person as an end in themselves.\nThe second answer choice is incorrect.

Harmful punishment is proportionate to the harm done by the wrongdoing. In other words, the punishment should be equal in magnitude to the harm caused by the wrongdoing.\nFor example, if a person accidentally breaks a window, the harm done is equal to the cost of replacing the window. The punishment must be equal to this cost. If the cost of replacing the window is the same as the cost of fixing it, then the punishment must be equal to the cost of fixing the window.\nHowever, Metz does not believe that unfriendly action, degradation, or deterrence is justified.\nUnfriendly action is not proportionate to the harm done. For example, if a person is rude to someone in a store, the harm caused is unrelated to the unfriendliness. The harm is the cost of the stolen item.\nDegradation is also not proportionate to the harm done. For example, if a person is punished by being forced to do menial tasks, the punishment is not related to the harm caused. The punishment is itself degrading.\nDeterrence is also not justified. The harm caused by a wrongdoing is not directly related to the need for deterrence. For example, the harm caused by driving drunk is not related to the number of drinks a person has had."}

These are called arbitrary inequalities.\nArbitrary inequalities are those that can be removed without leading to any greater inequalities. For example, it is arbitrary to prohibit someone from riding in the front of a streetcar just because of their skin color.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether a certain inequality is proper, consider how the inequality affects the greatest equal liberty of the least advantaged person.\nThe principle of greatest equal liberty says that each person is to have an equal right to opportunities and resources that belong to that person but nobody else.\nThis means that the social and economic inequalities that are built into society are not acceptable. These inequalities include things like inherited wealth and unearned privilege.\nHowever, the principle of greatest equal liberty does not require that all people achieve the same outcomes. Instead, it requires that they have the same opportunities to pursue their own individual goals."}

His main concern was to find a way to live consistently as a moral being. He believed that to do this, one had to follow a rule that he called the categorical imperative. The categorical imperative is a way of deciding whether an action is right or wrong. It is a principle that is universal and unconditional, and that applies to all people.\nTo determine whether an action is right, according to the categorical imperative, consider the following:\nIf everyone did this, would the world be a worse place or a better place?\nIf the answer is that the world would be a worse place, then the action is not right.\nIf the answer is that the world would be a better place, then the action is right.\nSOLUTION: According to Kant, marriage allows spouses to treat each other not as mere means when engaging in sexual activity because the universal law formulation of the categorical imperative requires that each of us be married.\nWhen two people have sexual relations, each person is using the other for his or her own sexual pleasure. This means that each person is treating the other as a mere means to his or her own end. But if two people are married, they are not using each other as mere means. They are working together to create a permanent bond of love and commitment."}

For example, the norm requiring individuals to avoid stepping out of an airplane without a parachute is rarely discussed. But if an individual steps out of an airplane without a parachute, it is likely that other individuals in the group will consider this person to be behaving in an unsafe and unacceptable way.\nNorms can be enforced by rewards and penalties.

Individuals who violate the norms may be penalized with negative feedback from others.\nSOLUTION: The passage argues that the norms governing the moral permission of abortion are a complex matter of the mother's personal integrity and her ideals about motherhood and creation. This is a personal matter. It is not simply a matter of the mother's preferences, and it is not impersonal and categorical."}

Leopold wrote, \"The tragedy of the commons happens when people use resources as if they are infinite, even though they are not. This tends to happen when people can use resources without paying the full cost of using them. The result is that people use more resources than is sustainable.\"\nSOLUTION: Hardin argues that the tragedy of the commons happens when people use resources as if they are infinite, even though they are not. He writes, \"The problem is that the commons is an open access system. There are no barriers to entry, and anyone can use the common resource. This leads to a race to see who can use the most of the resource before it runs out. The tragedy of the commons happens when the resource is used up.\"\nHardin believes that the fundamental error of \"sharing ethics\" is that it assumes people will cooperate and voluntarily control their use of a resource. But open-access systems do not encourage people to cooperate. To the contrary, open-access systems encourage people to grab as much of the resource as they can before someone else takes it."}

Autonomy is the ability to make choices for oneself. Some people believe that it is more important to allow individuals to make their own choices, even if the choices are not the most happy ones, than it is to force individuals to follow a rule that will make them happy.\nRoss argues that utilitarianism ignores the personal character of duty. This means that utilitarianism does not take into account the fact that some actions are right or wrong, regardless of whether they lead to happiness. For example, utilitarianism would consider it right to lie to people if doing so would make more people happy. But some people believe that lying is wrong, even if it is more advantageous to be untruthful."}

This means that animals have a right to live and that we cannot kill or harm them for trivial reasons.\nSome animals have a capacity for suffering, which means that they can suffer from harm. The fact that an animal can suffer from harm means that it has an interest in not being harmed. This interest in not being harmed is part of the animal's direct moral standing.\nThe bad qualities of character that our actions evince refer to the consequences of our actions.

When we value a patient's autonomy in this way, what, according to Velleman, do we value?\nTo have effective options is to have options that are genuinely available. A patient's effective options are not necessarily the same as the patient's opportunities. Some opportunities may not be realistic, and therefore not available, for patients with certain conditions. For example, a patient with severe heart disease may not have the opportunity to run a marathon. But with treatment, the patient may have the opportunity to walk a few blocks. The treatment has made the opportunity available.\nTo have capacity for self-determination is to have the ability to make informed decisions. A patient with the capacity for self-determination has the ability to decide what is best for herself. This capacity is not the same as effective options. A patient may have many options, but if the patient is unable to understand the options or the consequences of each option, the patient does not have the capacity for self-determination.\nTo provide the patient with options is to give the patient a range of choices. This can be done by offering different treatments or by presenting information in a way that allows the patient to make different choices.\nTo share reasons with the patient is to give the patient information about the options. The information should include the benefits and risks of each option. This information can help the patient make a decision that is best for the patient.\nSOLUTION: Velleman values the patient's capacity for self-determination. To have capacity for self-determination is to have the ability to make informed decisions. A patient with the capacity for self-determination has the ability to decide what is best for herself.

When externalities are imposed on people who did not agree to the activities that caused them, these externalities are said to be imposed on the world's poor.\nSome externalities, such as pollution, are caused by the way people produce or use goods and services. This pollution can be carried by the wind or water to nearby communities, or it can affect people globally. The costs of pollution are imposed on the world's poor in several ways. For example, the poor often live in areas with severe pollution. Also, the poor may have to spend more of their income to buy food and water that is safe to eat and drink.\nOther externalities, such as crimes, are caused by the way people use goods and services. When one country produces goods and services that are sold in another country, the country that produces the goods and services may impose costs on the other country.

Care ethics is a reaction to the predominance of justice-based ethics, which has been the main type of normative ethics for the past two centuries. Care ethics is not anti-justice. Rather, it argues that the values of care and justice are both necessary for a complete ethical theory.\nCare ethics includes the following key claims:\n1. Care is a central moral value.\n2. Close, personal relationships are crucial for moral and psychological well-being.\n3. The ethics of care is concerned with duties and services that are required by these relationships.\n4. The ethics of care is directly applied to particular, concrete situations.\n5. The ethics of care is committed to the idea that the only criteria for judgment are the interests of those involved.\nA care-based approach to ethics turns traditional moral theory upside down. Traditional ethics begins with discussions of individual rights and justice. Care ethics begins with the idea that individuals have needs that others have reason to help meet.\nSOLUTION: Read the underlined text carefully.\nAccording to Collins, one key claim of care ethics is that deliberation should include sympathy and direct attendance to concrete particulars.\nThis claim has two parts. First, deliberation should include sympathy. This means that in order to make good decisions, we need to try to understand the perspectives and feelings of other people. Second, deliberation should include direct attendance to concrete particulars. This means that in order to make good decisions, we need to pay attention to the details of the specific situation."}

Liberal egalitarianism is a form of egalitarianism that is committed to individual rights, and it holds that social positions should be open to all individuals and that individuals should be evaluated on the basis of their abilities and characteristics rather than their social status.\nLiberal egalitarianism has two main components: equal protection of the law and equal opportunities. The principle of equal protection of the law requires that laws and official policies be applied equally to all individuals. The principle of equal opportunities requires that individuals be given equal opportunities to get what they want.\nLiberal egalitarianism does not mandate specific outcomes, but rather requires that social institutions and markets be open to all and that individuals be evaluated on the basis of their abilities and characteristics rather than their social status.\nSOLUTION: Caren argues that liberal egalitarianism does not address the question of whether a black doctor has a moral obligation to practice in a black community. This is because the only limit that liberal egalitarianism places on individuals' moral obligations, according to Caren, is that they must be in accord with liberal egalitarianism itself."}

For example, in the theory of utilitarianism, the ethical dilemma of maximizing overall happiness leads to the principle that actions should be chosen to maximize the total amount of happiness in a social group.\nCare ethics begins with an ethical dilemma that arises from the role of caretaker. Caretaking involves attending to the needs of others in a way that is responsive and attentive to their individual needs. The ethical dilemma is that caring for others is a major part of human life, but it is not clear that caring for others is a demand of morality.\nCollins answers the objection to care ethics by arguing that caring attitudes are not moral attitudes at all. This means that we are not morally required to have caring attitudes. Instead, caring attitudes are a result of the ethical dilemma of caretaking. To have caring attitudes is to be a caretaker."}

The two main components of any consequentialist theory are the punishment principle and the harm principle.\nThe punishment principle states that a lawbreaker should be punished only if punishment would likely produce as much overall intrinsic value as would any other alternative punishment. Intrinsic value is a measure of how much value or benefit a particular action or outcome has in and of itself. For example, saving a life has a lot of intrinsic value.\nThe harm principle states that a lawbreaker should be punished only if punishment is necessary to prevent harm to others. This harm can include the immediate consequences of the lawbreaker's actions, as well as the long-term consequences of setting a precedent for other potential lawbreakers.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether a lawbreaker should be punished, consider the punishment principle and the harm principle.\nAccording to the punishment principle, the punishment should produce as much overall intrinsic value as any other alternative punishment. This means that the punishment should be effective in deterring the lawbreaker and others from similar wrongdoing.\nThe punishment must be proportional to the wrongdoing. The punishment for a minor crime should be less severe than the punishment for a major crime.\nThe punishment must be consistent with treating the person as an end in themselves. Punishments that are excessively harsh or that involve grossly disproportionate punishments for specific crimes violate the principle of respect for the person."}

This is not a good idea for many reasons.\nFirst, it is not a drug user's fault that he or she has a drug problem. A disease called addiction causes many people to keep using a drug. Addiction is not their fault.\nSecond, taking drugs is not a crime that should be punished by going to war! Criminals, yes.

When one person's actions cause the death of another person, the first person is said to have killed the other person.\nKilling is different from letting die. When one person allows another person to die, he is said to have let the other person die.\nMany people think that killing is always wrong, but letting die is not. Whether or not letting die is wrong depends on the situation.\nSome situations involving letting die are:\nA person with a terminal illness who is in a great deal of pain may choose to let herself die.\nA person who is on vacation in the wilderness may let a terminally ill dog die.\nThese situations may not be ideal, but they are not wrong.\nOther situations involving letting die are:\nA person who is able to afford medical treatment for a sick family member, but chooses not to seek treatment, may let the family member die.\nA person who is responsible for the care of an elderly parent, but decides not to pay for a necessary operation, may let the parent die.\nBoth of these situations are wrong. The person has the ability to prevent the death, and failing to do so leads to the other person's death. In these situations, the person has let the other person die.\nSOLUTION: The last three answers describe actions that could kill people in Third World countries. These actions would clearly be wrong.\nDepriving people of medicine they need to survive, poisoning their food, and refusing to give them money they need to purchase food are all ways in which one person can kill another person.\nWithholding knowledge that they need to produce food is a form of letting them die. This answer is not as bad as the other answers, but it is still wrong. People in Third World countries need knowledge to produce food. Withholding this knowledge keeps them from being able to grow their own food."}

For example, crying out \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater is causal harm. The speech damages people by causing them to run into danger.\nExpressive harm is when someone's speech expressly, or on purpose, causes harm to others' feelings or emotions. For example, calling someone a \"racist\" is expressive harm. The speech damages someone's feelings or emotions.\nAuxilary harm is when the harm is not the main reason for the speech.

{"question": " According to Kant, an imperative that represents an action as a necessary means to something that is willed is what kind of imperative?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "categorical"}, {"label": "B", "text": "universalizable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hypothetical"}, {"label": "D", "text": "noumenal"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: An imperative that tells you that an action is a necessary means to some end is a hypothetical imperative. For example, the imperative \"Save your money if you want to buy a house\" is a hypothetical imperative. If you follow this imperative, it will lead to the end of owning a house. But if you don't save your money, you won't be able to buy a house.\nA categorical imperative is an imperative that represents an action as being necessary in itself, independent of any other considerations. A categorical imperative is different from a hypothetical imperative because it is not conditional on any other goals. For example, the categorical imperative \"Never lie\" is an imperative that represents telling the truth as being necessary in itself.\nA universalizable imperative is an imperative that you can apply to everyone without contradiction. For example, the universalizable imperative \"Help others when you can\" is an imperative that you can apply to everyone without contradiction. But the imperative \"Steal from the rich to give to the poor\" is not universalizable without contradiction, because it tells you to do something that is wrong.\nA noumenal imperative is an imperative that represents an action as being necessary because of the way the world is. But the way the world is is hard to know directly. Instead, we have to rely on our ideas and concepts to understand the world. So, a noumenal imperative is an imperative that represents an action as being necessary because of the way the world is, based on our ideas and concepts. This is different from a categorical imperative, which is necessary in itself, and a hypothetical imperative, which is necessary for some end. For example, the noumenal imperative \"Stay alive\" is an imperative that represents an action as being necessary because of the way the world is.\nSOLUTION: To determine whether an imperative represents an action as a necessary means to something that is willed, look for an if-then statement. An if-then statement represents an action as a necessary means to some end.\nThe imperative \"Protect the rare bird species or face fines and jail time\" is an imperative that represents an action as a necessary means to avoid fines and jail time. But it does not represent the action as a necessary means to preserve a rare bird species.\nSo, the imperative represents an action as a necessary means to something that is willed. It is a hypothetical imperative."}

From a utilitarian perspective, the right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people.\nIf an action is not wrong in and of itself, then it is a right. A right is a moral claim that other people have to do something or to not do something. For example, the right to life is a moral claim that other people have not to kill you.\nIf an action is wrong in and of itself, then it is a duty. A duty is a moral claim that you have to do something. For example, the duty to help someone in need is a moral claim that you have to help that person.\nSome deontological theories include the idea that there are duties to avoid harming others. Lying, stealing, and assault are all wrong because they involve harming others. A person has a duty not to lie, not to steal, and not to assault.\nOther deontological theories include the idea that there are rights to goods and services.

They may base these predictions on their own intuitions, on the advice of others, or on patterns they have observed. Fortune-telling can be harmful because it can cause people to overlook important information and to jump to false conclusions.\nBlaming is the practice of holding someone responsible for a problem. People who engage in blaming may use language that suggests that a person is the problem. For example, they may say that a person is \"lazy,\" \"stupid,\" or \"a failure.\" Blaming can be harmful because it can make people feel bad and can make it less likely that they will try to change their behavior.\nDichotomous thinking is the practice of reducing complex issues to simple, black-and-white choices.

The Geneva Conventions, a set of international laws that govern the rules of war, require that parties to a conflict abide by certain rules intended to protect people who are not participating in the hostilities, including civilians and prisoners.\nSome civilians, for example, are excluded from the protections of the Geneva Conventions. These people, known as combatants, take a direct part in hostilities. They may be members of an armed force, or they may be \"irregular\" fighters who do not meet the criteria to be considered soldiers under the conventions.\nIf civilians take a direct part in hostilities, they lose their protection as civilians and become combatants. For example, this could happen if a civilian picks up a gun and joins in a firefight.\nCombatants do not have the protection of the Geneva Conventions. They may be tortured, executed, or treated in other inhumane ways.\nThe conventions also do not apply to prisoners who are members of organized armed groups that do not wear a recognizable insignia. This means that members of these groups do not have to follow the rules for wearing uniforms and are not protected by the conventions.\nThe line between combatant and noncombatant can sometimes be blurry. For example, a person who is both a civilian and a non-uniformed member of an armed group is not protected by the conventions.\nSOLUTION: Valls suggests that there is a categorical and clear difference between combatants and noncombatants. Civilians, soldiers, and irregular fighters are each clearly defined.\nThe other answer choices are not consistent with Valls's argument."}

Critical thinking skills allow individuals to process information, consider solutions, and make reasoned decisions.\nCritical thinking involves questioning, analyzing, and synthesizing information to reach a thoughtful judgment.\nIt is important to recognize that emotions can influence how we think. Emotional reasoning is the process of assuming that your feelings must be true. For example, if you are feeling anxious, you might assume that you are in danger. However, your feelings do not always match the reality of the situation.\nSOLUTION: Lukianoff and Haidt argue that American colleges and universities now encourage emotional reasoning, or the belief that your feelings are always a good guide to what is true or important. They suggest that this approach can discourage critical thinking."}

According to natural law theory, moral principles are based on the nature of things and the nature of human beings. All things, including humans, have a nature that determines what is appropriate for them. For humans, human nature determines what is moral.\nHuman nature, according to Aquinas, includes the capacity to reason and the tendency to behave in certain ways. Human reason allows people to determine the moral principles that apply to them. This ability means that people have a duty to follow the moral law.\nAquinas believed that the moral law is based on the nature of things. This means that the moral law is unchangeable. It is not made by any society or culture. The moral law is known through reason, not through revelation.\nSOLUTION: To determine if Aquinas's moral theory is a version of consequentialism, consider how he understood the moral principles.\nConsequentialism is the view that the moral value of an action is determined by its consequences.\nAquinas believed that the moral value of an action is determined by its nature. An action is moral if it is in accord with the natural law. The natural law is determined by the nature of things and the nature of human beings.\nSo, Aquinas's moral theory is not a version of consequentialism.\nAquinas's moral theory is a version of natural law theory. It is based on the nature of things and the nature of human beings. This includes the nature of human beings as beings who have the capacity to reason.\nAquinas's moral theory is not a version of rights-based theory. Rights-based theory holds that people have rights and that the purpose of society is to protect these rights. Aquinas believed that human beings have both rights and duties. But he thought that the purpose of society is to help people live in accord with the natural law.\nAquinas's moral theory is not a version of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics is the view that people should strive to live a good life and to embody virtues. Aquinas believed that people should strive to live a good life. But he thought that the moral principles that apply to everyone are based on the nature of things and the nature of human beings, not on virtue."}

In other words, she believes that even though justice has miscarriages of justice, the moral benefits of doing justice still make it the best choice."}

They aim to prove that a certain practice does more harm than good.\nA harm argument has two parts: the claim that a certain practice is harmful, and the claim that a certain amount of harm is too much.\nThe first claim can be supported by research, expert opinions, or both. For example, we know that smoking is harmful because it has been shown in research that smoking increases the risk of cancer and other diseases.\nThe second claim is a value judgment. Different people and groups may have different views on how much harm is too much. For example, some people think that any amount of harm is too much, while others think that an acceptable amount of harm is less than the harm that occurs.\nThese value judgments show that there may be a hidden assumption in a harm argument. The hidden assumption is that the harms identified are the harms that are most important to consider.\nSOLUTION: Corvino takes Harm Argument #3 to be problematic:\nIf a practice is riskier than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided.\nThis argument assumes that the harms that are associated with a practice are the harms that are most important to consider. It also assumes that the harms that are associated with a practice are worse than the harms that are associated with the alternatives."}
