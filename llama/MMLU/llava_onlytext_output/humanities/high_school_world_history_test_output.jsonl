{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E."}, {"label": "D", "text": "How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Different societies have developed in different ways. These ways of life are called cultural systems. A culture is a way of life that is shared by a group of people. Cultural systems include the values, customs, and beliefs that are passed down through families and communities.\nThere are many different cultural systems, and they can be sorted into three basic groups: nomadic, agrarian, and industrial.\nNomadic cultures are based on livestock herding. Nomadic people move their animals to different places to find food. In ancient times, many nomadic people were traders. They exchanged animal products, such as meat, milk, and wool, for other goods.\nAgrarian cultures are based on agriculture. Agrarian people cultivate crops and raise animals. They tend the soil and plants to produce food.\nIndustrial cultures are based on industry. Industrial people create manufactured goods. They use tools and machines to produce goods on a large scale.\nSOLUTION: The passage explains why gunpowder weaponry developed in different ways in Europe and Asia. The reason was that people in different parts of the world faced different threats.\nEuropean states faced threats from other states. So, they developed gunpowder weapons to help defend themselves.\nBut Asian states did not face threats from other states. Instead, they were threatened by horse archer nomads. So, they devoted their efforts to improving their horse archer units.\nThis difference in the types of military threats led to a difference in the way gunpowder weaponry developed in Europe and Asia."}

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road.

And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

The campaign was part of a broader effort to modernize China's agricultural sector and to increase agricultural production.\nThe goal of this transformation was to create large, efficient agricultural enterprises that could provide the food needed to feed China's growing population. By collectivizing agriculture, Mao's government hoped to increase agricultural output, to make it possible to feed China's people. At the same time, the transformation was intended to decrease inequality in the countryside, to increase socialist consciousness among the peasants, and to make it possible to develop a socialist economy in the countryside.\nThe socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture, step by step, Mao wrote, means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.\nSOLUTION: Mao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" in China involved the collectivization of agriculture, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.\nThis transformation was intended to increase agricultural efficiency, which would allow the state to invest more heavily in modernizing agricultural production, as agricultural surpluses allowed the state to do so. The increased agricultural production would then raise the standard of living across the whole of China, as agricultural efficiency reduced prices of basic commodities.\nAs agriculture fueled industrialization in cities as excess labor flowed from the countryside to urban centers, the standard of living across the whole of China continued to rise."}

But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Killing of civilians during wartime"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Violence can be perpetrated by individuals, groups, or states. It can be perpetrated by people of any age, gender, or culture.\nViolence is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. Some of the factors that can contribute to violence include:\nPoverty and social inequality: When people are poor and socially disadvantaged, they may be more likely to use violence to get what they want. This is because their choices are often limited by their circumstances. They may have fewer options for achieving their goals, and they may engage in violence if they believe it will help them succeed.\nHarmful behavior and attitudes: When people are exposed to violence in their lives, they may learn to use violence as a way to solve problems. This can create a cycle of violence in which violence is passed from person to person.\nAccess to weapons: When people have easy access to weapons, they are more likely to use violence. Weapons make it easier to cause harm, and they can make violence deadlier.\nConflict and war: When nations or groups are in conflict, they may use violence to achieve their goals. This can happen on a small scale (e.g., assassination) or on a large scale (e.g., war).\nViolence can have many causes, and it can have many forms."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAlthough in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive\u2014and if necessary flog\u2014the backward nation forward.\n\u2014Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great: His Life and World\nBased on the above passage, what kinds of reforms did Peter the Great embrace?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Creation of an elected assembly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Declarations of human rights"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Development of a constitutional monarchy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reduction of aristocratic influence"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Many powerful leaders have tried to impose reforms from the top down. They assume that they know better than the people who live the daily life of a country. But the record of such attempts is mixed, at best.\nReforms imposed by a powerful leader may be beneficial in the short run, but they can also lead to long-term problems. When leaders do not listen to the people who are affected by the reforms, they may not be aware of unintended consequences. As a result, the reforms may not achieve their intended goals. Or, they may have unintended and harmful consequences.\nMore than 200 years ago, Catherine the Great tried to impose reforms on Russia. But the reforms did not take into account the day-to-day concerns of the Russian people. As a result, the reforms had the opposite effect. They led to instability and unrest.\nThis shows that reforms need to be sensitive to the daily concerns of the people who are affected by them. Lawmakers need to hear from their constituents. And leaders need to be responsive to the needs of their people.\nSOLUTION: The passage tells you that Peter the Great was determined to change Russia. He was determined to be the driving force in this change. This means that Peter the Great embraced the development of a constitutional monarchy.\nA constitutional monarchy is a form of government in which a monarch serves as the head of state. But the monarch's powers are limited by a constitution. This constitution may include a bill of rights. A bill of rights is a document that spells out the basic rights of the people.\nIn the late 1800s, many countries in Europe were changing from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy. An absolute monarchy is a form of government in which the monarch holds all the power."}

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them.

Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute.

For example, they often have a system of taxation, a central government, and laws that are enforced throughout the empire. Many classical empires also have grand architecture, such as palaces and temples.\nSOLUTION: To decide if a classical empire was similar to the Roman Empire in terms of its decline, look at the reasons why the Roman Empire fell. Those reasons are:\nThe victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\nOther empires that have similar patterns of decline include the Han, Tang, and Ottoman empires. These empires also have grand architecture, but they are corrupted from within.\nThe Aztec, Etruscan, and Ming empires do not have similar patterns of decline. The Aztec and Ming empires are conquered by outside forces, but they do not collapse from within. The Etruscan civilization is no longer a empire, but a state, when it falls.\nThe Qin empire is too early to be compared with the Roman Empire. The Qin empire is the first ancient Chinese empire, and it declines after its founder dies."}

This act was passed in 1882, and it was the first law to restrict immigration based on a person's country of origin. At the time, many Americans feared that an influx of Chinese immigrants would cause economic problems.\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act showed how debates over immigration can be influenced by economic conditions.

It also connected distant parts of the country, which opened up new lands for settlement.\nMany of the immigrants who came to America in the late 1800s were fleeing poverty or persecution in their home countries.

These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

In society, these expectations are called norms. Norms are a set of rules that specify what is acceptable behavior. Norms can be different for different groups.\nFor example, a norm for one group may be that each person should try to make money. This norm may not be a norm for another group. For example, a norm for a religious group may be to avoid spending money on luxury items.\nPeople and groups have different types of social positions, or statuses. Some common statuses are:\nA student.\nA parent.\nA teacher.\nA lawyer.\nA worker.\nA boss.\nSocial stratification is the way in which people are ranked and organized by their social positions.\nHow are people ranked and organized by their social positions? People are ranked and organized by their social positions based on the expectations of the society in which they live.\nFor example, people who are doctors are ranked higher in the social structure than people who are janitors. This is because the society values doctors more highly than janitors. Doctors save lives, and people have to wear gloves around doctors. Janitors do not require gloves.\nSocial classes are groups of social positions that have similar levels of wealth, power, and prestige. In some societies, social classes are named. In other societies, social classes do not have formal names.\nFor example, in the United States, the social class of the wealthy is one of the highest social classes. The wealthy have a high level of wealth, power, and prestige. They own many of the country's largest companies.\nThe social class of the working class is a lower social class. The working class is made up of people who have low levels of wealth, power, and prestige. Many people in the working class work in factories and offices.\nPeople's social classes can affect their lives in many ways. For example, people's social classes can affect the schools that they attend, the jobs that they can have, and the neighborhoods in which they live.\nSOLUTION: The passage suggests that corrupt elites are taking advantage of the native population. This is evidence of the absence of corruption among elites."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nSource 1:\n\"You may well ask: \"Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.

By the end of the 2000 s, the percentage of the world's population that was literate was over 80%.\nIn some countries, the government has helped to spread literacy.

The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, as it was based on the Hindu holy texts, and it transcended historical eras. By the time of the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131858), the caste system was a deeply entrenched part of Indian society. Muslim rulers, who governed India for more than 1,000 years, did not change the caste system.\nThe caste system reinforced Indian identity and provided a sense of social order. People's occupations were determined by their caste, and people were expected to follow the occupation of their caste. For example, a Brahmin's occupation was to be a priest or a teacher. A Kshatriya's occupation was to be a ruler or a warrior. A Vaisya's occupation was to be a merchant or a farmer. A Sudra's occupation was to be a servant or a laborer.\nThe caste system was also a factor in the exclusion of some people from the benefits of Indian society. For example, untouchables, or outcastes, were not allowed to attend school or to use many public facilities.\nSOLUTION: The passage above says that the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa.

Treaties have the full force of law. This means that the provisions of a treaty are as much a part of the United States legal system as any federal law passed by Congress.\nTreaties can cover a wide range of issues. Two treaties that are often discussed in school are the Treaty of Geneva and the North Atlantic Treaty.\nThe Treaty of Geneva is also known as the Geneva Conventions. It is a treaty that covers the rules for the conduct of war. The treaty is based on the principle that wounded soldiers and sailors, and other noncombatants, should be treated humanely. The treaty also covers the rules for the treatment of prisoners of war.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty is a treaty that was signed in 1949. The treaty is a collective defense agreement. This means that if one country is attacked, all of the other countries that are part of the treaty will help defend it. For example, if Afghanistan is attacked, the United States will help defend Afghanistan as part of its obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty.\nSOLUTION: The North Atlantic Treaty in the passage above most clearly supports the concept of collective defense. The treaty's purpose is to protect its member countries from attack. This is called collective defense.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty does not support the concept of mutually assured destruction. Mutually assured destruction is a concept in which both sides know that if either side attacks, the other side will retaliate with nuclear weapons. The North Atlantic Treaty does not require its member countries to use nuclear weapons in the event of an attack.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty does not support the concept of capitalism or communism. Capitalism and communism are economic systems. An economic system is a way of organizing the production and distribution of goods and services."}

The treaty agreed to divide the New World between the two countries. The line of demarcation was to be drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. All land to the west of the line would belong to Portugal, and all land to the east would belong to Spain.\nThe treaty was a response to explorations by Portuguese and Spanish navigators.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nThe political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Many political philosophies have emerged over the past 3,000 years, and each believes that it has found the best way to organize a society. Each philosophy is a set of ideas about how a government should work.\nSome political philosophies try to find a happy medium between different political positions. Other philosophies make a choice between competing ideas.\nFor example, democracy is a political philosophy that believes in spreading power out among a large number of people. It balances the claims of freedom and order by giving people the right to vote on important decisions. But democracy can be chaotic, and other philosophies such as aristocracy and monarchy have been tried in the past.\nAn aristocracy is a system in which a few powerful families hold most of the power. This philosophy believes that these families are best qualified to govern.\nA monarchy is a system in which a single person holds the most power. This person is called a monarch. Monarchy is the oldest form of government.\nOther political philosophies are more extreme. For example, fascism is a philosophy that believes that a government should have absolute power. This can lead to a government that is very strict and that has complete control over the people.\nSome political philosophies are based on ideas that are not related to government. For example, communism is a philosophy that believes that all people should be equal. It claims that there should be no rich or poor people.\nSOLUTION: The text above is a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology. It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past. This means that it did not rely on strong concepts of equality across class boundaries.\nMachiavelli did not believe that people could be ruled according to ethical or religious ideas. He believed that rulers had to be pragmatic and practical. They needed to do whatever would work to maintain their power."}

It must have a clear and stable system of laws, an independent and impartial judiciary to interpret and apply those laws, and a means of resolving disputes that is fair and efficient.\nThe judicial branch of government is responsible for interpreting and applying the laws of the country. When a dispute arises, individuals can argue their case in court. A judge or a jury will review the facts of the case and decide whether the law has been violated. The party who is found to have violated the law is usually ordered to compensate the other party.\nThe legal system also provides remedies for disputes. A remedy is a solution that can be ordered by a judge or a court. For example, a court can order a debtor to pay a creditor.\nExamples of legal systems include the civil law system and the common law system.\nThe civil law system is based on a comprehensive body of law, such as the Napoleonic Code in France. The civil law system is used in most countries in the world.\nThe common law system is based on precedent. This means that lower courts must follow the decisions of higher courts. For example, in the United States, the Supreme Court is the highest court. Lower courts must follow the decisions of the Supreme Court."}

It is known that this trade network encouraged the diffusion of goods, ideas, and cultures. However, the rise of Arabian port cities and the overproduction of cash crops had a major impact on the Indian Ocean trade network.\nThe ability of commerce to foster cultural diffusion:\nCultural diffusion is the spread of ideas and customs from one society to another. The Indian Ocean trade network was a major source of cultural diffusion. As people and goods moved along the trade network, they brought their customs and ideas with them. This led to the spread of new ideas and customs throughout the Indian Ocean world.\nThe superiority of Arabian port cities:\nThe Arabian port cities of Zeila, Aden, and Mokha were important centers for the Indian Ocean trade network. These cities were able to dominate the trade network because they were on the southern route to India, which was the main trading route.\nThe increasing difficulty caused by language barriers:\nAs the Indian Ocean trade network expanded, it became increasingly difficult to communicate with other societies. This difficulty was caused in part by language barriers. Merchants and traders from different societies had different languages that they spoke.\nThe overproduction of cash crops:\nThe Indian Ocean world produced many cash crops, such as spices, textiles, and sugar. These crops were sold to other societies, but overproduction could lead to a drop in prices. This would make it difficult for merchants to sell their crops and make a profit."}

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture.\"\nPaul of Aegina, Epitome: On the Fracture of the Thigh and Nose, late seventh century C.E.\nSource 2:\n\"Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health. The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.\"\nIbn Sina (Avicenna), On Medicine, ca. 1020 C.E.\nThe two passages on medicine illustrate which of the following cultural exchanges that occurred in the period 600\u20131450 C.E.?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The influence of Mesoamerican science on Europeans through systems of trade and navigation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The influence of Chinese science on Islamic civilizations through European immigration to Islamic lands"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The influence of Egyptian science on the Byzantines through European scholars"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The influence of Greek science on Europeans through Byzantine and Islamic scholars"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Many cultures have made significant contributions to science and technology. The following table shows some of the major exchanges in the history of science.\nCultures | Science | Methods\nAncient Egypt | Astronomy | Observed the night sky to learn about the universe.\nAncient Greece | Philosophy | Thought deeply about the nature of the world.\nChina | Technology | Invented paper, gunpowder, and the compass.\nIslam | Optics | Developed advanced lenses for glasses and telescopes.\nEurope | Mathematics | Solutions to many mathematical problems were invented in Europe.\nAsia | Chemistry | Produced many of the world's most important chemicals, such as silk and potassium.\nIf you look at each of these examples, you can see a pattern. Each culture contributed to science in its own way. So, the question of whether the Renaissance was a rebirth of ancient culture is a matter of debate. Some historians believe that the Renaissance was a rebirth of ancient culture. They note that many of the ancient texts that were discovered during the Renaissance contained information that was unknown in Europe for many centuries. Other historians argue that the Renaissance was a transformation of medieval culture. They note that many of the most important Renaissance figures, such as Leonardo da Vinci, were born in the Middle Ages.\nSOLUTION: The Ibn Sina passage explains that medicine is the study of the causes and symptoms of health and disease. This view of medicine shows the influence of ancient Greek science on Islam. The Greek doctor Galen had a large influence on the medicine of Islam.\nThe Paul of Aegina passage suggests that a broken thigh is treated by setting the bone and applying a ligature. This hands-on approach to medicine shows the influence of ancient Greek science on Byzantine medicine."}

American crops, such as potatoes, corn, and tomatoes, allowed farmers to grow more food.\nAnother effect was the spread of diseases. Most people in the Americas had never been exposed to many European diseases. So, these diseases spread quickly and killed many people.\nA third effect was the creation of new trade routes.
