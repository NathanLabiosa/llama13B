It tells you that all elements in a category belong to a certain other category.\nA minor premise is a particular statement. It tells you about some specific element within a category.\nThe conclusion is a statement about the relationship between the categories.\nFor example, the syllogism \"All men are mortal.

It is possible for a person to have a conflict of interests and not be hypocritical. For example, a person who is an accountant may have a financial interest in an accounting firm. This person may have a conflict of interests, but it is not hypocritical for her to support an accounting firm. This is because the person's actions do not go against her claims to have certain beliefs or values.\nA person who is hypocritical may not be aware that they are being hypocritical. They may believe that their actions are consistent with their claims.\nSOLUTION: The answer is D. If someone claims to be concerned about an issue, but then does something that goes against that concern, they are being hypocritical. This is relevant to the truth of the claims. If someone claims to be concerned about an issue, but then does something that goes against that concern, it is evidence that the claims are false."}
