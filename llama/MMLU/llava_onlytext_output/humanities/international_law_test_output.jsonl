The use of force is based on criteria such as the nature of the human rights abuses, the inability of the state to stop them, and the relationship between the state and the civilians.\nThe Responsibility to Protect is a concept that arises from the international community's obligation to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. The international community is committed to taking collective action to protect populations when their governments are unable or unwilling to do so.\nThe Responsibility to Protect includes the use of military force as one of the potential tools available to the international community. However, the primary objective of the Responsibility to Protect is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\nSOLUTION: Responsibility to Protect is different from humanitarian intervention in several ways:\nR2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress, whereas humanitarian intervention does not.\nR2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not.\nR2P's primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis, whereas humanitarian intervention's primary objective is to protect civilians from mass atrocities."}

It is usually written down, as in the United States. But the United Kingdom's constitution is unwritten. This means that it is not in one central location. Instead, the constitution is a collection of laws and customs that have developed over the centuries.\nThe United Kingdom's constitution is made up of several key parts. These include statute law, common law, conventions, and the EU Treaties.\nStatute law is the primary source of law in the United Kingdom. This law is made by the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nCommon law is law that is developed by judges. Judges use prior cases as a guide in deciding new cases. The House of Lords, now called the Supreme Court, is the final arbiter of common law.\nConventions are rules that are not written down. They do not show up in any law. But these rules are followed by some government branches and officials. For example, the convention that the Prime Minister is the leader of the party that wins the most seats in an election is not written down. But it is followed by every Prime Minister.\nThe EU Treaties are agreements that the United Kingdom has signed up to. These agreements create the European Union. The UK Parliament and the European Parliament pass laws that are known as EU regulations. The UK government can also make rules that apply to UK residents. These rules are called UK regulations."}

This term is often used in discussions about the legal consequences of a treaty, such as whether a treaty can create legal rights or duties for or against a non-State actor.\nAn entity may have international legal personality in one of two ways. An entity may be a State, which has the most extensive form of international legal personality. Or, an entity may be a legal person under international law, which is a more limited form of international legal personality.\nA State is a legal person under international law, and this form of international legal personality is the most extensive. A State can perform all of the following under international law:\nenforce its rights by bringing a case against another State in the International Court of Justice;\nenforce its rights by bringing a case against a non-State actor in a national court;\nhave its rights enforced by another State in its capacity as a party to a treaty;\nbe a party to a treaty.\nA non-State actor is not a legal person under international law, and this form of international legal personality is more limited.

The use of force is reasonable when a ordinary observer, looking at the facts of the situation, would agree that the use of force is appropriate.\nThe meaning of proportionality in relation to the options available to the victim State is that the victim State may use any means to defeat and incapacitate the aggressor. This means that the victim State may use force, but the force must be proportionate to the threat.\nFor example, if the aggressor is a large, powerful country threatening to invade a smaller country, the smaller country may not use a proportionate response by launching a nuclear missile. The smaller country's response must be proportionate to the threat. A nuclear missile is a disproportionate response."}

A State's jurisdiction generally begins from its coastline, through its territorial sea, to the outer limit of its contiguous zone.\nThe territorial sea is a zone extending 12 nautical miles from a State's baseline. In this zone, a State has special rights and responsibilities. It has the right to use its waters for certain purposes, such as fishing and exploring for resources. It also has the responsibility to regulate vessel traffic and protect the environment.\nThe contiguous zone is a zone extending from the territorial sea's outer limit (12 nautical miles) up to 24 nautical miles from a State's baseline. In this zone, a State has the right to regulate the activities of vessels that may affect its security, fiscal, or environmental interests.\nThe exclusive economic zone is a zone extending from the contiguous zone's outer limit (24 nautical miles) up to 200 nautical miles from a State's baseline. In this zone, a State has the right to explore and exploit resources, regulate the activities of other States, and protect its environment.\nThe continental shelf is an area beyond the exclusive economic zone. A State has the right to exploit the natural resources of its continental shelf.\nA State may enforce its laws and regulations in each of these zones.

As a representative body, the UNGA has the largest membership of any UN organ. The UNGA has the following main functions:\nConsideration of human rights issues: The UNGA has a Special Committee on Human Rights, and a number of specialized agencies and committees concerned with human rights.\nConsideration of international security and peace: The UNGA has the First Committee, which considers disarmament, and the Fourth Committee, which considers specific security questions.\nConsideration of social, humanitarian, and cultural questions: The UNGA has the Third Committee, which considers human rights, and the Fifth Committee, which considers social and humanitarian issues.\nConsideration of economic and financial questions: The UNGA has the Second Committee, which considers development and environmental issues, and the Sixth Committee, which considers legal questions.\nThe UNGA also has the power to make recommendations to states and to serve as a forum for the consideration of issues.\nThe role of the UNGA in the making of international law is an important question. The answer is that the UNGA has the power to make recommendations, but its resolutions are not considered to be international legal sources.\nInternational law is made up of three main types of law: treaties, customary law, and judicial decisions.\nA treaty is an agreement between two or more countries. Treaties can be used to make international law.\nCustomary law is made up of rules that are widely accepted by states. For a rule to be considered customary law, states must accept the rule and follow it. Customary law can also be used to make international law.\nJudicial decisions are decisions made by courts. Some courts can hear cases between states. These courts can decide what the law is between states. National courts can use these decisions to make national law.\nA resolution of the UN General Assembly is not a treaty, a source of customary law, or a judicial decision. So, a resolution of the UN General Assembly is not a source of international law."}

It is signed by the leaders of the countries, and it is binding on the countries. A treaty does not need to be approved by a country's legislators, such as a parliament, to take effect.\nA treaty can create obligations and rights for the countries that sign it. Obligations are things that a country is required to do. Rights are things that a country is entitled to do.\nFor example, a treaty may obligate each country to destroy its chemical weapons and may give each country the right to inspect the other country to ensure that it is complying with the treaty.\nCountries that are not part of a treaty are called third States. Third States do not have the same obligations or rights as the countries that signed the treaty.\nBut third States may be able to get the benefit of a treaty. For example, if country A and country B sign a treaty saying that country B will not use torture, country A may be able to trust that country B will not use torture. This is because country A has the right to expect that country B will comply with the treaty."}

Over time, these laws have become so accepted by states that they become part of customary law.\nCustomary law is not written down in any one place. Instead, it is created by the repeated practices of states.\nSome customary laws are also part of domestic law. As a result, a state's practices with respect to a particular legal question must be assessed in order to determine whether that legal question is part of the state's customary law.\nA treaty is an agreement between two or more states.

The United States is an example of a country with a federal system of government. In the international area, many countries have signed treaties or conventions to establish formal rules of behavior.\nOther international societies have a different structure. In an anarchic society, there is no highest authority to enforce the rules. There is no world government. Each country is on its own. In the absence of a higher authority, countries must decide their own rules of behavior.\nInternational society is made up of a constellation of powerful States and other international organizations. In this view, there is a hierarchy of authority, but the hierarchy is more complex than a simple vertical structure. For example, the hierarchy of authority can be diagonal. For example, some international organizations have more power than some countries.\nSome countries are more powerful than others. The most powerful countries in the world have a greater ability to affect events outside their own borders. But the most powerful countries cannot control events everywhere.\nSOLUTION: The structure of the international society is not vertical, diagonal, or anarchic. It follows the vertical model of the domestic legal orders. In this model, there is a hierarchy of authority. At the top of the hierarchy are the most powerful countries. At the bottom are the least powerful countries."}

These norms are created and circulated among states, and they are viewed as binding by the states that follow them.\nThere are two ways that a customary international law norm becomes part of domestic (national) law:\nIncorporation: The norm becomes part of the domestic law, and it is treated as if it were a domestic law.\nPreference: The norm becomes a factor in the interpretation of domestic law. If there is a conflict between a customary international law norm and a domestic law, the customary international law norm may be used to interpret the domestic law.\nWhether a customary international law norm is incorporated into domestic law or given preference in the interpretation of domestic law, the norm is treated in the same way as a domestic law. If a state violates a customary international law norm that has been incorporated into its domestic law, an aggrieved party can use domestic courts to seek relief. If a customary international law norm is given preference in the interpretation of a domestic law, a state or a private party can use domestic courts to seek relief if they believe that the domestic law is inconsistent with the customary international law norm.\nSOLUTION: There are no limitations to the incorporation of customary crimes under English law.

This theory emphasizes that the international community, or certain countries within it, have the power to decide which countries are recognized as members of the community.\nAccording to the constitutive theory, a country is a member of the community of nations only if it is recognized as such. This recognition is not merely a factual statement about the country's status; it has the effect of creating the country's membership. In other words, a country's membership is created by its recognition.\nThe constitutive theory is different from the declarative theory of recognition. The declarative theory says that a country is a member of the community of nations when other countries recognize it as such. According to the declarative theory, a country's membership is not created by its recognition.\nSOLUTION: The constitutive theory of recognition is the correct answer.\nThe choice emphasizes that recognition requires constitutional approval by third nations.

This means that the coastal State has the right to explore and exploit, manage, and regulate the natural resources in its EEZ.\nA third State is allowed to fish in a EEZ only if the coastal State allows it. A third State may not fish in a EEZ without the prior agreement of the coastal State.\nA third State may not claim that it has fishing rights in a EEZ simply because it is located near the EEZ.\nA coastal State is not required to give third States access to its EEZ. Even if a third State is a neighbor of the coastal State, the coastal State is not required to give the third State access to its EEZ.\nA coastal State may give other States access to its EEZ. If a coastal State chooses to give other States access to its EEZ, it can decide on its own criteria to grant these access. For example, a coastal State may give priority to neighboring States or to developing States.\nSOLUTION: When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States. This is the answer. It is the only choice that reflects the requirements of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea."}

This power includes the ability to make, enforce, and interpret laws. The government is accountable to the public for its actions.\nThe government has the duty to treat its citizens as equal, to protect their rights, and to promote their general welfare. When the government fails to act in accordance with these duties, citizens may conclude that the government has committed an injustice.\nThe law provides remedies for injustices committed by the government. These remedies may include money damages, injunctions, and declaratory judgments.\nAn act jure gestionis is a legal act undertaken by the government in the exercise of its management functions. Some examples of acts jure gestionis include:\nenforcing a law\nissuing a regulation\noperating a hospital\ngranting a permit\nAn act jure gestionis is not the same as an official act. An official act is an act undertaken by a public official within the official's official duties. An official act can be a legal act jure gestionis or an illegal act.\nFor example, a judge's decision to sentence a defendant is an official act. The decision is an act undertaken within the judge's official duties. It is not an act jure gestionis, however, because the judge is not acting in his or her capacity as a government official."}

This means that, in the United States, the provisions of a constitutional treaty are as much a part of the \"law of the land\" as are the provisions of the U.S. Constitution.\nThe United States is a party to many international organizations, and in most cases, the ratifying domestic implementing legislation has been enacted. However, thelack of implementing legislation does not leave the United States unable to perform its treaty obligations. The U.S. government can still enter into contracts to perform the nation's obligations under a treaty.\nThe international organizations described in the Tin Council case are headquartered in London. The International Tin Council is an international organization, and the consequence of the absence of implementing legislation in England is that individuals do not derive rights and duties from its founding treaty in the English legal system."}

For example, a state may agree to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. If the state performs the act of reducing emissions, it is legally obligated to do so.\nOther unilateral acts are political in nature and have no legal effect. For example, a state may declare that it is committed to fighting climate change. This declaration is a political act with no legal effect.\nA unilateral act may also be an act that is necessary to be bound by a treaty.

One of the most important of these principles is that the courts of one country will not allow themselves to be used to violate the laws of another country. This is known as the act of state doctrine.\nThe act of state doctrine prevents courts from examining the acts of foreign states or their officials. This is because the other country's courts may have a different interpretation of the acts in question, and examining them in one country's courts could implicate the other country's sovereignty.\nThe act of state doctrine can be a bar to litigation.

In other words, when a treaty is ratified, it becomes the law of the land, just like a federal statute. Therefore, if a treaty requires a court to decide a case a certain way, the court should do so, even if the treaty does not expressly give the court the authority to decide the case in that way.\nThis doctrine applies to all treaties, not just those that have been incorporated into federal law. Treaties are agreements between the United States and one or more other countries. They can be made for a variety of reasons, such as to establish peace between nations or to combine the efforts of multiple countries to solve a common problem.\nThe United States has entered into many treaties, and some of these treaties have been ratified. Treaties that have been ratified become part of the United States' legal system, just like federal statutes.\nThe Constitution says that treaties are the supreme law of the land. This means that when a treaty and a federal statute conflict, the treaty will be followed. This can happen when a treaty is more specific about what should happen in a particular situation."}

These measures can include orders to stop a party from taking a particular action, or to maintain the status quo until the Court decides the case.\nThe purpose of provisional measures is to ensure that the subject of the case is not destroyed or altered before the Court has a chance to issue a final decision. For example, if a state is accused of violating the human rights of an individual, the Court may issue provisional measures to prevent the state from expelling the individual before the Court has a chance to decide the case.\nProvisional measures are not binding until the Court issues a final decision.

For example, a countermeasure that causes severe economic harm to the respondent State is disproportionate.\nA countermeasure is in violation of a peremptory norm of international law when it amounts to a fundamental violation of the principles of international law. For example, a countermeasure that involves the use of force is in violation of a peremptory norm.\nCountermeasures are illegal when they are taken in the course of an armed conflict.\nA state is not permitted to use force in international relations, except in self-defense.

As the Court has stated, the Convention must be observed in the light of the 'vast progress in international law and in the matters dealt with by the Convention' and must be seen as an 'evolutive' instrument.\nThe living instrument principle has been applied in a number of cases. For example, in Golder v. UK, the Court held that the right to free elections in the Convention was an evolving concept that had to be interpreted in the light of changing values. In A v. UK, the Court held that the right to free elections was part of the 'living instrument' of the Convention and could be interpreted in light of changes in society.\nThe living instrument principle has also been applied in cases concerning the interpretation of the rights to private and family life, to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, and to freedom of expression.\nSOLUTION: The case that best illustrates the living instrument principle is A v. UK (2009). In this case, the Court held that the right to free elections was part of the 'living instrument' of the Convention and could be interpreted in light of changes in society.

This means that a sovereign cannot be sued in the courts of another state without its consent. The concept of immunity is based on the theory that a sovereign is immune from suit because of its sovereign status.\nThe idea behind the immunity of a sovereign is that a sovereign is immune from lawsuits in the courts of another state without its consent. This immunity applies to public acts as well as to private acts.\nA public act is an act that a sovereign does in connection with its official duties. A sovereign is immune from suit for private acts. A private act is an act that a sovereign does in connection with his or her private affairs.\nThe Pinochet case concerned the immunity of a former head of State. In the case, the House of Lords decided that former heads of State cease to enjoy personal immunity for acts committed while in office. This decision means that former heads of State can be sued in the courts of another state for acts that they committed while in office.\nSOLUTION: The Pinochet case confirmed that former heads of State cease to enjoy personal immunity once removed from office. This means that a former head of State can be sued in the courts of another state for acts that he or she committed while in office."}

One of their jobs is to use the Constitution and laws to resolve disputes. When a dispute involves a question about whether a law or the Constitution means what it says, justices and courts may interpret those laws and the Constitution.\nInterpretation is the process of explaining what a law or the Constitution means. Interpretation is different from application, which is the process of using a law or the Constitution to resolve a dispute.\nAs an example, consider a dispute about whether a student government association can make students pay to use the association's bathroom.\nThe Constitution does not directly speak to this issue. But the Constitution does require that students have equal protection of the law. \"Equal protection\" means that students have the same rights and have to follow the same rules.\nIf the student government association is allowed to charge some students to use the bathroom, and not charge other students, that is not equal. So, the association's actions probably violate the Constitution.\nSOLUTION: The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo took place immediately after the First World War.\nThe war crimes trials introduced a 'crime against humanity' as an offence.\nThe war crimes trials held individuals legally responsible for acts such as war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nThe war crimes trials found that \"superior orders\" could not be used as a defence for war crimes or crimes against humanity."}

But this provision does not apply to security councils or international courts and tribunals.\nThere are no limits to the application of article 103 of the UN Charter.\nThis means that article 103 can prevail over any other agreement or treaty. Article 103 does not have to compete with other laws or agreements.\nArticle 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms.\nJus cogens norms are the most fundamental principles of international law. These norms cannot be overridden by any agreement or treaty. As a result, article 103 of the UN Charter cannot violate jus cogens norms.\nWhen a case is submitted to the ICJ, article 103 ceases to have any effect.\nThe International Court of Justice is the main judicial organ of the United Nations. When a case is submitted to the ICJ, article 103 of the UN Charter ceases to have any effect. This is because the ICJ is a multilateral treaty, and article 103 states that the Charter shall prevail over any other agreement or treaty."}

These rules are made and enforced by countries, and they have the full force of law. There are many places where international law and domestic law (the set of rules that govern a country's relationships within its own borders) may conflict. When this happens, the domestic law and international law may be used to interpret the legal outcome of a case.\nA country's domestic law does not get to dictate the international community's interpretation of its obligations under international law. For example, if an international treaty says that a country must allow free trade with other countries, the country cannot use its domestic law to prevent this."}
