How do human beings organize themselves? What social and technical innovations have they developed? How do they meet the basic needs of life? How do they organize their political and economic life? What are the consequences of different ways of organizing?\nOne of the basic ways that people organize themselves is through social stratification. A pattern of social integration in which individuals are placed into a hierarchy of social levels is called social stratification.\nThere are many ways that people have developed to create social strata: by wealth, by income, by social class, by kinship, by race, or by ethnicity. But whatever the basis of stratification, some people will hold a higher social status than others.\nThe specific ways in which a society is stratified determine the opportunities and the obligations of its members. For example, a society with a strong caste system has strictly defined roles for each social caste. A society with a weak stratification system has more flexible roles and opportunities for its members.\nSOLUTION: A necropolis is a cemetery. It is a place where the dead are buried.\nUrbanization is the process by which cities grow and change. It is not a pattern of social integration.\nA social system is a set of beliefs and customs that is followed by a society.

This evolution was not a smooth process, but rather a turbulent one in which many different human societies coexisted.\nHunting and gathering societies are called foraging societies. Foraging societies do not have to produce their own food. Instead, they gather wild plants and hunt wild animals. Foraging societies have little need for tools and machines, because food is available without them. Foraging societies are usually small, because they can't produce their own food.\nFarming societies are called agri-societies. Agri-societies are able to produce their own food. This makes them able to support large populations. Farming societies need tools and machines to produce their food.

You want to buy some grain, but the merchant has many different types of containers for sale. You need a way to compare the containers' capacities.\nThe Indus Valley people solved this problem by using standardized weights. They used a small, flat weight called a gansa. The gansa had an inscribed symbol that told you the weight of the gansa.\nMost of the gansas had a weight of between 1 and 5 gansas. A 1-gansa weight was lighter than a 5-gansa weight.\nThese weights were used to balance scales.

We have many examples of art and symbolic artifacts from modern humans, but few such artifacts have survived from earlier periods. Hence, we have a better understanding of modern humans than of our ancestors.\nSOLUTION: The most ancient characteristic of modern humans is symbolic expression through the production of art. Art is a symbolic artifact, and it requires a level of abstraction and imagination that is not required by utilitarian tools or weapons.\nSome researchers believe that the use of symbols and the production of art is what made humans special and allowed them to evolve larger brains. Many scientists think that Homo sapiens evolved larger brains to keep up with the increasing complexity of the world around us. This complexity grew in part because of the symbols and language that early humans used to describe and interact with that world."}

{"question": "Which of the following are four of the characteristics of civilization?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "food surpluses, specialists, urban settlements, and a system of record keeping"}, {"label": "B", "text": "food surpluses, a standing army, artwork, and a system of plumbing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "food surpluses, monumental architecture, religious buildings, and museums"}, {"label": "D", "text": "museums, libraries, monumental architecture, and artwork"}], "answerKey": "A", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Characteristics of civilization include food surpluses, specialists, urban settlements, a system of record keeping, and monumental architecture.\nFood surpluses: Agriculture, or the science and practice of farming, allows people to grow their own food. Agriculture was first developed around 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, in the area that is now Iraq. The development of agriculture allowed for food surpluses, or extra food that can be stored and saved for later use. Food surpluses allowed people to start settling in one place instead of moving around in search of food.\nSpecialists: As communities grew, it became possible for people to specialize in different types of work. This specialization allowed for the exchange of goods and services. For example, a farmer could grow food and trade it for goods or services made by a specialist. Specialization also allowed people to become more efficient at their jobs.\nUrban settlements: Food surpluses and specialization made it possible for people to live year-round in one place. This way of living was first done in cities such as Uruk in ancient Sumer. Cities grew up around ancient civilizations because they provided a place for specialists to live and work together.\nA system of record keeping: To conduct business and keep track of transactions, people in ancient civilizations developed a system of writing. This writing allowed people to keep records of their transactions. These records were used to keep track of how goods were distributed and to make plans for the future.\nMonumental architecture: Ancient civilizations built monumental architecture, or large, impressive buildings. These buildings were built to honor the gods or to commemorate great leaders. The Great Pyramid of Giza, in Egypt, is an example of monumental architecture."}

By about 300,000 years ago, early humans began to use fire, and this changed the atmosphere. Around 12,000 years ago, human use of agriculture greatly increased. Agriculture involves living in one place and growing crops. This way of life altered the atmosphere further.\nIn the last 250 years, human activities have changed the atmosphere in new and dangerous ways. Many of these changes are due to the use of fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas releases pollutants into the air. These pollutants include carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides.\nCarbon dioxide is a pollutant that stays in the atmosphere for a long time. It is released when fossil fuels are burned. Carbon dioxide is called a greenhouse gas. It traps heat from the sun. The trapped heat is called a greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect keeps Earth warm. But too much of it can cause temperatures to rise, which is called global warming.\nSOLUTION: Gobekli Tepe has monumental earthworks that date back around 11,000 years. This site is the oldest and has the most pillars."}

Under mit'a, each person had to work for the state for one month in every ten years. In return, the state would provide for that person's basic needs.\nWhen the Incan Empire was formed, the ruler, Pachacuti, was inspired to change this system. He wanted to create a labor system that would be fairer and more useful to the empire.\nSo, between 1438 and 1450, Pachacuti created a new labor system called the mit'a system. Under this system, each person between the ages of 18 and 50 was required to work for the state for one month. The government assigned each person to a mit'a project, such as working on a bridge or road.\nThe mit'a system had several important effects on the Incan Empire:\nIt helped to improve the empire's infrastructure, such as roads and bridges.\nIt kept people healthy and strong, which was important for the labor-intensive life of the Andes.\nIt helped to reduce the wealth gap between rich and poor.\nIt gave people a sense of pride in their work and in the empire."}

Institutions are the unwritten rules and norms that guide behavior. In every society, institutions are so common and accepted that people may not even think about them. For example, people may not consciously decide how money is used in their society, but money is an institution that nonetheless affects every aspect of social life.\nInstitutions can be classified as either external or internal to societies. External institutions are concerned with the relationships among groups of people. Religion, law, and politics are external institutions. Internal institutions are concerned with the relationships among individuals within groups. Family and education are internal institutions.\nSOLUTION: A conflict model of state development emphasizes the importance of external tensions in the development of state societies. For example, the tension between different religious groups led to the development of the modern nation-state in Europe. An integration model of state development emphasizes the importance of internal tensions in the development of state societies. For example, the tension between family members in a small-scale society might lead to the development of a more centralized society."}

This idea is supported by several key pieces of evidence.\nFirst, fossils of apelike animals that are believed to be the ancestors of humans have been found in Africa.\nSecond, Africa is home to many different types of humans, or races, as well as to a wide variety of apes. This suggests that humans and apes may have evolved together in Africa.\nThird, languages change over time. By studying the languages of Asia, Africa, and Europe, scientists can learn about how humans migrated from Africa to the rest of the world.\nSOLUTION: Most scientists believe that anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago. Then, about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, a group of humans migrated out of Africa and spread into western Europe, Asia, and eventually the Americas.

As people moved from a nomadic to a sedentary lifestyle, they began to cultivate plants. Initially, they selected plants that were most desirable and that grew in the greatest abundance. This process of selecting plants for cultivation, called artificial selection, was the first step in domestication.\nOver many years, people domesticated plants by carefully tending them and by selecting the most desirable plants to plant each season. This process of selecting plants for desirable traits is called selective breeding.\nThe use of fire to manage land also was an important part of the Neolithic Revolution. People burned woodlands and grasslands to create areas of grassland. Grasses, like wheat and barley, are rich in carbohydrates, which make them ideal for human consumption.\nDomestication of animals followed a similar pattern. People began to tame and breed animals for food and fur. Like plants, animals were first selected for domestication based on desirable traits. Unlike plants, however, animals had to be tamed before they could be domesticated.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nAround 7000 B.C., people in the Fertile Crescent independently domesticated many plants and animals. These plants and animals included grains such as wheat and barley, and animals such as cows, sheep, and pigs.\nEuropean Neolithic people did not import most of their crops and animals from other regions. Instead, they domesticated many of the plants and animals that they used."}

The Inca empire had never seen horses before, and they were afraid of them. The Spanish soldiers' muskets also frightened the Incas. They had never seen such loud noises from a weapon before.\nThe empire had never won the allegiance of the peoples it had conquered. The Inca empire had conquered many people, but those people had never become loyal to the emperor. They had never felt like they were part of the Inca empire.

Some changes are a response to the environment, while others are the result of social and economic changes.\nBelow are some ways that cultures have changed over time. You can decide which describes the progression of your own culture.\nUnilineal evolution: This model sees cultures as changing in a linear, one-directional progression. A culture's practices and ways of living are assumed to change in the same way, in a single, inevitable direction.\nFor example, many people in the 19th century believed that all cultures progressed from hunter-gatherer to agrarian to industrial.\nEnvironmental uniformitarianism: This model sees cultures as changing in response to the environment. Changes in a culture's practices and ways of living are assumed to be a response to the environment.\nFor example, many people today use wind turbines and solar panels. This is a response to the need to find alternative sources of energy.\nMulticultural adaptation: This model sees cultures as changing in response to social and economic changes. A culture's practices and ways of living can change in many different ways.\nFor example, many people today are using social media to communicate. This is a change from the past, but it is not a linear progression.\nMultilineal evolution: This model sees cultures as changing along multiple paths. A culture's practices and ways of living can change in different ways at different times.\nFor example, in the 20th century, many people in different parts of the world have adopted many different ways of living. These changes were not all in the same direction."}

The materials used for these tools have varied widely, from the simplest bone or wood to the most advanced metal alloys. But most tools and weapons have had a few things in common. They have had to be tough and sharp. And they have had to be carefully shaped and balanced.\nStone was a common material for early tools. Humans have used stone tools for millions of years. The earliest stone tools were made by hitting a piece of flint with a hammerstone to knock off a piece of the flint. The resulting sharp edge could be used as a knife.\nAround 25,000 years ago, humans learned how to make stone tools with sharp edges. They did this by heating the stones to make them soft. This is how the first metal tools were made.\nHumans have since developed many other ways to make tools and weapons. But the basic ideas of using sharp, tough materials and carefully shaping and balancing them have remained the same.\nSOLUTION: The Upper Paleolithic is associated with new and improved stone tool technologies.\nDuring the Upper Paleolithic, humans made many advances in tool technology. They developed finer blades and edges. They also developed new tools, such as harpoons for hunting fish."}

By examining the rings, scientists can determine the exact year that a tree grew to its current height.\nSOLUTION: Dendrochronology is used to date wooden artifacts. A wooden artifact is a piece of wood that is at least a few years old. Some wooden artifacts are very old. For example, the oldest known wooden architectural elements are from the ancient city of Jericho. Dendrochronology can determine the age of these artifacts.\nPaleomagnetic dating, fission-track dating, and radiocarbon dating are all different dating techniques.\nPaleomagnetic dating determines the age of a rock or an object made of rock.\nFission-track dating measures the age of a rock or an object made of rock.\nRadiocarbon dating measures the age of an object made of organic material."}

About 10,000 years ago, people in Asia began to make farming tools out of stone. These tools were more useful than tools made out of wood or bone because stone can last a long time.\nTo make a stone tool, you need to chip a piece of stone to the right shape. This is called knapping. It is hard to knap stone, and it takes a lot of practice.\nHow did the Hoabinhian people make their stone tools?\nThe Hoabinhian people used a method called soft hammer knapping to make their tools. They held a piece of stone in their laps and struck it with a smaller piece of stone. This made the larger piece of stone chip off in the right shape.\nSOLUTION: The tradition of making stone tools from chipped pebbles, called Hoabinhian, comes from Asia."}

Bipedalism is believed to have evolved first among hominids because it had many survival advantages. Bipedalism made it easier for early hominids to walk long distances to find food, and it allowed early hominids to use their arms for reaching and manipulating objects. Larger crania and brains may have evolved to help early hominids learn new skills and solve new problems.\nOldowan stone tools were the first tools made by hominids. They were simple, sharp-edged tools made by flaking one side of a stone.\nLanguage is difficult to evolve. It requires a complex set of abilities, including the ability to produce and comprehend complex sounds, to use language in social situations, and to learn language.\nSOLUTION: Oldowan stone tools were the first tools made by hominids. They were simple, sharp-edged tools made by flaking one side of a stone."}

She theorized that the reason for this is that older women are more invested in the welfare of their grandchildren. Because children are more vulnerable to disease and other dangers, the presence of an interested and invested grandmother can increase the chances that her grandchildren will survive.\nThe \"grandmother effect\" refers to the decrease in child mortality associated with the presence of older generations.\nSOLUTION: The passage tells you that the \"grandmother effect\" refers to the decrease in child mortality associated with the presence of older generations. This means that the presence of older people in a community can help to decrease the death rate among children."}

In these societies, power was in the hands of rulers who had vast amounts of wealth at their disposal. Members of the ruling class built monumental architecture, acquired vast territories, and amassed fortunes. But were they merely wasteful and extravagant, or were there deeper reasons for their conspicuous consumption?\nOne reason for the conspicuous consumption of the elite was to display their wealth and power. These monuments and possessions were also used as symbols to reinforce the inequalities on which state societies are based. For example, the pyramids of ancient Egypt, the Forbidden City in Beijing, and the stately homes of Europe's aristocracy were all built to display the power and wealth of the ruling classes.\nAnother reason for the conspicuous consumption of the elite was to stimulate the economy. In ancient Rome, for example, the elite bought luxury items from across the empire, creating a thriving market for goods and services.\nA monetary value was not placed on material possessions, making things effectively worthless.\nDemocracy and egalitarian states had not yet evolved."}
{"question": "Archaeological evidence for the production of cheese and yogurt in Europe suggests that dairying became an important part of subsistence by ______ years ago, with _______ providing an adaptive advantage.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "10,000; artificial selection for certain varieties of cheese"}, {"label": "B", "text": "7,500; the lactase persistence mutation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5,500; domesticated cattle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3,500; certain strains of lactose-free cheese and yogurt"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: In many countries, dairying began between 7,500 and 5,500 years ago, when people began to domesticate cattle. Domesticated cattle produce milk that is higher in fat and protein than the milk of wild cattle. This more nutritious milk was safer for humans to drink.\nBefore the lactase persistence mutation, people could not drink milk after weaning because they did not have the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose in milk. Lactase persistence is a mutation that causes the body to continue producing lactase after childhood. This mutation appeared about 7,500 years ago.\nThe lactase persistence mutation was a major evolutionary advantage for people who lived in countries where milk was a reliable source of food. Today, about 90% of people worldwide who are not of African descent are lactase persistent.\nSOLUTION: Archaeological evidence shows that people in Europe began producing cheese and yogurt at least 7,500 years ago. The lactase persistence mutation was a major evolutionary advantage for people who lived in countries where milk was a reliable source of food. This mutation allowed people to drink milk after childhood, which was safer and provided more nutrients."}

These people obtained their food by hunting animals and collecting wild plants. Where they lived depended on the availability of food.\nHunter-gatherer societies had to move regularly to find food. They could not carry a lot of food with them because it was difficult to carry heavy food over long distances. As a result, they were limited in what they could do.\nLater, some hunters and gatherers began to grow their own food. This was the beginning of farming. Farming became the most common way of life because it was more efficient. People who lived near farms could grow their own food and had a more reliable source of food.\nSOLUTION: The presence of caribou bones near the Hudson River valley in New York from a site dated 10,000 years ago implies that the main food source was caribou meat."}

These sacrifices have included animals, food, and objects. But human sacrifice was rare.\nAmong the ancient Maya, human sacrifice was one of the methods used to appease the gods. Maya priests performed human sacrifice during times of hardship, such as after a disastrous war. Maya rulers also performed human sacrifice to celebrate their victories.\nSOLUTION: Inca human sacrifice was preceded by ritual starvation, torture, and blood sacrifice.\nThe Inca Empire did not have a long history of human sacrifice. But after the Inca ruler Huayna Capac died in 1527, his sons fought for control of the empire. To decide who should be the new ruler, the princes agreed to carry out a human sacrifice. The victim was a young girl chosen from the ruling class. She was sacrificed, and the princes divided the empire between themselves."}
