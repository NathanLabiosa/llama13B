Second messengers are involved in many cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and communication.\nInositol triphosphate is a second messenger that helps to stimulate the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. When inositol triphosphate is released from a cell's membrane, it binds to and activates a variety of proteins, such as calcium-activated chloride channels. This activation causes a decrease in the concentration of chloride ions in the cytoplasm, which leads to an increase in the concentration of calcium ions. This increase in calcium ions can then trigger various responses, such as the release of stored calcium ions.\nCyclic AMP is a second messenger that helps to regulate many important cellular processes. It is made by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which changes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP can bind to and activate a variety of proteins, such as protein kinases. When cyclic AMP activates protein kinases, they can change the function of various target proteins.\nProstaglandins are hormone-like substances that are involved in many body functions, such as inflammation and pain. Prostaglandins can cause some of their effects by stimulating the release of calcium ions from cells.\nCalmodulin is a protein that helps to integrate signals from multiple second messengers within a cell. Calmodulin binds to calmodulin-dependent proteins, which are involved in many cellular processes. When calmodulin binds to these proteins, it can change their function."}

This type of cell division is called distinct cleavage.\nThe type of cleavage plane that forms affects the way the dividing cells line up next to each other. There are three main types of cleavage planes. In animals with these types of cleavage planes, the cells line up in a specific pattern relative to each other.\nRadial cleavage is a type of cleavage plane that is found in some animals.

A gene contains instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nAn organism's genes may have different forms, or alleles. An organism's genes may have one or more alleles. For example, the gene for human blood type has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for blood type A, and the allele f is for blood type B.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, an organism's genotype for the blood type gene is either FF, Ff, or ff.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable combination of alleles for that trait. An organism's phenotype for blood type is either blood type A or blood type B.\nAn organism's genes may have different mobile forms. A mobile form of a gene is called a transposable element, or transposon. Transposable elements can change position within an organism's genome.\nIntrons and exons are parts of a gene. An intron is a section of a gene that is not translated into a protein. An exon is a section of a gene that is translated into a protein.\nSome genes have introns.

An organism's genotype for an intron-containing gene is its combination of exon alleles. So, an organism's genotype for the blood type gene is either FF, Ff, or ff.\nSome genes do not have introns. These genes are called intron-less genes. In an intron-less gene, there are no introns. An organism's genotype for an intron-less gene is its combination of exon alleles. So, an organism's genotype for the blood type gene is either AA, Aa, or aa.\nTransposons are mobile regions of DNA that can move within an organism's genome. A transposon can change its position within a chromosome.\nA transposon is made of two parts: a transposable element and a transposase. The transposable element is the mobile part of the transposon. The transposable element contains the genes that are moved. The transposase is the enzyme that cuts the transposable element and pastes it into a new position.\nCistrons and transposons are mobile regions of DNA that can insert themselves into an existing genome. A cistron is a piece of hereditary material that is passed from parents to offspring. A cistron is made up of exons. A cistron's exons can be moved into a different order within an organism's genome.\nIntrons are mobile regions of DNA that can be removed or rearranged.

Primary succession continues until a new ecosystem is established.\nSecondary succession occurs when a previous ecosystem is removed, such as a forest fire or a flood that covers an area with water. Secondary succession can also begin on a barren substrate, but the substrate is not truly bare. Instead, it has a thin layer of soil that was deposited by the previous ecosystem. Secondary succession can also begin in an ecosystem that was not completely removed. For example, a forest fire that killed most of the trees in a woods is a secondary succession.

Hairy leaves can help plants conserve water by reducing the surface area through which water can evaporate.\nAdaptations of plants to minimize water loss in environments with high temperatures include:\nThin cuticles. The cuticle is a waxy layer on the surface of a leaf. A thin cuticle can help a plant conserve water. Thin cuticles reduce the amount of evaporation that occurs from the surface of a leaf.\nLarge surface-to-volume ratios. Large surface-to-volume ratios can help plants conserve water. A large surface area allows plants to take in more carbon dioxide. But a large surface area also means that water can evaporate more quickly.

The sarcomere is responsible for the contraction and relaxation of the muscle.\nThe sarcomere is made up of two main proteins: tropomyosin and myosin. Tropomyosin is a thin, flexible protein that helps give the sarcomere its structure. Myosin is a thick protein that gives the sarcomere its strength.\nTroponin is another protein that interacts with tropomyosin. When calcium ions are present, troponin changes its shape. This change in shape causes tropomyosin to move, exposing the myosin binding sites on the actin.\nThis illustration shows how the sarcomere functions during contraction.\nWhen the muscle is not contracting, tropomyosin is positioned to cover the myosin binding sites on the actin. This covers blocks the myosin binding sites on the actin. This prevents myosin from binding to the actin and causing the muscle to contract.\nWhen the muscle is contracting, troponin changes its shape. This change in shape causes tropomyosin to move, exposing the myosin binding sites on the actin. This allows myosin to bind to the actin and causes the muscle to contract.\nSOLUTION: The correct statement is that during contraction, H zones become elongated. The H zone is the middle part of the myosin protein. When the muscle is contracting, the H zone pulls the actin filament closer to the center of the sarcomere."}

An organism's genes affect its traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore inherit their traits, from their parents.\nAn organism's genes may have different forms, or alleles. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of alleles for that gene.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nAn organism's genotype and phenotype for a gene are determined by the organism's combination of alleles. An organism's genotype is determined by its combination of alleles for a gene. An organism's phenotype is determined by its combination of alleles for a trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Masting (synchronous fruiting) is a trait in oak trees. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for synchronous fruiting, and the allele f is for scattered fruiting.\nAn oak tree has two alleles for the masting gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent. An oak tree's genotype for the masting gene is its combination of alleles for the gene. So, a tree may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the masting gene.\nAn oak tree's phenotype for the masting trait is its combination of alleles for the trait. So, a tree may have a phenotype of synchronous fruiting or scattered fruiting for the masting trait.\nOak trees do not have natural enemies that can eat their fruit. So, masting does not have a strong effect on oak tree survival or reproduction. As a result, masting is not affected by natural selection."}

This can lead to a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide in the person's blood. When the body's carbon dioxide levels decrease, the body's pH can increase. This is because carbon dioxide reacts with water in the blood to form carbonic acid, which decreases the pH of the blood.\nWhen carbonic acid breaks down, it produces a base called bicarbonate. The bicarbonate can combine with hydrogen ions to form carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can help to lower the pH of the blood.\nSOLUTION: An increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions both describe the change in the person's blood caused by hyperventilation."}

Intracellular messengers can have a rapid effect on the cell's activities.\nThere are many different types of intracellular messengers, but they can be grouped into three categories based on how they are used by the cell:\n1. Second messengers: These messengers act as intermediaries in a signaling pathway.

They can make chemical reactions go faster.\nAn enzyme's activity depends on its ability to bind to a substrate. The enzyme and substrate bind together. Then, the enzyme's active site interacts with the substrate's active site to form an enzyme-substrate complex.\nThe enzyme-substrate complex undergoes a reaction. The reaction takes place in the active site. The enzyme-substrate complex is then broken apart. This process releases the enzyme and the substrate.\nSOLUTION: If the activity of an enzyme is constant over a broad range of pH values, it is likely that ionizing groups on both the enzyme and substrate participate in the reaction.\nIonizing groups are groups of atoms that can donate or accept electrons. These groups can change from one type to another when an enzyme reacts with its substrate. For example, an enzyme's substrate can donate electrons to an ionizing group on the enzyme. This change in the ionizing group can help the enzyme-substrate complex react.\nIf the enzyme can react with its substrate over a broad range of pH values, it means that ionizing groups on both the enzyme and substrate do not change over this pH range. So, these ionizing groups do not affect the enzyme's activity."}

An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of allele types for that gene.\nFor example, the gene for pea plant height has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for tall plants, and the allele f is for dwarf plants. Each pea plant has two alleles for the plant height gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for the plant height gene is its combination of alleles for the gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the plant height gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for plant height is its combination of allele types for the gene. So, a pea plant may have a phenotype of tall plants or dwarf plants for plant height.\nSome alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different phenotypes to appear as a organism's phenotype. For example, in pea plants, the F allele, which causes tall plants, is dominant over the f allele. This means that a pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's phenotype. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have tall plants. A plant with the genotype ff will have dwarf plants.\nOther alleles have types called co-dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different phenotypes to appear as a organism's phenotype. In pea plants, the F allele and the f allele are co-dominant. This means that a pea plant with at least one F or f allele will have a mixed phenotype. A plant with the genotype FF, Ff, or ff will have plants that are a mix of tall and dwarf.\nSOLUTION: The tall violet allele is D, and the tall white allele is W. The dwarf violet allele is d, and the dwarf white allele is w.\nThe tall violet allele is completely dominant over the dwarf violet allele. This means D is dominant over d.\nThe tall white allele is completely dominant over the dwarf white allele. This means W is dominant over w.\nSo, the tall violet allele is dominant over the dwarf violet and dwarf white alleles. The tall white allele is dominant over the dwarf white allele.\nThe only way to get the tall violet and tall white alleles is to inherit them from both parents. So, the tall violet, tall white alleles are not expected in the progeny.\nThe only way to get the dwarf violet and dwarf white alleles is to inherit them from both parents. So, the dwarf violet, dwarf white alleles are not expected in the progeny.\nThe only way to get the mixed violet and white alleles is to inherit them from one parent. The progeny will have the mixed alleles.\nSo, the phenotypic ratio of the progeny is 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf white."}

An organism's genes, or pieces of hereditary material, are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes, or pieces of hereditary material, are passed from parents to offspring.\nGenes have two parts: the coding sequence, which contains the instructions, and the noncoding sequence, which does not contain the instructions. The noncoding sequence, or introns, are spacers that keep the coding sequences, or exons, apart.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

An organism may have a phenotype of tall plants or short plants for the tall/short trait.\nIf a gene has multiple alleles, each allele is called an allele.\nA change in an organism's genes can change an allele. For example, a point mutation is a change in an allele. A point mutation can change a base pair in a gene.\nA change in an organism's genes can also create a new allele.

When the stimulus intensity is below the threshold potential, no action potentials are generated.\nThe amplitude of the action potential is the electrical charge of an action potential. The amplitude of the action potential does not vary with the stimulus intensity.\nThe number of synapses crossed is the number of connections between nerve cells that are crossed by an action potential. This number does not vary with the stimulus intensity."}

The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell. The cytoplasm is made of a thick liquid that holds the cell's organelles, or specialized structures.\nThere are many organelles in cells. Here are some of the organelles that cells have:\nMitochondria help the cell get the energy it needs. Mitochondria break down sugars and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.\nThe nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.\nThe Golgi is an organelle made of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi helps the cell to communicate with the outside environment. The Golgi packs proteins and other substances into vesicles. Vesicles are small, bubble-like structures. Then, the Golgi releases the vesicles. The vesicles can fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside the cell.\nThe cell membrane and cytoplasm hold the cell together and control which substances enter and leave the cell. The cell membrane also protects the cell from the outside environment.\nSOLUTION: To create a cell line, scientists isolate an immortal variant cell from culture and use it to create a cell line. Cells are immortal variant cells that do not die when they grow in culture.\nImmortal variant cells are often produced by exposing cells to tumor-inducing viruses. The virus causes the cell to become immortal. It means that the cell does not die when it grows in culture.\nProducing a heterokaryon is another way to combine cells from different organisms. Heterokaryons are cells that have different types of nuclei.\nHybrid cells and inserting a tumor-inducing virus into a normal cell to initiate transformation are not techniques used to create a cell line."}

Mitochondria have their own DNA and ribosomes.\nThe mitochondria are surrounded by two membranes. The space between the two membranes is called the intermembrane space. The mitochondria matrix is the space inside the two membranes.\nAn important function of mitochondria is to manufacture ATP. Mitochondria can convert food into ATP by using the energy from food to produce an electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gradient can be used to drive some of the chemical reactions that make ATP.\nWhen mitochondria are placed in a buffered solution with a low pH, the external pH reduces the pH of the mitochondria matrix. This decrease in pH decreases the concentration of H+ ions inside the matrix. H+ ions are needed to produce ATP in the mitochondria.\nWhen there are not enough H+ ions inside the mitochondria matrix, the production of ATP slows down. The decrease in ATP production can affect the entire cell, leading to reduced cellular activity."}

The sporophyte is the part of the plant that produces spores.\nThe sporophyte is the part of the plant that grows to become the mature plant. The gametophyte is the part of the plant that produces the sex cells that can unite to form a zygote.\nIn angiosperms, the gametophyte grows first. The gametophyte produces the male and female gametes. The male gametes are produced in the anthers.

This is how plant cells can grow toward a source of water.\nSOLUTION: Plant cells grow toward a source of water. If water is touching a plant's roots, the root cells will grow into the water. As the root cells grow, they create a pressure that is stronger than the pressure inside the root. This pressure difference is what causes water to enter the root by osmosis."}

This means that the urine of a desert mammal is less concentrated than the urine of a freshwater fish. For a desert mammal, producing urine that is less concentrated than the surrounding environment is a way to get rid of excess water.\nSaltwater fish have kidneys that produce urine hyperosmotic to their tissues. This means that the urine of a saltwater fish is more concentrated than the fish's tissues. For a saltwater fish, producing urine that is more concentrated than the surrounding water is a way to get rid of waste without making the fish dehydrated.\nInsects have Malpighian tubules that allow them to excrete waste through the exoskeleton. This is possible because the outer shell of an insect is also a part of its excretory system.\nJuxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSegregation of alleles: During meiosis, homologous pairs of chromosomes separate. Each chromosome in the pair is called an allele. Offspring cells receive one allele from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, an offspring cell has a genotype of two alleles for the gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. An offspring cell has a phenotype for the trait that is a combination of the two alleles.\nFor example, a pea plant's phenotype for the flower color trait is either purple flowers or white flowers. The plant's genotype for the flower color gene is either FF, Ff, or ff.\nFrequency: Organisms, including people, have two alleles for most genes\u2014one allele inherited from each parent. These two alleles determine an organism's phenotype.\nAn allele may have one of several types, or forms, called allelic types. An organism's allelic type for an allele is called its allele type.\nSome alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with FF or Ff alleles will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with ff alleles will have white flowers.\nIndependent assortment: During meiosis, homologous pairs of chromosomes separate. After the chromosomes separate, the alleles within each pair are sorted into different cells.\nThis process is called independent assortment. Independent assortment ensures that an offspring cell receives one allele for each gene from each parent.\nSome genes do not undergo independent assortment. These genes are said to be linked.\nLinked genes are inherited as a group. An offspring cell receives one group of alleles for each linked gene.\nSOLUTION: The fruit fly genes for gray body and normal wings are linked genes. The gray-bodied, vestigial-winged fruit fly is a result of the presence of both alleles.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

All organisms are made of carbon, and the compounds that organisms make can be broken down by other organisms for food. This cycle of matter being broken down and rebuilt as different compounds is called carbon cycling.\nCarbon can come in different forms, or states, called allotropes. The three common allotropes of carbon are graphite, diamond, and graphene.\nGraphite is a soft, black, crystalline solid. It is a good electrical conductor and a poor thermal conductor. Graphite is used in pencils and as a lubricant.\nDiamond is a hard, rare, and beautiful crystalline solid. It is a good thermal conductor and a poor electrical conductor. Diamonds are used in drill bits and as gemstones.\nGraphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. It is one of the strongest and thinnest materials known. Graphene is also a good conductor of electricity and heat.\nSOLUTION: The atmosphere is the largest active pool of carbon on Earth. Over 4,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds of carbon are in the atmosphere!\nThe atmosphere is made of many different gases, and carbon is one of those gases. When organisms die, some of their carbon ends up in the atmosphere. As animals eat other organisms, they take in carbon from the atmosphere. Animals eat and breathe more carbon than plants do. So, animals have more carbon in their bodies than plants. When an animal dies, its body breaks down and the carbon goes back into the atmosphere.\nThe oceans are a large pool of carbon, but they are not the largest. The oceans hold more than 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds of carbon! But most of the carbon in the oceans is not in a form that can be used by other organisms.\nRain-forest vegetation is a small pool of carbon compared to the atmosphere and the oceans. But rain-forest vegetation is important because rain forests absorb carbon from the atmosphere. When a rain forest is cut down, the carbon in its plants and soil can release carbon into the atmosphere.\nRecoverable fossil fuels are a large pool of carbon. These fuels are made of the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Over time, the Earth's crust has pressed these remains into a solid substance. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon into the atmosphere."}

The cohesion of water molecules pulls them together.\nTension is the pull on a surface by the attractive force between two other surfaces. In the cohesion-tension theory, tension is caused by the difference in water pressure between two parts of the water column.\nAn ascent of water in the xylem begins in the roots and ends in the leaves.

For example, when a plant takes in sugars from the soil, the soil is left with a higher concentration of protons. Since the soil is outside the plant, the concentration of protons outside the plant is now lower than it is inside the plant.\nThis difference in proton concentration creates a proton gradient. The proton gradient is a source of energy that can be used by the plant.\nThe process of using a proton gradient to create energy is called chemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis was first discovered by a scientist named Peter Mitchell. For his discovery, Mitchell was awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nSOLUTION: The process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport is called loading. During loading, protons are pumped out of the phloem. This creates a proton gradient.\nThe proton gradient is then used to drive the flow of sugars out of the phloem and into the rest of the plant. This flow of sugars is called translocation."}

In early-successional plant communities, K-selected species are often dominant, as they are well-adapted to take advantage of limited resources.\nHigh detrital biomass: In early-successional plant communities, the detrital, or dead, organic matter, is a significant part of the ecosystem.\nSOLUTION: An early-successional plant community has high ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass. As primary production is the process by which organisms make their own food, this means that many different types of organisms are in the process of making their own food."}
{"question": "Which of the following is the symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fibers, phloem parenchyma, companion cell, sieve tube"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Phloem parenchyma, fibers, bundle sheath, tracheids"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, sieve tube"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bundle sheath, phloem parenchyma, companion cell, sieve tube"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Plant cells are made up of many different types of cells. One way to remember the different types of cells is to think about the functions of these cells.\nThe cells that make up the outer layers of a plant are called epidermal cells. These cells can absorb water and minerals from the soil.\nThe cells that make up the inner layers of a plant are called mesophyll cells. These cells are where photosynthesis happens.\nThe cells that make up the vascular tissue of a plant are called xylem and phloem cells. Xylem cells can transport water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. Phloem cells can transport water and nutrients from the leaves to the rest of the plant.\nSOLUTION: The symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem is:\nphotosynthesis happens in the mesophyll cells.\nthe sucrose is transported into the phloem through the symplastic pathway.\nThe companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and fibers are part of the phloem. The sieve tubes are part of the symplastic pathway.\nThe bundle sheath is part of the xylem."}
