It is used to establish a secure connection between two devices, such as a web browser and a web server.\nWhen a client and a server connect using TLS, they go through the following steps:\nThe client sends a message to the server, asking to communicate with it. This message is accompanied by a list of the secure protocols that the client supports.\nThe server responds with a message saying that it supports a secure protocol and which one it supports.\nThe client and server then exchange messages that allow them to agree on a shared session key. This process is called the handshake.\nOnce the client and server have agreed on a session key, they can use it to encrypt and decrypt all the traffic exchanged during their session.\nThe TLS handshake prevents attackers from tampering with the traffic or intercepting it.\nThere are two sides to the TLS handshake: the client side and the server side. Each side must be properly implemented to make the security promises of TLS.\nThe client side of the TLS handshake involves these steps:\nThe client sends a message to the server, announcing itself.\nThe client indicates which protocol it will use to secure the connection.\nThe client sends a message asking the server to prove that it possesses the private key that corresponds to its public key.\nThe server sends a message to the client, proving that it possesses the private key that corresponds to its public key.\nThe client and server then exchange messages that result in the client and server each knowing their shared session key.\nThe server side of the TLS handshake involves these steps:\nThe server receives a message from the client, announcing itself.\nThe server receives a message from the client, indicating which protocol the client will use to secure the connection.\nThe server receives a message from the client, asking the server to prove that it possesses the private key that corresponds to its public key.\nThe server sends a message to the client, proving that it possesses the private key that corresponds to its public key.\nThe client and server then exchange messages that result in the client and server each knowing their shared session key.\nBoth sides of the TLS handshake need to be implemented correctly to make the security promises of TLS.

It is responsible for providing end-to-end data transport. The transport layer may perform the following functions:\nThe transport layer guarantees that a set of cooperating applications can send data to each other. It is not concerned with how the applications communicate, but with getting the data from the application at one end to the application at the other end.\nAn application may have multiple endpoints, or destinations, at which it may send or receive data. Each endpoint is identified by an IP address and a port number.\nWhen an application sends data to an endpoint, the transport layer protocol receives the data and the address of the endpoint to which the data is to be sent. It then sends the data to the application at the opposite end.\nWhen an application receives a message, the transport layer protocol receives the message and the address of the endpoint from which the message was sent. It then forwards the message to the application.\nThe transport layer may use a reliable data transfer protocol, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), or an unreliable data transfer protocol, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol. This means that the application must establish a connection before sending data. The connection is maintained for the duration of the data transfer.\nTCP is a reliable protocol. It ensures that all data is sent and received without errors. It does this by sending each message twice and checking the received messages for errors.\nUDP is an unreliable protocol. It does not ensure that all data is sent and received without errors.\nAn application may use a different port number to receive data than it uses to send data. For example, a web browser may use port 80 to receive data, and port 8080 to send data. This allows multiple applications to use a single endpoint.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nUnauthorized network access is not a transport layer vulnerability. It is a network layer vulnerability.\nThe other three choices describe transport layer vulnerabilities."}

This can make it hard for local companies to compete.\nMany countries try to help their local companies compete against foreign companies. They do this by imposing trade barriers. Trade barriers are laws that make it harder for foreign companies to sell their goods in a country.\nThere are many types of trade barriers. Some common trade barriers include:\nTariffs: A tariff is a tax on a good that is imported into a country. Tariffs can make imported goods more expensive than they were before the tariff was imposed. This can make imported goods less competitive in the local market.\nQuotas: A quota is a limit on the number of a particular good that can be imported into a country. If the limit is reached, the imported good will be more expensive.\nEmbargos: An embargo is a government order that blocks imports of a good from a particular country.

There are different types of digital certificates, and each provides a different level of security.\nA digital certificate is a document that contains a public key and information about the certificate holder. When a user connects to a website, the website's server presents its digital certificate to the user's browser. The browser then uses the information in the certificate to decide whether to trust the website.\nThere are two main types of digital certificates:\nA digital certificate can be validated in several ways:\nThe browser can also check the digital certificate's signature with the issuing certificate authority.\nA digital certificate can be of different types, or classes, which include:\nA digital certificate that is valid for a few days. These are often used for testing or for temporary sites.\nA digital certificate that is valid for a few years. These are the most commonly used digital certificates.\nA digital certificate that is valid until revoked. These are often used for test environments or for sites that do not have a high security need.\nSome of the enhancements to the certificate trust model include:\nOCSP stapling: This allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate hasn't been revoked.\nTLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2: These are newer versions of the SSL/TLS protocol, which is used to encrypt a connection."}

Mutation-based fuzzing is a type of fuzzing that works by modifying a prior input to create new inputs.\nMutation-based fuzzing is based on the idea that a small change in an input can result in a completely different program path. For example, a simple change in the format string of a printf() call can cause the program to read from an invalid memory location and terminate.\nTo perform mutation-based fuzzing, one starting input is selected, and then each input is created by making one or more mutations to the original input. For example, a mutation could involve changing the format string of a printf() call to a longer or shorter string.\nThe grammar-based fuzzing is another type of fuzzing. It generates each input by following a grammar to a deep level. For example, each input could be a fully-qualified URL that conforms to the RFC 3986 standard.\nGrammar-based fuzzing can be more efficient than mutation-based fuzzing.

The sender replaces the original source IP address in the packet header with a forged IP address. The receiver then sends a response to the forged IP address, which is never heard from again.\nIP address spoofing can be used to conceal the identity of a sender and can also be used to defeat per-missions that are based on IP addresses, such as filtering and firewalling.\nSOLUTION: IP address spoofing can be detected by comparing the TTL values of the actual and spoofed addresses.\nThe Time-To-Live (TTL) field in the IP header shows the maximum number of hops that the packet is allowed to make before it is destroyed. By default, the TTL is set to 64. Each router that handles the packet decrements the TTL by 1. When the TTL is decremented to 0, the packet is destroyed and not forwarded.\nA spoofed packet is created with a TTL value that is the same as the actual packet. When the spoofed packet is forwarded, the TTL is decremented. But because the TTL is the same as the actual packet, the spoofed packet will not be destroyed when the TTL reaches 0. Instead, the packet will be forwarded to the next router.\nThe actual packet will also be forwarded to the next router. Eventually, the actual packet will have its TTL decremented to 0 and will be destroyed. But the spoofed packet will be forwarded to the next router.\nThe forwarding of the spoofed packet continues until it is no longer forwarded. At this point, the spoofed packet will not respond to the actual packet."}

This means that the child can use the parent's file descriptors to interact with files, sockets, and pipes.\nA file descriptor is an integer that identifies an open file, socket, or pipe. When a process forks, the child process uses the same file descriptors as the parent process. This means that the child process can use the parent process's file descriptors to interact with the same files, sockets, and pipes.\nSince a UNIX process can have up to 1024 file descriptors, a forked process can use its parent's file descriptors to continue using resources that the parent process had already set up.
