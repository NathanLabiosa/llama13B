This is because the flow speed tells you the rate at which fluid is moving. If the fluid flows through two or more pipes, it must flow more slowly through each pipe.\nFlow speed through a pipe is equal to the speed of the fluid multiplied by the radius of the pipe. The speed of the fluid is given by the flow speed and the distance the fluid has to move. So, the flow speed through a pipe is also equal to the flow speed divided by the distance the fluid has to move.\nIf a pipe splits into two branches, the distance the fluid has to move through each branch is half the distance it has to move through the original pipe. So, the flow speed through each branch is also equal to the flow speed divided by 2.\nIf a pipe splits into three branches, the distance the fluid has to move through each branch is one-third the distance it has to move through the original pipe. So, the flow speed through each branch is also equal to the flow speed divided by 3.\nSOLUTION: The pipe splits up into three separate paths, each with radius (Q/2). So, the distance the fluid has to move through each path is (Q/2). The flow speed through each path is equal to the flow speed of the fluid divided by the distance the fluid has to move through each path. This means the flow speed through each path is equal to the flow speed of the fluid divided by (Q/2).\nThe flow speed of the fluid is V. So, the flow speed through each path is V divided by (Q/2). This is equal to 4V/3."}

These laws say that all of the following quantities are conserved: mass, charge, momentum, and energy. This means that they are not created or destroyed in any physical or chemical change.\nThe law of conservation of mass states that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\nThe law of conservation of charge states that all physical and chemical changes conserve charge. So, the total charge before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total charge after the change.\nThe law of conservation of momentum states that all physical and chemical changes conserve momentum. So, the total momentum before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total momentum after the change.\nThe law of conservation of energy states that all physical and chemical changes conserve energy. So, the total energy before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total energy after the change.\nSOLUTION: Conservation of mass indicates that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron.\nThe mass of an electron is less than the mass of a positron. So, the combined mass of an electron and a positron is greater than the mass of either particle by itself. This mass difference comes from the combined mass of the protons and neutrons in the particles.\nBecause the positron and electron are created in the reaction, the total mass of the two particles is equal to the mass of the electron and positron before the reaction."}

The frictional force acts in the opposite direction to the object's motion.\nIf one object is moving forward and touches another object, the frictional force will act backward. This opposite direction is called the opposite of the forward direction.\nIf one object is sliding against another object, and the two objects are in contact, the frictional force will try to stop the sliding. The direction of the frictional force is from the opposite direction of the sliding direction.\nSOLUTION: The two blocks are made of the same material and have the same mass but different height and length. So, the smaller block has a larger surface area in contact with the table.\nSo, the larger frictional force is needed to make the smaller block move."}

An object in free fall falls at a constant speed, but its speed can change due to a change in the object's mass.\nAn object's mass can change when it is burning, as mass is converted from fuel (such as wood or gas) into smoke. For example, if wood is burning, its mass is being converted into smoke. As smoke, the mass of the object is lighter and has a smaller mass than the original wood.\nSo, the speed of a freely falling object changes from when it starts falling to when it lands. It starts falling with increasing speed and increasing acceleration. But as it falls, it loses some of its mass. The speed of the object then decreases and its acceleration decreases. But the object's speed will continue to decrease, and its acceleration will continue to decrease until the object lands."}

The acceleration of an object in circular motion is directed toward the center of the circle, which is called centripetal acceleration. The direction of the centripetal acceleration is opposite to the direction of the object's velocity. So, the velocity and the centripetal acceleration point in the same direction. The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is equal to the magnitude of the object's velocity.\nCentripetal force is the force that causes an object to move in a circular path. The centrifugal force is the apparent force that acts on an object in circular motion. It is directed away from the center of the circle and acts on an object as if the object were in a straight line that is perpendicular to the object's velocity. But remember that there is no true centrifugal force. It is called \"centrifugal\" because it has a direction opposite to the direction of the center of the circle.\nSOLUTION: The centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force.\nAn object undergoing uniform circular motion has both a centripetal force and a centrifugal force. These two forces act in opposite directions and are equal in magnitude. The centripetal force acts toward the center of the circle, and the centrifugal force acts away from the center of the circle.\nThe velocity of the object in motion changes whereas the acceleration of the object is constant.\nAn object's velocity changes when the object's speed changes. The speed of an object in circular motion changes as the object moves around the circle. But the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is equal to the magnitude of the object's velocity. The magnitude of an object's acceleration is equal to the magnitude of the net force acting on the object. The net force acting on an object in circular motion is equal to the centripetal force. So, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is equal to the magnitude of the change in the object's speed. The magnitude of the change in the object's speed is equal to the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration.\nA satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path.\nAn object in circular motion is not falling. An object falls when the object's speed increases. The speed of an object in circular motion changes, but the object's velocity and the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration are constant."}

So, the volume of the ideal gas is not changed during an isochoric process.\nThe temperature of the container affects the temperature of the ideal gas. But the temperature of the container is constant. So, the temperature of the ideal gas is not changed during an isochoric process.\nThe pressure of the container affects the pressure of the ideal gas. But the pressure of the container is constant. So, the pressure of the ideal gas is not changed during an isochoric process."}
{"question": "A string of fixed tension and linear mass density is attached to a vibrating speaker. It is observed that a speaker frequency of 60 Hz does not produce standing waves in the string.

For a string, the distance between two points is called the string length.\nWhen a standing wave forms, each point on the string vibrates back and forth exactly once per wave. The distance between each point that vibrates and the point below it is called the string length.\nIf the string length is a multiple of the wavelength of the wave, then each point on the string will vibrate in sync with the wave. The string will vibrate with a standing wave.\nIf the string length is not a multiple of the wavelength of the wave, then each point on the string will vibrate out of sync with the wave. The string will not vibrate with a standing wave.\nSOLUTION: The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is equal to the speed of waves on the string divided by 60 Hz.\nSince 60 Hz is in the lowest range of audible sound, the wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is too long to fit on the string. As a result, the string does not vibrate with a standing wave for the 60 Hz frequency."}

Each field line represents a line of zero thickness along which the electric field has a constant value. The density of the field lines measures the magnitude of the electric field.\nAn electric field has a positive value when the field flows outward from positive charges. An electric field has a negative value when the field flows outward from negative charges.\nSOLUTION: The electric field strength due to the charge distribution increases as r approaches infinity. This is because the charge distribution goes out to a radius R. As r gets larger than R, r approaches infinity. So, the electric field strength due to the charge distribution increases as r approaches infinity."}

An object's velocity describes its speed and direction. According to Newton's laws of motion, the acceleration of an object is determined by the forces acting on the object.\nAn object's acceleration is equal to the sum of the forces acting on the object, divided by the object's mass. If each force is represented by the symbol F, the object's acceleration a is given by:\na = F / m\nSOLUTION: The predicted velocity is 20% above the velocity measured by the photogate. This large percent difference suggests that the actual acceleration of the ball is different from the predicted acceleration.\nThe predicted acceleration of the ball is 9.8 m/s^2, which is the acceleration of gravity. But the ball's actual acceleration may be different. For example, air resistance may increase the ball's acceleration."}
