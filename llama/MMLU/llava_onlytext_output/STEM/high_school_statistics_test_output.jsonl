The null hypothesis is a statement that the outcome is not unusual.\nA hypothesis test has two parts: the null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is usually a statement of no effect, no difference, or no relationship. The alternative hypothesis is usually a statement of an effect, a difference, or a relationship.\nThe null hypothesis is declared as either \"rejected\" or \"not rejected.\" This decision is based on the evidence in the sample. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it means that the evidence in the sample is significant enough to claim an effect, a difference, or a relationship.\nSOLUTION: The statement \"If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis\" is a true statement about hypothesis testing.\nThis statement reflects the meaning of the level of significance. The level of significance is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. If the level of significance is 1%, then in 1% of the many repeated experiments, the null hypothesis will be rejected when, in fact, it is not responsible for the observed results. This is a 99% chance of making the correct decision.\nThe other three statements are false.\nWhether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided before the data are gathered. A test is one-sided or two-sided depending on the null hypothesis. For example, the null hypothesis \"this coin is fair\" is two-sided, but the null hypothesis \"this coin is weighted\" is one-sided.\nThe power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis. A test with a high power has a high ability to detect an alternative hypothesis. A test with a low power has a low ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\nA test is not \"one-sided\" or \"two-sided\" with respect to the null hypothesis. Instead, a test is one-sided or two-sided in terms of the alternative hypothesis."}

If a decrease in one set of numbers is always associated with a decrease in the other set of numbers, then the two sets of numbers are negatively correlated.\nIf an increase in one set of numbers is sometimes associated with a decrease in the other set of numbers, and other times associated with an increase, then the two sets of numbers are not correlated.\nIn this case, the second exam is 10 hours longer than the first exam. So, the two sets of numbers change together. One hour more studying for the second exam is always followed by one hour more studying for the first exam.\nSo, the correlation between the numbers of hours students studied for each exam is 1."}

{"question": "A study was conducted to test a new style of keyboard in preventing repetitive stress disorders. Volunteers who have had problems with such injuries were randomly assigned to use either a traditional keyboard or the new design.

When conducting a hypothesis test, you need to decide how to set up the test and what the result means. One way to do this is by performing a significance test.\nA significance test is a test of the signal in a set of data. The test determines whether the data are likely to have occurred by chance.\nThere are many different significance tests. When you perform a significance test, you need to set up the test with a specific null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the assertion that the data occur by chance. The alternative hypothesis is the assertion that the data do not occur by chance.\nThe null hypothesis is tested by calculating a probability value, or P-value. The P-value is the probability of getting the observed data, or more extreme data, if the null hypothesis is true.\nA P-value of less than 0.05 is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is strong evidence to claim that the alternative hypothesis is true.\nA P-value of greater than or equal to 0.05 is evidence to accept the null hypothesis. This means that there is not enough evidence to claim that the alternative hypothesis is true.\nSOLUTION: The P-value is 0.07. This means that there is a 7% chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the new keyboard is really no better at preventing injuries.\nThe null hypothesis should be accepted."}

When designing an experiment, you must identify the parts of the experiment that are likely to affect the results. These parts are called variables.\nThere are two types of variables in experiments: independent variables and dependent variables.\nThe independent variable is the part of the experiment that is different or changed. It is usually the part of the experiment that is tested or measured during the investigation.\nThe dependent variable is the part of the experiment that is measured or observed. It is usually the part of the experiment that is affected by the independent variable.\nRandomization is the process of assigning subjects to groups in an experiment. Randomization is important because it helps ensure that there are no differences between the groups other than the variable that is being tested.\nFor example, suppose you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what type of soil to use for each plant? One way to decide is to assign each plant to a type of soil.\nBut what if one type of soil is missing? You could assign plants to different types of soil using a randomization process. This process involves taking things out of their ordinary order. For example, you could start by assigning a random soil type to the first plant, and then move on to the next plant, assigning a random soil type to that plant, and so on.\nControl of confounding variables means to account for any other variables that might affect the results. These variables are called confounding variables.\nFor example, in the experiment above, if one type of soil is richer than the other types of soil, then soil type is a confounding variable. The rich soil might make the plants in that soil taller than the plants in the other soil.\nYou can control confounding variables by making sure that all of the plants in each experiment are the same. For example, in the experiment above, you can control confounding variables by using plants of the same age, height, and species in each type of soil.\nUse of a confounding variable to control the placebo effect means to use a substance or situation that is made up or different in some way. This substance or situation is called a confounding variable.\nThe placebo effect is what happens when people get better because they take a medicine that does not contain any medicine. In some experiments, the placebo effect can affect the results. For example, if one group of people in an experiment takes a placebo medicine and the other group takes a real medicine, the group that takes the placebo medicine might get better. This is because the group that takes the placebo medicine is expecting to get better!\nTo control the placebo effect, you can use a real medicine in one group of the experiment and a placebo in the other group.\nReplication of the experiment using sufficient numbers of subjects means to run the experiment again with a different group of people.\nReplication can show whether the results of the experiment were a fluke. If the results are the same in the second experiment, then the results of the first experiment are probably accurate."}

A sample proportion is a fraction. It is a estimate of the true proportion, which is represented by the symbol P.\nP = number of successes / total number of observations\n2. To calculate the margin of error of a sample proportion, use the following formula:\nmargin of error = M / (n + M)\nwhere M is the maximum possible value of the sample proportion, and n is the number of observations.\nFor example, the maximum possible value of a sample proportion is M = 0.5. The margin of error is calculated as follows:\nmargin of error = 0.5 / (10 + 0.5) = 0.05\n3. The margin of error shows how much the sample proportion is likely to differ from the true proportion.\nIf the margin of error is 0.05, then the sample proportion is 0.5 \u00b1 0.05. This means that the proportion is estimated to be 50% \u00b1 5%.\n4.

The normal distribution is a symmetric distribution with a bell-shaped curve. The curve is symmetric about the mean, and the peak of the curve is at the mean.\nThe normal distribution is described by two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation. The mean is the center of the distribution, and the standard deviation is the spread of the distribution.\nThe standard deviation is also used to define the intervals into which the interval is divided. The mean is in the center of the distribution. The interval from the mean to the mean + standard deviation is called the normal interval. There are 6 standard deviations with a mean of 0.\nThis normal interval has a width of the standard deviation. The height of the bell-shaped curve is one over the standard deviation squared.\nSo, the area under the curve is one half. This means that the normal distribution is symmetrical about the mean.\nBecause the normal distribution is bell-shaped, it is often used to approximate the distribution of a variety of statistical quantities. For example, the normal distribution is a good approximation of the distribution of:\nthe weight of a newborn baby\nthe distance a ball travels from a certain type of throw\nthe time it takes for a worker to finish a task\nIn general, the normal distribution is a good approximation when the values are repeated measurements and have a known standard deviation.\nSOLUTION: To find the interval that contains the middle 80% of the durations, you need to find the interval that contains the middle 80% of the values.\nFirst, you need to find the standard deviation.\nThe standard deviation is 76 minutes.\nNext, you need to find the mean.\nThe mean is 167 minutes.\nThen, you need to decide which interval contains the middle 80% of the values.\nTo do this, look at the range of values and the standard deviation.

In many countries, employment is stiffer than ever. This change has forced workers to be more flexible. Companies have had to find ways to keep costs down, and they have done this by using temp agencies, part-time workers, and contract workers.\nAs a result of these changes, the traditional job has been replaced by a variety of work situations. Some people may have several part-time jobs in a single year. Others may work as independent contractors. Still, others may work as temps.\nMany people find that a job is not for life. They may start a job with the expectation of staying for a short time. This is not unusual. Many people find permanent work after starting in a temporary or part-time position.\nSOLUTION: The employment agency knows that 20% of the workers they place will not still be at the place of employment after one year. So, out of the 100 workers hired by the employer at the start of the first year, only 80 of these workers will still be at their place of employment after one year.\nAt the start of the second year, the employer hires 100 more workers. Of these workers, only 5% are expected to leave their job within the next year.

The t-distribution is used when the variance of the population is unknown and has to be estimated from the sample.\nThe t-distribution is defined by two parameters: the degree of freedom (df) and the value of the t-distribution at the mean (the t-score). The degree of freedom is the number of scores in the sample minus one.\nFor a given t-score, the t-distribution is higher at the tails than the normal distribution. This means that the tail values of the t-distribution are more spread out than the tail values of the normal distribution.\nFor example, the 99.7% value of the normal distribution is 2.576. The 99.7% value of the t-distribution is 4.076. This means that, for a t-distribution with 1 degree of freedom, the tail value is 1.5 times as far from the mean as the tail value of a normal distribution with the same mean and 1 degree of freedom.\nThe t-distribution has the following properties:\nFor each df, the t-distribution is symmetric.\nThe t-distribution is lower at the mean than the normal distribution.\nThe greater the df, the closer the t-distribution is to the normal distribution.\nThe smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models.\nThe 68-95-99.7 Rule is a quick way to use the t-distribution to estimate probabilities.

A confounding variable is a variable that affects both the population means and the assignment of subjects to groups.\nIf confounding variables are not taken into account, the comparisons between the means of the two populations may be invalid.\nFor example, consider an experiment in which one group of students is given a new study guide, and the other group uses the old study guide. The assignment of students to groups is not random. This lack of random assignment may affect the mean test scores of each group.\nThe non-random assignment of students to groups has caused a confounding variable. Because this confounding variable affects both the population means and the assignment of subjects to groups, it is important to use the right statistical test that takes into account this confounding variable.\nOne way to take into account a confounding variable is to use a matched pairs comparison. In a matched pairs comparison, each group is matched on the confounding variable.\nIf the two populations are not matched on the confounding variable, you can use the independent samples comparison. This test assumes that the populations are equal on the confounding variable.\nAn example of a confounding variable is the age of the population.

A sample is a group of individuals who are selected from a larger group.\nSampling is a necessary step in research because it is usually not possible to study every individual in a population. Additionally, studying a sample can provide information about the population as a whole.\nThere are several ways to choose individuals for a sample. The method you choose will depend on the type of research you are doing and the size of the population.\nConvenience sample: A convenience sample is a group of individuals who are selected because they are easily available. This method is often used in casual research.\nConvenience samples can be selected quickly and easily. However, this method may not include a representative cross-section of the population.\nFor example, a convenience sample of 15 customers who visit a fast-food restaurant may include only those customers who are hungry and visit the restaurant promptly. These customers may be younger and have more money than the average customer.\nOversampling: Oversampling is the process of including a larger-than-expected number of individuals from a particular subgroup in a sample.\nOversampling can help to increase the representation of a subgroup in a sample.\nFor example, if a researcher wants to study the reading habits of children, the researcher may oversample children who are frequent library users.\nSimple random sample: A simple random sample is a group of individuals who are selected at random. This method ensures that all individuals in the population have an equal chance of being selected for the sample.\nTo form a simple random sample, put the population into alphabetical order and then select individuals at random from the list.\nFor example, to study the reading habits of high school students, put the high school students in alphabetical order by last name and then select 32 students at random from the list.\nStratified sample: A stratified sample is a group of individuals who are selected based on their subgroup membership. This method is often used when subgroups in a population have different characteristics.\nTo form a stratified sample, divide the population by its subgroups and then select individuals from each subgroup.\nFor example, to study the reading habits of high school students, put the high school students into groups by grade level and then select a certain number of students from each grade level.\nSystematic sample: A systematic sample is a group of individuals who are selected at regular intervals. This method is often used when it is necessary to examine a representative sample of a population that is too large to examine all at once.\nTo form a systematic sample, identify a starting point and select individuals at regular intervals.\nFor example, to study the reading habits of high school students, start with the first high school student in the alphabetical list and select students every 15th person."}

The confidence interval is calculated using the following five pieces of information: the sample size, the upper and lower values of the sample, and the level of confidence.\nA sample is a group of adult baboons from which information is collected. The size of the sample is called the sample size.\nThe upper and lower values of the sample are the highest and lowest values in the group.\nThe level of confidence is the tolerance for error that is acceptable for the interval. A 95% confidence interval has a 95% level of confidence, which means that the calculated interval is expected to be within 2.5% of the true average height. If the calculated interval is within 2.5% of the true average height, then the caller can be 95% confident that the true average height is within the interval.\nSOLUTION: To calculate the minimum sample size needed to achieve a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 2.5%, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Find the z score that corresponds to a margin of error of 2.5%. The margin of error is 2.5%, so the z score is 2.5%.\nStep 2: Use the formula for a 95% confidence interval to find the minimum sample size: n = (Z^2/E^2) + (Z/E).\nSubstitute the values for Z and E:\nn = (2.5^2 / 2.5^2) + (2.5 / 2.5) = 1.\nSo, the minimum sample size needed to achieve a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 2.5% is 1."}

When the point is removed, the new slope is -1.04 and the new correlation coefficient is -0.95. What name is given to a point whose removal has this kind of effect on statistical calculations?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Outlier"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Statistically significant point"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Point of discontinuity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Influential point"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "LECTURE: A point is a statistical outlier if it is a point whose value is much higher or lower than the other values in the data set. Outliers can have a large influence on the results of statistical calculations.\nA point is a statistical leader if it is a point whose value is much higher than the other values in the data set. LeCTURE: A point is a statistical leader if it is a point whose value is much higher than the other values in the data set. Leaders have a large influence on the results of statistical calculations.\nA point is a statistical non-outlier if it is not a statistical outlier.\nA point is a statistical non-leader if it is not a statistical leader.\nA point is a point of discontinuity if it is a point that is removed, and the new slope of the regression line is more than 0.10 different from the old slope.\nA point is a statistically significant point if its removal has a large effect on the results of the statistical calculation. This effect is called a large influence. A point has a large influence if either of the following is true:\nThe point is a statistical outlier.\nThe point is a statistical leader.\nSOLUTION: The point (15,2) is a statistical non-outlier and a statistical non-leader. Its removal has a large influence on the results of the statistical calculation. So, the point is an influential point."}
