Electronic spin is a property of electrons that arises from their spin. Like all forms of spin, electronic spin is a quantum property, which means that it has certain properties called quantum numbers.\nThe most important quantum number for electronic spin is the spin number. For the electron, the spin number can be up or down. These two spin numbers are represented as \u00b1.\nAn electron with spin number \u00b11/2 is a spin 1/2 electron.\nSome molecules, such as O2, have one spin 1/2 electron. Other molecules, such as O2-, have two spin 1/2 electrons.\nThe type of electronic bond between two atoms in a molecule determines the spin numbers of the electrons in the bond. For some bonds, the electrons are spin 1/2 electrons. For other bonds, the electrons are spin 3/2 electrons.\nThe spectrum of an EPR experiment shows how the spin numbers of the electrons in a molecule affect the EPR signal. The spectrum has a certain number of lines.\nThe number of lines in the spectrum is called the multiplicity. The multiplicity can be 1, 3, 5, or 7.\nThe multiplicity of an EPR spectrum is determined by the electronic structure of the molecule. The electronic structure is a way of describing the bonds between atoms in a molecule.\nIf a molecule has a single bond between two atoms, the bond will form a spin 1/2 electron. The multiplicity of the EPR spectrum is 1.\nIf a molecule has a double bond between two atoms, the bond will form two spin 1/2 electrons. The multiplicity of the EPR spectrum is 3.\nIf a molecule has a triple bond between two atoms, the bond will form three spin 1/2 electrons. The multiplicity of the EPR spectrum is 5.\nIf a molecule has a quadruple bond between two atoms, the bond will form four spin 1/2 electrons. The multiplicity of the EPR spectrum is 7.\nSOLUTION: The nitronyl nitroxide diradical has two equivalent nitrogen nuclei. So, the unpaired electron is coupled to two equivalent nuclei. This means that the electronic structure of the molecule is a rigid diradical.\nThe electronic structure of a rigid diradical has a multiplicity of 3 in the EPR spectrum."}

When an electron is absorbed, its energy is increased. The absorbed electron can move to a higher energy level, or orbit, in the atom or molecule.\nWhen an electron moves to a higher energy level, it is said to have been excited. The atom or molecule is now in an excited state.\nAn excited atom or molecule can return to a lower energy level by emitting an electron. When an electron is emitted, its energy is decreased. The emitted electron moves to a lower energy level in the atom or molecule.\nIn an EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectrum, the line intensities indicate the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number of atoms in the ground state. The line intensities can be used to determine the ratio of the number of electrons in the excited state to the number of electrons in the ground state.\nSOLUTION: To determine the ratio of line intensities in the EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical, look at the line intensities and calculate the ratios.\nThe line intensities are 1:19:36:84:126:126:84:36:19:1.\nFirst, find the common factors for each ratio. The common factors are 1, 9, and 19. The highest common factor is 19.\nSo, the ratio of line intensities is 1:9:36.\nTo find the ratio of the number of electrons in the excited state to the number of electrons in the ground state, divide the line intensity of the excited state by the line intensity of the ground state.

The chemical shift can be affected by the nucleus's surroundings. Therefore, the chemical shift of a nucleus in a molecule can tell you about the surroundings of the nucleus.\nFor example, the chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in a molecule can tell you about the chemical environment of the hydrogen atom. An atom in an aromatic molecule has a 1H chemical shift of about 7 ppm, whereas an atom in an aliphatic molecule has a 1H chemical shift of about 4 to 7 ppm.\nSOLUTION: The 31P chemical shift of H2PO4\u203e is 3.42 ppm. The 31P chemical shift of HPO42\u2013 is 5.82 ppm. The pKa of H2PO4\u203e is less than the pH of the solution.

The magnitude of nuclear binding energy is determined by the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\nAn atom is made of three parts: the nucleus, which is made of protons and neutrons; the electron cloud, which is made of electrons; and the nucleus, which is made of protons and neutrons.\nThe protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other. This attraction is called the nuclear force. The magnitude of the nuclear force is determined by the distance between the protons and neutrons.\nThe nuclear binding energy is equal to the mass of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus minus the mass of the electrons.\nSOLUTION: The first statement is not true. Binding energy per nucleon reaches a maximum for 56Fe. means that for each nucleon in the nucleus of an atom, the maximum binding energy is reached in 56Fe.\nThe second statement is true. Nuclear binding energies have about the same magnitude as chemical bond energies. means that the magnitude of nuclear binding energy is about the same as the magnitude of the bond energy that holds two atoms together.\nThe third statement is true. Nuclei have slightly less mass than the sum of their component nucleons. means that the nucleus of an atom has slightly less mass than the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\nThis is because the protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force.

The result is a solution that contains a known amount of the substance.\nStandard solutions are used to calibrate the equipment that is used to measure the substance. For example, a standard solution can be used to calibrate a pH meter. The pH meter will give a reading that is equal to the pH of the standard solution.\nSOLUTION: To determine a primary standard for use in standardizing bases, look for a substance whose molecule contains a hydroxide ion. A hydroxide ion is a molecule that is made of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms.\nPotassium hydroxide is made of one potassium atom and one hydroxide ion. It can be used as a primary standard for standardizing bases.\nSodium hydroxide is made of one sodium atom and one hydroxide ion. It can also be used as a primary standard for standardizing bases.\nAmmonium hydroxide is made of one ammonium atom and one hydroxide ion. It is a secondary standard for standardizing bases. It is made by mixing equal volumes of ammonia and a 2.5% solutio#Assistant: LECTURE: When one substance is mixed with another substance, their volumes must be in the same units. For example, if one substance is mixed with another substance, the units of the volume of the first substance must be the same as the units of the volume of the second substance.\nIf the volumes are in different units, they must be converted to the same units before they are mixed.\nFor example, if you want to mix 500 milliliters of a substance with 250 milliliters of a different substance, the units of the volume are not the same. There are 100 milliliters in 1 liter. So, the 500 milliliters and the 250 milliliters must be converted to liters before they can be mixed.\nTo convert 500 milliliters to liters, use the following formula:\n500 milliliters \u00d7 (1 milliliter / 500 milliliters) = 1 liter\nTo convert 250 milliliters to liters, use the following formula:\n250 milliliters \u00d7 (1 milliliter / 250 milliliters) = 1 liter\nNow the volumes are in the same units. They can be mixed.\nSOLUTION: To use potassium hydroxide as a primary standard for standardizing bases, first prepare a 1 molar solution of potassium hydroxide. To do this, add 1 mole of potassium hydroxide to 1 liter of solvent.\nA mole is a measurement of the quantity of a substance. One mole of potassium hydroxide is 6.25 grams of potassium hydroxide.\nTo prepare the solute, measure out 6.25 grams of potassium hydroxide.\nTo prepare the solvent, place 1 liter of solvent in a clean container.\nMix the solute and solvent together. The resulting solution has a concentration of 1 molar.\nNow you can use this 1 molar solution to standardize bases. To do this, add a sample of a base to the 1 molar solution. The sample of the base will interact with the hydroxide ions in the solute. This will change the concentration of the solute in the solution.\nThe concentration of the solute in the solution is now equal to the concentration of the base in the sample. For example, if the sample of the base is 25% hydroxide ions, then the concentration of the solute in the solution is also 25%.\nTo use the solution to determine the base in a sample, dilute the solution with more solvent to obtain a solution with a known concentration. For example, to make a 0.1 molar solution, mix 1 milliliter of the 1 molar solution with 9 milliliters of solvent.\nThen, add the diluted solution to the sample of the base. The concentration of the solute in the diluted solution is equal to the concentration of the base in the sample. So, the concentration of the base in the sample can be determined.\nSOLUTION: Sulfuric acid and acetic acid are not primary standards for standardizing bases.\nSulfuric acid is made of one sulfur"}
