The spread is called the standard deviation.\nThe standard deviation gives you a sense of how spread out the data are. A small standard deviation means that the data are clustered around the mean. A large standard deviation means that the data are scattered in all directions.\nThe standard deviation is written in the same way as the variable it describes. For the variable x, the standard deviation is written as \u03c3x.\nWhen you are given the mean and standard deviation of a quantity, you can write an equation to describe that quantity.\nFor example, if you are given the mean and standard deviation of a variable x, you can write:\nx \u00b5x \u00b1 \u03c3x\nThis means that the average value of x is \u00b5x, and the spread of x is \u03c3x.\nSOLUTION: The average number of photons detected by the photon detector is 10, with a standard deviation of about 3.\nThis means that the average number of photons detected is 10, and the spread of the number of photons detected is about 3."}

The refractive index of a material is a measure of how much the material bends light. A material's refractive index can be greater than, less than, or equal to 1.\nIf the refractive index of a material is greater than 1, the material is said to be more dense. Light bends into the more dense material.\nIf the refractive index of a material is less than 1, the material is said to be less dense. Light bends out of the less dense material.\nIf the refractive index of a material is equal to 1, the material is said to be the same density as the surrounding material. Light bends very little, if at all, when it enters or leaves the material.\nThe boundary between two materials does not have to be a sharp edge.

When atoms and molecules absorb radiation, they can change their energy levels. The amount of radiation absorbed depends on the type of matter. By studying how much radiation is absorbed, scientists can learn about the types of matter.\nSodium looks yellow to the naked eye. But if you look at sodium through a prism, you will notice that it absorbs more infrared radiation than it does visible radiation. This is because sodium is a higher-energy atom than other types of atoms.\nExperiments with different types of matter can be designed to isolate the effects of different types of radiation. For example, if you want to learn about how different types of matter absorb visible radiation, you can do the following experiment:\n1. Use a beam of visible light to shine through a sample of the matter.\n2. Use a prism to split the beam of light into its individual wavelengths.\n3. Count the amount of radiation absorbed by the sample for each wavelength.\nThe type of laser you use to perform this experiment will affect your results. Different types of lasers produce light beams with different wavelengths.\nSOLUTION: A ruby laser produces light in the visible spectrum.

The conductivity of a semiconductor is determined by the mobilty of its charge carriers\u2014electrons and holes.\nDoping a semiconductor means adding impurities to the semiconductor. The impurities can act as either electrons or holes.\nWhen an impurity atom is added to a semiconductor, it will usually bond with one of the semiconductor atoms. This bonding can leave one of the semiconductor atoms with an open space for an electron. The open space becomes a place where an electron can live.\nAn electron is a charge carrier. It has a negative charge.\nA hole is a place where an electron can live. It has a positive charge.\nThe sign of the charge carrier in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring its conductivity.\nIf the impurities in a semiconductor are electrons, then the semiconductor is negatively doped.\nIf the impurities in a semiconductor are holes, then the semiconductor is positively doped.\nSOLUTION: The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring its Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a property that depends on the type of charge carriers in a substance."}

But, an observer on the train can see the track's width as only 5.50 yards!

It needs a medium to travel through. Sound can travel through air, water, and solid matter.\nSound waves are made up of frequencies and wavelengths. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz).

When unpolarized light passes through a linear polarizer, the light that is polarized perpendicular to the filter is blocked, and the light that is polarized parallel to the filter is transmitted.\nThe percent of incident light that is transmitted through a linear polarizer is called the transmission coefficient. The transmission coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:\nT = 1 - (1 - P) \\* (1 - R)\nwhere P is the polarization of the incident light, and R is the polarization of the transmitted light. If P is P and R is R, then T is the transmission coefficient.\nSOLUTION: First, find the polarization of the transmitted light. Since the transmission axes make an angle of 45\u00b0 with each other, the transmitted light is linearly polarized at a 45\u00b0 angle between the two transmission axes. So, R is 45\u00b0.\nSecond, find the polarization of the incident light. Since the polarizers are unpolarized, the incident light is linearly polarized at every angle. So, P is 180\u00b0.\nThird, calculate the transmission coefficient.\nT = 1 - (1 - P) \\* (1 - R)\nT = 1 - (1 - 180\u00b0) \\* (1 - 45\u00b0)\nT = 1 - (195\u00b0)\nT = 45\u00b0\nFourth, calculate the percent of the incident light that is transmitted.\nThe transmitted light is 45% of the incident light."}

This narrow line width is the reason the lines in an emission spectrum are not immediately visible.
