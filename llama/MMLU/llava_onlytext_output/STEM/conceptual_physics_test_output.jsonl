Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If the direction of a force is parallel to an object's horizontal axis, the force is a horizontal force. If the direction of a force is parallel to the object's vertical axis, the force is a vertical force.\nThe magnitude of a force refers to the strength of the force. A force's magnitude can be described as its size.\nSOLUTION: The 10-N force at an angle 45\u00b0 above the horizontal has a horizontal component. The magnitude of the horizontal component is the magnitude of the force times the cosine of the angle between the force and the horizontal.\nMagnitude = force \u00d7 cos 45\u00b0\nMagnitude = 10 N \u00d7 cos 45\u00b0\nMagnitude = 10 N \u00d7 (1/2)\nMagnitude = 5 N"}

For example, wood and water are both made of matter, but wood is much more dense than water. A wooden block has a higher density than an equal-sized cube of water.\nDensity is also important for determining how much space an object takes up. As matter is added to or removed from an object, its volume changes. An object's density tells you how much the object weighs for a given volume.\nSOLUTION: A completely submerged object is under water. So, the object is displacing water and is also being weighed down by the water."}

When light passes from one substance to another substance, the light is refracted, or bent. This bending is caused by a change in the substance's optical density. The optical density of a substance is a measure of the substance's ability to refract light.\nThe optical density of air is much less than that of water. So, when light passes from water to air, the light is refracted away from the normal. The amount of bending is determined by the angle of the surface of the water compared to the surface of the air.\nWhen a diver points a flashlight upward toward the surface of the water at an angle of 20\u00b0 from the normal, the beam of light passes into the air above the water. The angle of the beam of light is larger than the angle of the surface of the water compared to the surface of the air. So, the light does not totally internally reflect. The light does not get absorbed by the water, and it is not visible to the diver."}

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas.\nSOLUTION: When you squeeze an air-filled party balloon, you increase its volume, but you do not change its mass. So, the balloon's weight does not change.\nThe balloon is made of a special type of matter called a plastic. This type of matter is called a polymer.\nA plastic is a solid. But a plastic is so pliable, or soft, that it can be stretched and shaped into many different forms.\nDensity is the ratio of a matter's mass to its volume.

The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break.

When two magnets attract or repel each other, they are exerting magnetic forces on each other.\nMagnetic forces are created by the movement of electric charges. But not all magnets have electric charges. So, magnetic forces are created by the movement of magnets.\nWhen magnets move, they create a magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field is determined by the movement of the magnets. The magnetic field is so strong that it can pull on magnets that are far away.\nThe direction of the magnetic field is created by the movement of the magnets.

The troughs of one wave line up with the troughs of the other wave. The waves cancel each other out, and the result is a wave with a lower amplitude.\nA wave is said to move slower than the source producing it when the wave is slower to leave the source than the source is producing it. This can happen with waves of light.\nA wave is said to be moving faster than the source producing it when the wave is faster to leave the source than the source is producing it. This can happen with waves of sound.\nSOLUTION: A shock wave is produced by a wave of sound. A sound wave is a type of wave made of matter.

For example, the direction magnitude of a charge determines the direction of the force it exerts on other charges.\nSOLUTION: When you brush your hair and scrape electrons from your hair, the charge of your hair becomes negative.\nThe hairs on your head are made of a material that is rich in hydrogen. These hydrogen atoms have electrons. When the electrons are knocked off, the atoms become positively charged. The positively charged atoms attract the negatively charged electrons. This process leaves your hair with a negative charge magnitude."}

Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One distance is used to describe how far an object has moved relative to a different position. This distance is called the displacement.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One time is used to describe how long an object has spent in a different speed. This time is called the proper time.\nSOLUTION: The formula for relativistic momentum is p = m u, where p is the momentum, m is the mass, and u is the velocity.\nThe formula for relativistic energy is E = m u, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and u is the velocity.\nBoth of these formulas show that mass and distance are not affected by relativistic speeds. Instead, the mass increases and the distance decreases.\nSo, relativistic equations for time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic momentum and energy hold true at all speeds."}

This means that they are connected. Some things in space can change the way we experience time. For example, a person in a fast-moving spacecraft will experience time differently than a person on Earth. But the basic rules of space and time have not changed.\nEinstein showed that space and time are also related to mass and acceleration. In other words, what happens to the mass of an object affects the space and time that the object experiences. For example, the faster a clock moves, the slower it will tick. This is called the twin paradox. One twin stays on Earth. The other twin flies around the Earth in a spacecraft. When the twins meet again, the twin who flew is younger than the twin who stayed behind.\nSOLUTION: Einstein discovered that space and time are separate entities. They are not part of one whole.
