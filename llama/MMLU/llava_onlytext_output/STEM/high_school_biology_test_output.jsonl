These changes would change the gene's message. This change would likely have the greatest deleterious effect, as the new codon would probably produce a different protein, or not at all, since the new codon would be out of the possible four nucleotides.\nA deletion of a nucleotide triplet would remove three nucleotides from the mRNA, which would change the last two codons.

An organism's phenotype is the result of its combination of genes. An organism's genes are passed from parents to offspring.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nAn organism's fitness is its ability to survive and reproduce. Fitness depends on an organism's combination of traits.\nSOLUTION: The coat pattern that is associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive in a hypothetical environment. This coat pattern is associated with crossed eyes because the same gene affects both coat pattern and crossed eyes. This shows that the two traits are connected.\nHowever, the cross-eyed condition is slightly maladaptive. This means that the genotype for the crossed eyes trait is a compromise between two alleles. The allele for crossed eyes is for the cross-eyed condition. The other allele is for normal eyes.\nThis example shows that phenotype is often the result of compromise. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of alleles for that trait. An organism's alleles may have types called dominant and recessive. Dominant alleles cause their version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has recessive alleles for the gene. Recessive alleles cause their version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene.\nIn pea plants, the F allele, which is for purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with FF or FF will have purple flowers.\nA pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with ff will have white flowers.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.\nAn organism's fitness is its ability to survive and reproduce. Fitness depends on an organism's combination of traits.\nSOLUTION: The coat pattern that is associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive in a hypothetical environment. This coat pattern is associated with crossed eyes because the same gene affects both coat pattern and crossed eyes. This shows that the two traits are connected.\nHowever, the cross-eyed condition is slightly maladaptive. This means that the genotype for the crossed eyes trait is a compromise between two alleles. The allele for crossed eyes is for the cross-eyed condition. The other allele is for normal eyes.\nThis example shows that natural selection tends to reduce the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time. A maladaptive gene is a gene that has a combination of alleles that is slightly harmful to the organism. These alleles reduce the organism's fitness.\nA maladaptive gene may be slightly harmful to the organism, but it may also have some benefits. For example, a gene with alleles for both blue flowers and good immunity may have some benefits. An organism with at least one allele for good immunity will have a higher fitness level than an organism with no alleles for good immunity.\nIf a maladaptive gene is connected to another gene that has a combination of alleles that is highly beneficial to"}

This increases the amount of oxygen available to the body's cells.\nThe urinary system works to maintain a stable internal environment by balancing the amount of water in the body. When the body gains water, the kidneys usually produce more urine. This adds to the water that is excreted from the body. When the body loses water, the kidneys produce less urine. This helps to conserve water in the body.\nIn each of these systems, a number of events occur in response to a change in the environment. These events are known as the feedback mechanism.\nThe feedback mechanism is a series of events that happens after an event in the environment. The response helps to restore the environment to its original state.\nFor example, when the body's temperature rises, the skin's blood vessels dilate. This allows heat to be released into the environment. The dilation of the blood vessels increases the surface area of the blood vessels. This higher surface area allows more heat to be released into the environment.\nThis increase in the surface area of the blood vessels is the response to the change in the environment. It is a part of the feedback mechanism.\nSOLUTION: ADH is a hormone that helps to conserve water in the body. When the body is dehydrated, the kidneys release ADH. This causes the liver to release a hormone called vasopressin. Vasopressin reduces the amount of water that is excreted in the urine.\nThis response to dehydration is an example of a positive feedback mechanism. When the body is dehydrated, ADH is released. The release of ADH increases the amount of vasopressin in the body. Vasopressin, in turn, reduces the amount of water that is excreted in the urine. This decrease in the amount of water excreted in the urine helps to conserve water in the body."}

Chromosomes can be either inherited or acquired. Inherited and acquired chromosomes have different types.\nInherited chromosomes: Inherited chromosomes are passed down through families. Children get their inherited chromosomes from their parents. Inherited chromosomes do not need to be learned.\nAcquired chromosomes: Acquired chromosomes are gained during a person's life. Some acquired chromosomes, such as those involved in mitosis, are gained before birth. Other acquired chromosomes, such as those involved in bacterial infections, are gained after birth.\nThe sex chromosomes are a type of chromosome. Most people have two sex chromosomes. One sex chromosome is inherited from each parent.\nMen have a single sex chromosome (an X or a Y).\nWomen have two sex chromosomes (one X and one Y).\nThe sex chromosomes are different from the other chromosomes. They do not have all of the genes that are needed for body function. Instead, the sex chromosomes have genes that influence sex and reproductive organs.\nThe Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome. After a female is born, one of her X chromosomes is inactivated. This happens randomly. The inactivation happens in cells that form the placenta. As a result, the placenta has one active X chromosome and one inactive X chromosome. The rest of the woman's cells have one active X chromosome and one inactive X chromosome.\nBecause the Barr body is not able to contribute genes to a woman's offspring, the Barr body is not passed down through families. This means that the Barr body is not a part of a woman's inherited chromosomes.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nThe Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome. It results in females who are sterile. But most women have one active X chromosome. So, these women are not sterile.\nThe other answer choices are not correct.\nAn inactivated Y chromosome results in a man being sterile. But the Y chromosome does not become a Barr body.\nA person who has a Barr body appears female. But a Barr body is not an inactivated Y chromosome."}

These reactions are called metabolic reactions. During metabolic reactions, cells use energy to break down molecules and build new ones.\nOne type of metabolic reaction is glycolysis. It is the breakdown of glucose.\nGlycolysis begins when a cell takes in glucose. The glucose comes into the cell from the blood.\nThe first step of glycolysis requires the glucose to bond with the cell. This bond is called a lock. The lock keeps the glucose from being broken down until the cell is ready.\nThe cell uses energy from the lock to help move the glucose into the cell. The glucose is now ready to be broken down.\nThe breakdown of glucose during glycolysis releases energy that the cell can use. The release of energy is shown by the arrows in the diagram.\nThe reactants of glycolysis are converted into two products: pyruvate and ATP.\nATP is a molecule that cells use to store and release energy. When pyruvate is converted into ATP, the cell has more energy.\nThe products of glycolysis, pyruvate and ATP, are shown in the diagram in blue.\nSOLUTION: During glycolysis, NAD+ and H+ and 2e- are produced. These are shown in blue.\nDuring fermentation, NAD+ and H+ and 2e- are consumed. These are shown in yellow.\nSo, the reaction that occurs during glycolysis but during fermentation is the reverse of the reaction shown in blue.\nThe reverse of the reaction shown in blue is the reaction pyruvate \u2192 ethanol. This reaction is shown in yellow."}

Vestigial organs are common in many organisms, including people.\nThe thymus is a vestigial organ in people. It is located in the chest, near the heart. The thymus is important in the development of the immune system. But by the time a person reaches adulthood, the thymus is much smaller and produces only 5% of the hormones it did before.\nThe appendix is a vestigial organ in people.

They are made up of many different types of molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. These molecules are involved in many different cellular processes.\nOne way that cells can differ from each other is by having different types of molecules. For example, cells that make up the muscles in an organism have molecules that allow them to contract.\nAnother way that cells can differ from each other is by having different sizes. The size of a cell affects where it fits in an organism.\nSmaller cells are usually found in organs that require a high level of detail. For example, the cells of the eye must be able to detect small changes in light.\nLarger cells are usually found in organs that require less detail. For example, the cells of the heart must be able to contract and expand regularly.\nSOLUTION: Most animal cells are small and about the same size. One reason for this is that smaller cells avoid excessive osmosis and subsequent lysis. Osmosis is the movement of water into a cell. When a cell takes in too much water, it may burst! Animals can use their cells to control how much water they take in. But most animal cells are too small to control the amount of osmosis that happens."}

These changes can lead to new alleles.\nTranslocations and mistakes in meiosis can produce offspring with different combinations of genes. These events can also cause new alleles to form.\nRecombination at fertilization can create new combinations of genes in offspring."}

However, this is not the most effective long-term strategy.\nPests can evolve to become resistant to a pesticide. If a pest evolves to be resistant to a pesticide, the pesticide will no longer be effective.\nHow do pests evolve to become resistant to a pesticide? When pests and the pesticide come into contact, the pests that are not affected by the pesticide are likely to survive and reproduce. Their offspring will be resistant to the pesticide.\nIf the pesticide is still being used, the pests that have evolved to be resistant to the pesticide will survive and reproduce. Their offspring will also be resistant to the pesticide. So, over time, the pest population will become more resistant to the pesticide."}

Trees grow in areas with a lot of sunlight. But trees can't grow in areas with too little water.\nAs you drive from east to west, the amount of sunlight gets higher. The length of the growing season also gets higher. A longer growing season has more time for plants to grow. So, grasslands ecosystems have more grass than tree."}

The RNA molecule, called a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, carries the information from the DNA to the ribosomes.\nThe rate at which mRNA is translated into protein is called the rate of transcription. The rate of transcription is influenced by several factors.\nTranscription factors are proteins that can bind to DNA. The binding of a transcription factor to DNA can increase the rate of transcription.\nMessenger RNA has an end, called the terminator, that signals when transcription is complete. If mRNA does not have a terminator, or if a transcription factor is bound to a DNA sequence near the terminator, transcription will not stop. This will result in a longer mRNA molecule.\nThe length of an mRNA molecule does not affect its translation into protein. But, the longer an mRNA molecule is, the more energy is needed to translate it into protein. So, cells have an incentive to keep mRNA lengths as short as possible.\nRibosomes are the factories where proteins are made. The number of ribosomes in a cell and their location within the cell can affect the rate of protein synthesis.\nSOLUTION: The rate of protein synthesis depends on the rate of transcription, which is influenced by transcription factors. Transcription factors are proteins that can bind to DNA and increase the rate of transcription. The DNA template for transcription has areas called enhancers and silencers that are near the genes they affect. Enhancers and silencers are regions of DNA that can also bind transcription factors.\nThe frequency of transcription factors in an area of DNA called the enhancer affects the rate of transcription. If a transcription factor is bound to an enhancer, the rate of transcription increases.\nThe frequency of transcription factors in a silencer decreases the rate of transcription.\nThe location and number of ribosomes in a cell will also affect the rate of protein synthesis. Cells have an incentive to keep ribosomes as close to their products as possible. As a result, ribosomes are found on the surface of the cell and within the cytoplasm."}

Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment.\nSOLUTION: One of the choices is NOT part of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection:\nMutations are the main source of all variation in a population.\nMutations are changes in genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits.\nAlthough mutations can change a gene, most mutations do not have major effects. A gene is made up of a long string of hereditary material. A mutation can change a single bead on this string, but the bead may still function normally.\nOrganisms will overpopulate an area, giving rise to competition.\nThis choice is incorrect. Overpopulation occurs when there are too many organisms in an area. Organisms in an overpopulated area compete for food and space."}

{"question": "Which of the following is most likely to increase the rate of diffusion of an uncharged solute across the plasma membrane of a cell?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decreasing the number of different solutes in the solution that bathes the cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increasing the concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increasing the ratio of phospholipids to proteins in the membrane"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decreasing the membrane potential across the membrane"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Cells are made up of many different molecules, including water and ions. These molecules are surrounded by a membrane that acts as a barrier. The membrane controls which molecules can enter or leave the cell.\nDiffusion is the process by which molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Cells use diffusion to change the concentration of molecules within their membranes.\nMany cells use facilitated diffusion to move molecules across their membranes. Facilitated diffusion is a type of transport that moves molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. To use facilitated diffusion, a cell needs a carrier protein. The carrier protein attaches to the molecule and helps move it through the membrane.\nThe rate of diffusion depends on the concentration gradient, or the difference in concentration between two areas. The higher the concentration of the molecule on one side of the membrane, the more likely the molecule is to diffuse through the membrane.\nThe rate of diffusion also depends on the partial pressure gradient, or the difference in pressure between two areas. The greater the pressure difference, the more likely the molecule is to diffuse through the membrane.\nCells use enzymes to change the concentration of molecules within their membranes. The rate at which enzymes can produce molecules depends on the enzyme concentration.\nSOLUTION: Cells increase the rate of diffusion of an uncharged solute across the plasma membrane by increasing the concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane.\nThe concentration of an uncharged solute on the outside of a cell is always equal to the concentration of the solute in the solution. As a result, the concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane is zero.\nTo increase the concentration gradient, a cell can increase the concentration of the solute on the inside of the cell.\nThe rate of diffusion is equal to the concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane. So, the higher the concentration of the solute on the inside of the cell, the higher the rate of diffusion."}

For example, plants that are better at absorbing light have a trait that can help them grow taller. If taller plants have a better chance of surviving and reproducing when exposed to light, then taller plants will increase in frequency in the population. This is directional selection for tall plants.\nAnother type of natural selection is stabilizing selection, which occurs when a population is exposed to a new trait that has types that are equally suitable. For example, dogs of different sizes have a trait (body size) that is suitable for different high-light locations. If both small and large dogs are well-suited to a high-light location, then selection will occur for dogs of various sizes. This is stabilizing selection.\nSOLUTION: This is stabilizing selection. Those who are really tall and those who are really short are not as well-suited to the environment as those of medium size. So, selection occurs against the very tall and the very short, and for those of medium size."}

During transcription, the two nucleotides are bonded together to form a codon.\nA codon is a group of three nucleotides. Codons can have six possible nucleotide sequences, or types. These six types of codons are the stop codons.\nAn amino acid is assigned to each codon, as shown in the table below.\nCodon Amino Acid\nUUU seryl\nUUC seryl\nUUC citrulline\nUUA seryl\nUUG seryl\nUCA cysteine\nUCC cysteine\nUCG leCTH re\nUCT leCTH re\nA codon that specifies a particular amino acid is called a sense codon. A codon that does not specify an amino acid is called a nonsense codon.\nSOLUTION: The mRNA molecule has a complementary codon for the tRNA molecule. A tRNA molecule has an anticodon for each codon in the mRNA molecule.\nThe anticodon is on the opposite end of the tRNA molecule from the tip. The tip of the tRNA molecule is the end that binds to the mRNA molecule.\nThe nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon is 5\u2032-U-A-C-3\u2032.\nThere are three nucleotides in a codon. So, the tRNA anticodon has three nucleotides.\nThe first nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon is 5\u2032. This tells you that the second nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon is the first nucleotide of the codon.\nThe second nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon is U. The second nucleotide of the codon is U. So, the second nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon is correct.\nThe third nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon is A. The third nucleotide of the codon is A. So, the third nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon is correct.\nThe fourth nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon is C. The fourth nucleotide of the codon is C. So, the fourth nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon is correct."}

These genes can have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of alleles, expressed as either dominant or recessive. The flower color trait in pea plants is a simple trait with two possible phenotypes. Each pea plant has a phenotype of homozygous dominant or heterozygous for the flower color trait. A homozygous dominant pea plant has two F alleles, and a phenotype of FF. A heterozygous pea plant has one F allele and one f allele, and a phenotype of Ff.\nSome traits, like the flower color trait in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with two F alleles is homozygous dominant for the flower color gene, and a plant with two f alleles is homozygous recessive.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with one F allele and one f allele is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with two F alleles will have the FF phenotype, and a plant with one F allele and one f allele will have the Ff phenotype.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with only f alleles will have the ff phenotype.\nSOLUTION: Assistant: 1. Calculate the probability that an individual has at least one F allele. This is the probability that the individual is homozygous dominant or heterozygous for the flower color gene. An organism with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait.\nThe probability of getting an F allele from each parent is 1/2. So, the probability of getting at least one F allele is 2/4 = 1/2.\n2. Calculate the probability that an individual has only f alleles. This is the probability that the individual is homozygous recessive or heterozygous for the flower color gene. An organism with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.\nThe probability of getting an f allele from each parent is also 1/2. So, the probability of getting only f alleles is 2/4 = 1/2.\n3. The probability of being a carrier but not expressing the trait is the probability of being heterozygous for the gene.

An organism's chance of inheriting a certain allele for a gene is 50% if the parent has two possible alleles for the gene.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a child's genotype may be the same as, or different from, each parent's genotype.\nA child's phenotype for an inherited trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the child's combination of alleles. A child's phenotype may be the same as, or different from, each parent's phenotype.\nThere are two possible alleles for the sickle-cell disease gene. A person's genotype for this gene is either FF, Ff, or ff.\nA person's phenotype for sickle-cell disease is whether or not the person has the disease. A person with at least one F allele has the disease. A person with only ff alleles does not have the disease.\nSo, a child's chance of inheriting sickle-cell disease is 100% if the child inherits at least one F allele. A child's chance of inheriting sickle-cell disease is 0% if the child inherits only ff alleles. A child's chance of inheriting sickle-cell disease is 50% if the child inherits one F allele and one ff allele."}

This pattern of inheritance is expected for X-linked traits.\nFemales have two X chromosomes, so they have two chances to inherit a normal X chromosome. If a female inherits one normal X chromosome, she is not affected by the trait. If a female inherits two normal X chromosomes, she is protected from the trait.\nA female with Turner's syndrome is missing part of one X chromosome. This missing part contains some of the genes that are needed for a female to clot blood. So, a female with Turner's syndrome has a high incidence of hemophilia."}

Mitochondria have two sets of membranes: an inner membrane and an outer membrane. The inner membrane is the site of ATP synthesis.\nThe inner membrane is impermeable to most substances, including ATP. This means that ATP cannot diffuse across the inner membrane. Instead, the ATP synthase can use the energy of the protons (H+) that are pumped across the inner membrane by the electron transport chain to synthesize ATP.\nWhen the electron transport chain transports electrons across the inner membrane, the protons are pumped across the inner membrane as well. The build-up of protons on the outer side of the inner membrane creates a proton gradient. The energy from this gradient is used by the ATP synthase to synthesize ATP.\nSOLUTION: NADH diffusing from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the matrix is not the direct energy source that allows ATP synthase to produce ATP. NADH is a molecule that contains energy from the breakdown of sugars and fats. When NADH diffuses from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the matrix, its energy is used to produce ATP.

One way that ecological succession can begin is by the arrival of new soil. This soil can come from erosion of a nearby landform or from the decomposition of organisms.\nAs the soil accumulates, it can support the growth of new plants. The new plants are called pioneer species.\nPioneer species are the first to colonize an area. They are the first to grow in the bare soil. Pioneer species are usually small and have special ways of surviving in the hostile environment. For example, pioneer plants on a volcanic ash slope have small leaves and a shallow root system to avoid heat and poisonous gas.\nAs pioneer species make the area habitable, they are replaced by different species. These later species have larger bodies and do not have the same specialized traits as the pioneer species.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is C.\nOrganisms that are the first to colonize a habitat undergoing ecological succession change the habitat in a way that makes it more habitable for other organisms."}

This process can cause certain traits to spread through a population.\nIf a population has a trait that helps individuals survive and reproduce, then the trait is said to be adaptive. Adaptive traits can include both body parts and behaviors.\nDirectional selection is caused by a change in the environment. A change of this type can make some traits more useful and other traits less useful.\nFor example, directional selection can happen when a new food source appears. Animals that are better at finding and eating the new food source will survive and reproduce more than animals that are not as good at finding and eating the new food source. Over time, the population will have more animals with the useful trait.\nStabilizing selection is caused by a change in the environment that does not change which traits are useful. A change of this type can make existing traits more common or less common.\nFor example, stabilizing selection can happen when a population is moved to a new environment. Both the original environment and the new environment will have a optimal set of traits. Animals that already have the optimal set of traits will survive and reproduce better than animals that do not. Over time, the population will have more animals with the optimal set of traits.\nSOLUTION: Horses have gradually increased in size over time. This is directional selection."}

These processes are how cells divide.\nAll organisms are made up of cells. An organism's cells grow and divide to replace worn-out or damaged cells. This is how an organism keeps its body parts working.\nWhen a cell divides, its chromosomes are passed to the daughter cells. Chromosomes are made of DNA, which is the genetic material that contains the information that affects inherited traits.\nSOLUTION: Meiosis and mitosis are two ways cells can divide.\nIn meiosis, the cells divide to form four daughter cells. Meiosis is how egg and sperm cells are formed.\nThe diagram below shows the stages of meiosis.\nInterphase: The cell grows and replicates its chromosomes.\nProphase I: Chromosomes condense, or get closer together.\nMetaphase I: The chromosomes line up at the equator of the cell.\nAnaphase I: The chromosomes move to opposite poles of the cell.\nTelophase I: The chromosomes settle into the two cells.\nInterphase: The cell grows and replicates its chromosomes.\nProphase II: Chromosomes condense, or get closer together.\nMetaphase II: The chromosomes line up at the equator of the cell.\nAnaphase II: The chromosomes move to opposite poles of the cell.\nTelophase II: The chromosomes settle into the two cells.\nIn mitosis, the cells divide to form two daughter cells.

This is called replicated genetic material.\nWhen a cell divides by meiosis, the daughter cells receive half of the genetic material as the parent cell. This is called non-replicated genetic material.\nSOLUTION: Meiosis and mitosis have different stages.\nThe stage of meiosis when chromosomes are replicated is called prophase I. The stage of mitosis when chromosomes are replicated is called prophase.\nThe stage of meiosis when chromosomes line up is called metaphase I. The stage of mitosis when chromosomes line up is called metaphase.\nThe stage of meiosis when chromosomes move to opposite poles of the cell is called anaphase I.

The inner membrane is folded to form cristae. The cristae increase the surface area available for the production of ATP.\nIn the matrix (the space inside the inner membrane), cellular respiration takes place. The matrix contains the enzymes and components needed to produce ATP.\nThe outer membrane surrounds the inner membrane. The outer membrane is highly folded to increase the surface area. This increased surface area allows the mitochondria to maintain a high concentration of H+ (hydrogen ions) in the space between the inner and outer membranes. This space is called the intermembrane space.\nThe H+ in the intermembrane space can be used to produce ATP. To do this, H+ must move from the intermembrane space into the matrix. This movement uses energy from ATP synthase.\nThere is one ATP synthase complex for each mitochondrion. The ATP synthase complex has two main parts: a subunit that spans the inner and outer membranes, and a subunit that is embedded in the inner membrane.\nThe subunit that spans the inner and outer membranes has a channel that passes through the walls of the subunit. This channel is made of a protein called alpha-subunit. H+ can pass through this channel.\nWhen H+ passes through the channel, it pulls a positively charged rod-like structure called the beta-subunit through the channel. This movement of the beta-subunit causes the production of ATP.\nThe first expected response after the application of oligomycin to cells is that H+ would increase inside the intermembrane space. Oligomycin prevents the H+ from moving across the inner membrane. So, the H+ accumulates in the intermembrane space."}

Neutral variation has no effect on an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, so it will not change during the course of evolution.\nIf a trait is under selection, different types of the trait will become more or less common in the population. This is called selection.\nIf a trait is not under selection, the types of the trait will remain at relative frequencies. This is called drift.\nThe relative frequencies of types will change by chance, with each type either gaining or losing frequency. The rates of these changes will be determined by the sample size of each type and the rate at which new types are arising.\nIf an organism has a large population size, the rates of change in type frequency will be determined by the rate at which new types are arising. An organism with a small population size will experience more chance changes in type frequency.\nSOLUTION: Neutral variation has no effect on an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, so it will not change during the course of evolution.

An organism with incomplete dominance has alleles, or forms, of a gene that can cause different versions of a trait. These alleles are called dominant and recessive. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its combination of alleles.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for the flower color gene is its combination of alleles. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for the flower color trait is its combination of alleles. So, a pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nEpistasis describes the interaction of two genes and their respective alleles. Epistasis can affect how an organism's alleles for one gene interact with its alleles for another gene. This interaction can change the organism's phenotype for a trait.\nFor example, in pea plants, the gene for flower color and the gene for seed color have an epistatic interaction. This means that the alleles for these genes can interact to change the pea plant's phenotype for a trait.\nAn organism with at least one dominant allele for the flower color gene and at least one dominant allele for the seed color gene will have the dominant allele's version of the traits. A pea plant with at least one recessive allele for the flower color gene and at least one recessive allele for the seed color gene will have the recessive allele's version of the traits.\nAn organism's genotype for each gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene and a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the seed color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for each trait is its combination of alleles for that trait. So, a pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers and smooth seeds for the flower and seed color traits.\nSOLUTION: Incomplete dominance describes the interaction of two alleles on one gene.

The energy is used to produce ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, which is the energy currency of the cell.\nThe immediate source of this energy is the transfer of a phosphate group to ADP. When a molecule of ADP is added to a molecule of phosphate, the result is ATP. This reaction is exergonic, or energy-releasing.\nThe energy used in oxidative phosphorylation is produced by the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. During cellular respiration, the breakdown products of these macromolecules are broken down and used to produce ATP. The breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins is called metabolism.\nThe electron transport chain is part of the oxidative phosphorylation process. In this chain, electrons are flowing down a chain of proteins. As the electrons move, they attract oxygen. When the electrons reach the end of the chain, they are attracted to oxygen. This reaction releases energy.\nThe proton gradient across the membrane where the ATP synthase is embedded represents potential energy. This energy is used to produce ATP."}

Darwin noted that many fossils were found in certain types of rock. He used this observation to conclude that organisms have changed over time.\nDarwin also noticed that animal and plant species come in many different types. He noticed that these types have different ranges. Some species are found only in tropical rainforests. Others live in colder climates. Darwin noticed that the types of organisms found in a particular area come in related types. They are related to each other in the way that they look and act.\nDarwin's observations helped him to understand how new species form. One species becomes a new species when its offspring can no longer reproduce with the offspring of the original species. This happens when one group of offspring has changed in ways that make them unable to reproduce with the offspring of the original species.\nDarwin's observations also helped him to understand why different species occur in different places. Species that are adapted to a particular environment are more likely to survive in that environment. So, offspring that are adapted to a particular environment are more likely to reproduce in that environment. This is how environmental conditions can lead to the formation of new species.\nSOLUTION: Six observations helped Darwin shape his concept of descent with modification.\nMany fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks are formed in sediments. Sediments are particles of rock, soil, or mud. Over time, water or air fills in around the sediments to form a sedimentary rock.\nMany fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. This suggests that organisms have changed over time.\nScientists have found similar patterns of animal and plant fossils in different parts of the world. This observation suggests that all organisms are descended from common ancestors.\nSOLUTION: Birds can be found on islands located farther from the mainland than the birds' maximum nonstop flight distance. This observation helps to explain why some birds live on islands. Birds that cannot fly to an island can still get to the island by hitchhiking on rocks, wood, or plant material that is floating on the ocean.\nSOLUTION: South American temperate plants are more similar to the tropical plants of South America than to the temperate plants of Europe. This observation helps to explain why South American plants are so different from plants in other parts of the world.\nSOLUTION: Species diversity declines farther from the equator. This observation helps to explain why there are more species in the tropics than in other parts of the world."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome genes have regulatory elements that affect when and where the gene's alleles are used. These regulatory elements can be far from the gene they regulate. One type of regulatory element is a transcription factor. A transcription factor can bind to a sequence of nucleotides called a response element, which is near a gene. The transcription factor and response element can be far from the gene they regulate. When the transcription factor and response element are bound, the gene's alleles are used to make transcripts.\nAn organism's combination of transcription factor alleles is called its transcription factor allele pattern. A pea plant may have a transcription factor allele pattern of FF, Ff, or ff for a gene.\nSOLUTION: A gene's transcription start site is the place where transcription begins. A gene's promoter is the region of the DNA near the transcription start site that binds the RNA polymerase transcription factor. The RNA polymerase transcription factor is involved in initiating transcription.\nAn organism's combination of promoter alleles is called its promoter allele pattern. A pea plant may have a promoter allele pattern of FF, Ff, or ff for a gene.\nThe operator and repressor are types of regulatory elements that can affect a gene's transcription. But they do not have a direct effect on the gene's transcription start site."}

This isolation prevents the organisms from mating and producing offspring. Over time, the isolated population may evolve into a new species.\nThere are four steps in the process of allopatric speciation:\n1. Geographical isolation: The organisms become isolated from each other, usually because one group moves to a new location.\n2. Reproductive isolation: The isolated populations become unable to mate with each other. This may be due to the development of sexual behaviors that no longer match, or to the appearance of physical barriers that prevent mating.\n3. Differential changes in allele frequencies: The populations experience changes in the frequencies of their alleles, or forms of a gene. These changes may occur by natural selection, genetic drift, or other factors.\n4. Reproductive barriers: The populations become completely incompatible, so that they cannot produce offspring when mated. At this point, the populations are separate species.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is D.\nFirst, the populations are geographically isolated from each other.\nThen, reproductive isolation occurs.\nNext, the allele frequencies in the isolated populations change.\nFinally, reproductive barriers prevent the populations from producing offspring."}
{"question": "In a hypothetical population's gene pool, an autosomal gene, which had previously been fixed, undergoes a mutation that introduces a new allele, one inherited according to incomplete dominance.

This means that the favored allele becomes more common and the unfavored allele becomes less common.\nSOLUTION: For a locus with two possible alleles, the genotypes are heterozygous and homozygous. The three possible genotypes are:\nHomozgyous: an individual has two identical alleles.\nHeterozygous: an individual has two different alleles.\nThe types of alleles in an individual's genotype are shown in the table below.\nType of allele | Homyzgous | Heterozygous |\nfavored | F | f\nunfavored | C | c\nAn individual's genotype is represented by one of the three symbols: F, f, or C.\nAn individual's phenotype is represented by one of the two possible types.

An individual with one F allele and one f allele has a phenotype of F. An individual with two c alleles has a phenotype of c.\nStabilizing selection occurs at a locus. This means that the selection favors alleles that are closer to the average value for the population. Over many generations, the proportion of the population that is heterozygous at this locus remains constant. This constant proportion represents the average value for the population.\nThe proportion of the population that is homozygous for the favored allele increases.

As species adapt to their environment, some traits become more common in a population. Other traits become rarer.\nSpecies that live in different environments may have different adaptations. For example, animals that live in cold environments have fur and fat to keep warm. Animals that live in hot environments have ways to attract water and regulate their water content to stay cool.\nSOLUTION: The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean about 906 kilometers west of Ecuador. Finches, which are birds, live on the islands.\nMany different species of finches live on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Each species of finch has a specialized adaptation that helps it obtain food. For example, some finches eat insects, while others eat seeds.\nSouth America is the presumed origin of the finch ancestor. But why do similar adaptations not exist among the finches of the South American mainland?\nThe answer is that the various foods available on the mainland are different than those on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. So, the finches on the mainland did not need to specialize in obtaining food."}

These events may have started slowly, but they also included catastrophic events that took place in a geological instant.\nSlow processes can turn into catastrophic events. For example, a river can erode its banks and create a new course over a period of years. But if the river's flow suddenly increases by several times, it can cut down into the earth much more quickly.\nSome geologists think that many landscape features were formed by a combination of slow and rapid events. For example, a river may have cut its valley over many millions of years. But a large flood event may have widened and deepened the valley much more quickly.\nThe idea of catastrophism has been applied to the formation of Earth's landscapes and the history of life."}

{"question": "A small population of birds is blown to an isolated island by a hurricane and establishes a colony.

This process can occur when a species moves into a new ecological niche, or when it is introduced to a new environment. As the species adapts to its new environment, its genes may split into different alleles, or forms of the gene. Some of these alleles may become more common in the population because they are better adapted to the new environment.\nFor example, consider a species of finch that moves to a group of islands. If the finch population is large enough to generate a significant amount of genetic variation, some of the alleles may become better adapted to the island environment. For example, some alleles may cause the finch to lay more eggs, on average, or to grow to a larger size.\nAs these better-adapted alleles become more common in the population, the finch population may diverge into a group of related species. Each species will have a different combination of alleles, or genotype, that is better adapted to the different environments found on the islands.\nSOLUTION: The gene pool of the newly established population of birds is likely to reflect the effects of genetic drift.\nGenetic drift is the random fluctuation of gene frequencies in a population over time. These fluctuations can cause some alleles to become more common or less common in the population.\nA small population, such as a group of birds blown to an isolated island by a hurricane, is more likely to experience the effects of genetic drift than a large population. As the population of birds establishes a new colony on the island, some alleles may become more common or less common in the population. These changes in allele frequencies will affect the gene pool of the population."}

When an organism has two possible alleles, or forms, for a gene, it is heterozygous for that gene. Heterozygotes may have an advantage in that they have a combination of alleles that is more beneficial than either allele alone. This can occur when one allele is bad and the other allele is good, or when the two alleles have different effects that are beneficial when combined.\nSOLUTION: Heterozygote advantage is most closely linked to stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection is a type of selection that tends to maintain the status quo. It selects for organisms that have alleles that do not cause too much harm or too much benefit.\nHeterozygote advantage is a type of stabilizing selection. It maintains a moderate combination of alleles that is not too harmful or too beneficial.\nHeterozygote advantage is not closely linked to sexual selection, random selection, or directional selection.\nSOLUTION: Sexual selection is a type of selection that is based on attracting mates. It can lead to the evolution of traits that are more obvious or exaggerated than would be expected under stabilizing selection. Heterozygote advantage is not closely linked to sexual selection because it does not cause a noticeable change in an organism's appearance or behavior.\nRandom selection is a type of selection that is not directed at any particular trait. It is like a random draw. Heterozygote advantage is not closely linked to random selection because it is not a random occurrence.\nDirectional selection is a type of selection that is directed at a particular trait. It leads to the evolution of more extreme versions of that trait. Heterozygote advantage is not closely linked to directional selection because it does not cause an organism to have more extreme alleles."}

This means that during an animal's development, cells in different tissues become specialized to perform different tasks.\nHow do cells become specialized? Cells become specialized by controlling which genes are turned on or off. Some genes contain information for building the parts of a cell. Other genes contain information for building the parts of an animal.\nAnimals have many genes, but not all of these genes are used for every type of cell. Different genes are used for different types of cells. For example, a animal's skin cells and heart cells have different sets of genes.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, which diseases it may have, and which diseases it may recover from. An organism's genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Cells in different tissues contain different sets of genes, leading to structural and functional differences. This statement is most correct. It describes how differences in the genotype for a gene can lead to differences in the organism's phenotype."}

Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The genotype for this gene is a combination of two alleles. An organism with genotype FF, Ff, or ff has two possible types for this gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for seed color is its combination of alleles for the seed color gene.

This diagram shows what happens during fertilization:\nThe sperm fuses with the egg to form the zygote.\nAt the same time, the mitochondria and other materials from the sperm fuse with the egg. This is called the cortical reaction.\nA small portion of the egg breaks away during fertilization to form the polar body.\nThe zygote begins to divide and grow, forming a new embryo.\nSOLUTION: The acrosome and cortical reactions ensure that the zygote will begin to divide normally.\nThe acrosome reaction occurs when the sperm contacts the egg. The acrosome, which is a part of the sperm, releases enzymes that help the sperm penetrate the egg.\nThe cortical reaction occurs during or after the acrosome reaction. The cortical reaction involves the fusion of the mitochondria and other materials from the sperm with the egg. This provides the zygote with the nutrients and energy it needs to begin cell division."}

Water has cohesion because the molecules in water are attracted to each other.\nAdhesion is when water sticks to other substances. Water has adhesion because the molecules in water are attracted to other types of matter.\nCapillary action is when a substance moves up a surface. In water, capillary action makes water move up the sides of a glass.\nHydrophobicity is when water is repelled by other substances. Many substances are hydrophobic because the molecules in water and the molecules in the substance are attracted to each other.\nSOLUTION: Transpiration is when water is released from the leaves of a plant. The water travels through a plant's vascular system and into the air.\nTranspiration is a result of special properties of water. The special properties of water include cohesion, adhesion, and capillary action. But transpiration is not a result of hydrophobicity.

An organism's genetic material is passed from parents to offspring.\nOffspring receive their genetic material, or genes, from their parents. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nGenes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: A repressor is a protein that binds to a specific site on a DNA molecule and prevents another protein from binding to the site. This process is called repression.\nThe operator is the site on the DNA molecule where the repressor protein binds. The promoter is the site on the DNA molecule where the RNA polymerase enzyme binds to begin transcription of the gene.\nA repressor protein is a transcriptional repressor because it acts on the promoter site. A transcriptional repressor is a type of protein that binds to a DNA molecule and prevents another protein from binding to the promoter site.\nThe figure below shows how a transcriptional repressor can prevent transcription of a gene. The repressor protein binds to the promoter site on the DNA molecule. Without the repressor protein, RNA polymerase would bind to the promoter site. But with the repressor protein, RNA polymerase is unable to bind. So, the gene is not transcribed."}

As populations of organisms change over time, the types of organisms in them may also change. This process is called evolution.\nEvolution may occur in response to changes in the environment. For example, finches that have smaller beaks may have an advantage in getting food on the Galapagos Islands. Finches with smaller beaks are more likely to survive and produce offspring. Over many generations, finches with smaller beaks may evolve into a new species.\nThere are several ways that evolution may occur:\nConvergent evolution is when different populations of organisms evolve to have the same traits. This process may be driven by similar environmental pressures. For example, flight is a trait that birds and bats have evolved. Flight is a helpful trait for avoiding predators.\nDivergent evolution is when different populations of organisms evolve to have different traits. This process may be driven by different environmental pressures. For example, dogs and cats are mammals. But dogs have small brains and perform functions such as hunting and guarding. Cats have large brains and hunt for food.\nDisruptive selection is when different populations of organisms evolve traits that are very different from each other. Disruptive selection may occur when there are two types of organisms with different eating habits. For example, the wings of beetles and butterflies have evolved in very different ways.\nStabilizing selection is when different populations of organisms evolve traits that are similar to each other.

{"question": "Darwin's mechanism of natural selection required long time spans in order to modify species.

The first edition of Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published in 1859.\nDarwin's friend and mentor, the geologist Charles Lyell, was the first person to whom Darwin confided his ideas. Lyell was already an influential scientist, and his own work provided evidence for a much older Earth than most people believed at the time. In 1830, Lyell published his famous book, Principles of Geology. In it, he argued that the Earth's landscape had evolved over a period of many millions of years, rather than being formed by Noah's flood, as many people believed.\nLyell's ideas about the Earth's age and the importance of long time spans impressed Darwin. Darwin saw that the same sort of slow, steady process that could shape the earth might also apply to the evolution of species.\nDarwin's other important influence was the French scientist Georges Cuvier. Cuvier was a prominent anatomist and paleontologist who lived in the early 1800 s. He was one of the first people to examine the fossil record, or the remains of ancient organisms. Cuvier noticed that many fossils were different from any living organisms. He concluded that many ancient species had gone extinct.\nDarwin read about Cuvier's work in college. Later, Darwin saw some of Cuvier's fossils while in Paris. These fossils helped to convince Darwin that species could become extinct.\nDarwin's other precedessor, Alfred Wallace, was a naturalist who was spreading the word about evolution even before Darwin did. In the 1850 s, Wallace was collecting specimens in the Amazon Rainforest. He noticed that the species in the rainforest were not always the same as the species in other parts of the world. Wallace wondered if this might be because the species had evolved to their current forms.\nWallace's ideas about evolution were similar to Darwin's. In 1858, Wallace sent a paper about evolution to Darwin. Darwin was impressed with Wallace's ideas. So, Darwin decided to publish his own theory in order to get it out to more people."}

It is called a spike. Action potentials are generated by changes in the membrane's permeability to positive charges.\nWhen the voltage of a nerve cell's membrane reaches a threshold level, the cell is said to have an action potential. The positive charges from inside the cell rush out, and the voltage of the membrane drops. This is called depolarization.\nThe voltage of a nerve cell's membrane then returns to its normal level, but the depolarization has caused the cell to release neurotransmitters, chemicals that allow the cell to communicate with other cells.\nSOLUTION: When several strong stimuli are experienced by the axon, the strength of the action potential becomes greater.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nAn organism's genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nAn organism's fitness is a measure of its ability to survive and reproduce. An organism's fitness depends on its combination of alleles. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nFor example, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele. In pea plants, the F allele causes its version of the flower color trait to appear as the organism's phenotype. The f allele has no effect on the organism's phenotype.\nAn organism's fitness is increased by having alleles that are dominant or that have types that are dominant. In pea plants, the FF and Ff genotypes have alleles that are dominant, so these genotypes have a higher fitness than the ff genotype.\nSOLUTION: An organism's fitness is most directly measured by the number of its offspring that survive to reproduce. An organism's offspring that survive to reproduce will have at least some of the organism's alleles. An organism with offspring that survive to reproduce will have a higher fitness than an organism with no offspring or offspring that do not survive to reproduce."}

The chains are typically folded into a specific three-dimensional shape. This shape allows the protein to have more than one binding site.\nAllosteric proteins can be regulated by binding to a site other than the main binding site. This binding changes the shape of the protein, which can affect which molecules the protein can bind to. The shape of the protein can also affect which molecules the protein can bind to.\nThink about how the shape of a lock and key affects whether they fit together. The shape of the lock was designed to fit only with the key. So, when the key is inserted into the lock, it changes the shape of the lock. This changed shape allows the key to turn and activate the lock.\nIn a similar way, when a molecule binds to an allosteric protein, it changes the shape of the protein. This changed shape can affect which molecules the protein can bind to.\nSOLUTION: Heme proteins, such as hemoglobin, are allosteric proteins. Hemoglobin's shape changes affect its ability to bind to O2 and CO2.\nWhen exercising muscle tissue uses more oxygen, it also uses more hemoglobin. This causes the concentration of hemoglobin to decrease. As the concentration of hemoglobin decreases, its affinity for O2 increases. Affinity is the tendency of a molecule to bind to another molecule.\nSo, hemoglobin's affinity for O2 increases in exercising muscle tissue."}
{"question": "A researcher grows a population of ferns in her laboratory. She notices, after a few generations, a new variant that has a distinct phenotype.

Reproduction is the process by which cells and organisms make new cells and organisms.\nOffspring cells and organisms are similar to, but not identical to, their parents.

Genes are pieces of hereditary material that are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.\nOther variants are caused by the environment. Some variants, such as riding a bicycle, are caused by learning.\nSOLUTION: The new variant is likely caused by divergent selection.

An organism has two alleles for each gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent. Alleles can be dominant or recessive.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the gene to be expressed, even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. For example, in pea plants, the dominant allele F is for purple flowers and the recessive allele f is for white flowers. An organism with at least one dominant allele for the F gene will have the F allele's version of the gene. So, the organism will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele is expressed only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene.

So, the organism will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Tay-Sachs is caused by a recessive allele. An organism with only recessive alleles for the gene will have the recessive allele's version of the gene. So, people who are homozygous recessive for the Tay-Sachs gene will have the disease.\nBut Tay-Sachs is a fatal disease.

DNA contains the genetic instructions for building the parts of an organism.\nMutations can cause many different types of genetic disorders. Some mutations have no effect, while others can cause mild, moderate, or severe disorders.\nSOLUTION: The last three choices all are frameshift mutations.\nA frameshift mutation occurs when a single nucleotide is deleted or inserted into a DNA sequence. This can result in a completely different protein being produced.\nFor example, if a thymine is inserted into the sequence CTG, the sequence becomes CTG1. This change results in the production of a completely different protein than the one that would have been produced by the original sequence.\nThe first choice is not a frameshift mutation.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism.\nAn organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The retrovirus's insertion of its DNA into the bacterial gene altered the normal reading frame by one base pair. This changed the way the bacterial gene's instructions were assembled.\nThe type of mutation that results from changing the normal reading frame by one or more base pairs is called a frameshift mutation."}

If this concentration difference was not maintained, the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane would continue indefinitely. This would be a violation of the law of mass action, which states that for any chemical reaction, the concentration differences of the reactants will equal the concentration differences of the products.\nThe concentration difference of a substance in a cell is called its concentration gradient. A concentration gradient can be established by changing the amount of a substance in a cell. For example, a cell can increase the amount of a substance inside its cells or decrease the amount of a substance outside its cells.\nWhen a cell has more of a substance inside its cells than outside its cells, the inside of the cell has a higher concentration of the substance than the outside. This type of concentration gradient is called a high concentration inside the cell.\nA cell can use a high concentration gradient to drive a substance to diffuse from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This is how solutes move through a cell membrane.\nWhen a substance moves through a cell membrane, the concentration gradient that drives the substance's diffusion is reduced. This movement is called diffusion.\nFacilitated diffusion is a type of active transport that does not require energy from the cell. In facilitated diffusion, the concentration gradient is reduced, but not completely eliminated. This allows substances to diffuse from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, but at a rate that is dependent on the concentration gradient.\nActive transport is a type of cell transport that requires energy from the cell. In active transport, the cell's concentration gradient is reduced to a point where the substance moves from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This type of transport can be used to move substances from the environment into the cell.\nPlasmolysis is the process by which a cell gains or loses water. When a cell gains water, it may plasmolyze by taking in water from the environment. When a cell loses water, it may plasmolyze by releasing water from the cell."}

The phospholipids have a head and a tail. The head loves water and the tail is repelled by it. This makes the head attract the water on the outside of the membrane, and repel the water on the inside of the membrane. The membrane is thus made up of a layer of water on the outside and a layer of water on the inside.\nThe head of each phospholipid can have a charge. If the head has a positive charge, it is called a cation. If the head has a negative charge, it is called an anion.\nSome proteins in the membrane have an area that can be a cation or an anion. This area is called a charge site.\nWhen a cation is at a charge site, it can attract a hydrogen ion from the water layer on the inside of the membrane. This leaves the water layer with a higher concentration of hydrogen ions than the layer on the outside of the membrane. The hydrogen ions will move across the membrane by diffusion until the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal on both sides of the membrane.\nThis movement of hydrogen ions is called a proton transfer.\nWhen a protein in the membrane is acting as a proton pump, it can use energy from the cell to move hydrogen ions into the water layer on the outside of the membrane. This creates a area with a higher concentration of hydrogen ions on the outside of the membrane.\nOther proteins in the membrane can detect this change in the concentration of hydrogen ions. These proteins can use the change in hydrogen ion concentration to send a signal to the cell.\nSOLUTION: Mammalian nerve cells have special cells called neurons that are covered in a layer of membrane called a myelin sheath. Neurons use a lot of energy to send signals to other cells.\nOther mammalian cells, including muscle cells, also use a lot of energy. But they do not have a myelin sheath.\nPlants and fungi have a different way of sending signals to different parts of their cells. They use a system of tubes that can move water and minerals through the cell. This system also helps the plant or fungi get rid of waste.\nBacteria have a cell wall that keeps the cell safe from the outside environment. The cell wall also helps keep the right balance of water and minerals inside the cell."}

The base composition of DNA varies from one species to another.\nThese four nitrogenous bases occur in two forms, called DNA and RNA. In DNA, adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine. In RNA, adenine always pairs with uracil, and guanine always pairs with cytosine.\nSOLUTION: The pairs of bases in DNA are called base pairs. The base composition of a molecule is its combination of bases. So, a molecule of DNA has a base composition.\nThe base composition of a molecule of DNA is a constant ratio of the numbers of bases. This ratio is often called the base composition.\nSo, the base composition of a molecule of DNA is a constant ratio of the numbers of adenine and thymine or guanine and cytosine."}

Some organisms have both inherited and acquired traits that help them survive and reproduce. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.\nInherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.\nAcquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment."}
{"question": "This process couples the production of ATP with the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain by harnessing the driving force created by a proton gradient.", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glycolysis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chemiosmosis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fermentation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Calvin cycle"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "LECTURE: Chemiosmosis is the process by which organisms convert chemical energy into ATP. This process occurs in cells that have a membrane-bound organelle called a chloroplast.\nChemiosmosis uses the energy of protons, which are hydrogen ions. During chemiosmosis, protons move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This movement of protons is accompanied by the movement of electrons.\nThe energy of the protons is used to produce ATP. ATP is a type of energy that cells can use for a variety of purposes.\nThe process of chemiosmosis begins with glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose. Glycolysis releases glucose from cells. Cells use the energy from glucose to create molecules called NADH and FADH2. These molecules contain electrons that will be used to produce ATP.\nThe NADH and FADH2 molecules are then transported to the chloroplast's mitochondria. In the mitochondria, the NADH and FADH2 molecules are \"accepted\" by the electron transport chain.\nAs the electrons move through the electron transport chain, they generate a proton gradient. A proton gradient is a difference in the concentration of protons between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes.\nThe energy from the proton gradient is used to produce ATP. This production of ATP is called chemiosmosis.\nSOLUTION: The Calvin cycle occurs in the chloroplast. The Calvin cycle is a process that uses carbon dioxide to produce sugars.\nThe Calvin cycle does not produce ATP directly from the energy of protons.\nThe other choices describe processes that do produce ATP directly from the energy of protons."}

The solutes make the water \"dirty\" or more concentrated. As water moves out of the area with solutes, the water potential of the water decreases.\nThe area of low water potential is an area where there are few solutes. The solutes make the water \"clean\" or less concentrated. As water moves into the area with fewer solutes, the water potential of the water increases.\nSOLUTION: The potato is made of cells that are mostly water. The cells of a potato have a high water potential, or a lot of solutes. The pure water has a low water potential, or few solutes.\nWhen the potato is placed in the water, the water moves from the surrounding water into the potato. As the water moves into the potato, the water potential of the water decreases. The potato cells plasmolyze, or become soft."}
