A supernova can occur in one of several ways.\nType I. A white dwarf in a binary system feeds on matter from a companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit. The star then becomes unstable and explodes.\nType II. A giant star runs out of fuel and becomes a red giant. The red giant loses mass, and the stellar core becomes hotter and denser. When the core becomes hot enough, it can cause a supernova.\nType II-P. A giant star has a stable helium core and a convective shell. The star continues to grow in size, and when the helium core reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit, the star explodes.\nType II-L. A giant star has an unstable helium core and a convective shell. The star experience sudden mass loss, and when the helium core reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit, the star explodes.\nType Ib. A star with a mass between 4 and 8 times the mass of the sun experiences a core collapse. The star does not have a companion star.\nType Ic. A star with a mass between 8 and 10 times the mass of the sun experiences a core collapse. The star does not have a companion star.\nType II-P and Type II-L. These two types are similar, except for how the helium core reaches its critical mass.\nType II-P stars experience a gradual increase in mass, while Type II-L stars experience a sudden increase in mass.\nType Ia. A white dwarf in a binary system feeds on matter from a companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit. The star then becomes unstable and explodes.\nType Ia supernovas are thought to be caused by white dwarfs that gain mass until they reach the Chandrasekhar mass limit.

This is because of the radiation pressure from the Sun's light.\nRadiation pressure is a type of pressure that can be exerted on reflective surfaces. When the Sun's light strikes a comet's tail, the ions in the tail are pushed away from the Sun. The tail will always point away from the Sun because of the conservation of the angular momentum in the tail.\nAngular momentum is a property of objects that determines how they move. Angular momentum is conserved whenever an object is not affected by an external torque. So, because the tail of a comet is not affected by an external torque, the tail will always point away from the Sun.\nSOLUTION: The plasma tail of a comet always points away from the Sun because of radiation pressure from the Sun's light."}

Of the four terrestrial planets, Earth has the strongest magnetic field.\nWhy does Earth have the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds?\nThere are several theories about why Earth has the strongest magnetic field. One theory is that Earth's core is composed of a unique type of iron. Most iron magnetizes easily, but this type of iron does not. As a result, it does not cause Earth's core to be magnetically charged. This leaves another type of iron in the core to attract and repel other types of iron, creating a magnetic field.\nOther theories about the origin of Earth's magnetic field are based on the motion of Earth's core.

The impact blasted material from the Earth into orbit, where it eventually coalesced to form the Moon.\nThe Moon is a piece of the Earth that was flung into orbit by a collision with another planet.\nThe Moon formed from the Earth's own material, but not from accretion. The Earth was rotating so quickly that matter was thrown off and went into orbit to form the Moon.\nSOLUTION: The Moon split from the Earth due to tidal forces is not a main hypothesis for the origin of the Moon.

This cloud contained all of the matter that would eventually form the sun, the planets, and the moons.\nThe earliest part of this process is called the preplanetary nebula. During this time, dust and gas clumped together to form particles. These particles, called planetesimals, continued to clump together over millions of years to form the building blocks of the planets.\nThe planetesimals collided and stuck together, forming larger and larger objects. Some of the objects grew quickly, while others grew more slowly. The planets grew quickly, while the leftover planetesimals did not have enough mass to become planets. Instead, they remained as asteroids and comets.\nSOLUTION: The Solar Nebular theory says that the planets formed from the collapse of a cloud of gas and dust. According to the theory, asteroids and comets are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets."}

It turns out that the position of the north celestial pole changes very slowly, so the latitude of a spot on the Earth is equal to the altitude of the north celestial pole as seen from that spot.\nThe latitude of a point is an angle that tells you how far north or south the point is. The latitude can range from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.\nIf the altitude of the north celestial pole is 0\u00b0, then the north celestial pole is directly overhead. This means that the observer is at the Earth's North Pole.\nAs the altitude of the north celestial pole increases, the north celestial pole rises in the sky. This means that the observer is further north.\nIf the altitude of the north celestial pole is 90\u00b0, then the north celestial pole is directly on the horizon. This means that the observer is at the equator.\nAs the altitude of the north celestial pole decreases, the north celestial pole sinks in the sky. This means that the observer is further south.\nSOLUTION: The latitude of a point is the same as the altitude of the north celestial pole as seen from that point. So, to determine your latitude, look at the altitude of the north celestial pole.\nThe altitude of the north celestial pole is the angle from the horizon to the north celestial pole. To find this angle, imagine looking at the north celestial pole from above. The north celestial pole would be directly underneath you. Now, look back at the north celestial pole as you would see it. The angle between the ground and the north celestial pole is the altitude of the north celestial pole."}

When the Sun heats the Earth's surface, the surface re-emits this heat as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb this radiation, and since the gases are also good at absorbing infrared radiation, the heat is trapped in the atmosphere. This process makes the atmosphere and the surface warmer than they would be without the greenhouse effect.\nThe greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases. These gases are like a blanket that keeps a person warm. If a person is wearing a thick blanket, the person will be warm. If a person is wearing a thin blanket, the person will be cold.\nThe thickness of a blanket is a lot like the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. More greenhouse gases make the atmosphere thicker, or more like a heavier blanket. This thickness, or concentration, affects the amount of heat that is trapped in the atmosphere.\nThere are many different greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Some greenhouse gases are made by human activities. These greenhouse gases are called anthropogenic greenhouse gases.\nAnthropogenic greenhouse gases keep the atmosphere and the surface warmer than they would be without them. As more anthropogenic greenhouse gases are made, the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere grows. This increases the thickness of the atmosphere's blanket, or greenhouse effect.\nThis increase in the greenhouse effect is called global warming.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is B. When the Sun heats the Earth's surface, the surface re-emits this heat as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb this radiation, and since the gases are also good at absorbing infrared radiation, the heat is trapped in the atmosphere. This process makes the atmosphere and the surface warmer than they would be without the greenhouse effect."}

For example, Venus orbits the Sun in 1.6 years, which is a 1.5:1 resonance with the Earth's orbital period of 1 year.\nWhen objects are in orbital resonance, they may have regular encounters with each other. The diagram below shows two objects, A and B, with B orbiting A. The blue arrows represent A's orbit. The yellow arrows represent B's orbit.\nIf the orbital period of B is a simple fraction of the orbital period of A, then B is in orbital resonance with A.\nSOLUTION: Neptune's orbital period is 165 Earth years. Pluto's orbital period is 248 Earth years. So, the ratio of Neptune's period to Pluto's period is 165:248, or 2:3. This is a periodic ratio, which means that the two planets are in a 2:3 resonance.\nSaturn has many small rings with gaps between them. These gaps are called Kirkwood gaps. They occur because the resonance periods of the gaps are simple fractions of Saturn's orbital period.\nSaturn's moons are broken into small pieces to form the rings. The pieces are called ring material."}

Climate is changed by changes in the environment.\nSOLUTION: Mars lost its magnetic field, and that change in the environment caused its climate to change.\nA planet's magnetic field can help to keep the atmosphere. A planet without a magnetic field will lose its atmosphere to space. When Mars lost its magnetic field, the solar wind was able to strip away most of the atmosphere. The atmosphere is made of air. Air is a gas. Gases are able to move. When the atmosphere moves to space, the greenhouse effect is significantly reduced. The greenhouse effect is the warming of a planet's atmosphere due to the effect of greenhouse gases.\nThe greenhouse effect is caused by gases in a planet's atmosphere. Some of these gases, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide, keep planets warm. These gases trap heat from the sun in a planet's atmosphere. Without a strong magnetic field, Mars cooled down because it could not trap as much heat from the sun."}

The closest point to you is called the periapsis, and the farthest point is called the apoapsis.\nIf an object is in an elliptical orbit, the closest point to the object is called the periapsis. The farthest point is called the apoapsis.\nThe length of an elliptical orbit is different for the periapsis and the apoapsis. The distance between the periapsis and the apoapsis is called the semi-major axis.\nIf an object's semi-major axis increases, its orbit becomes less elliptical and more circular.\nIf an object's semi-major axis decreases, its orbit becomes more elliptical and less circular.\nSOLUTION: Imagine that the distance from the Earth to the Sun increases.

These planets are too large to have formed so close to their stars. So, astronomers have tried to explain how they got there.\nOne idea is that hot Jupiters formed farther out and then moved in. This process, called migration, can be caused by interactions between the planet and nearby stars.\nAnother idea is that hot Jupiters formed in their current locations. This idea has trouble explaining why hot Jupiters are so close to their stars, but it is still a topic of research.\nSOLUTION: The best answer is B.\nSOLUTION: Forming as gas giants beyond the frost line and then migrating inwards is one way that hot Jupiters might have formed.\nThe frost line is a distance from a star beyond which water would freeze. If a planet forms beyond the frost line, it will have a layer of gas and ice. When the planet moves inward, the ice will be heated and will change into a gas. This gas will expand the planet, forming a gas giant."}

The aperture is the largest distance between two points in a telescope. The size of the mirror or lens affects the telescope's angle of view and its resolution.\nSOLUTION: To measure the distance between objects, you can use the resolution of a telescope. The resolution tells you how sharp the image of a distant object will be. A sharp image shows details in an object's image.\nTo use the telescope's resolution to measure the distance between objects, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the object you want to measure the distance to.\n2. Find another object that is close to the object you want to measure the distance to.\n3. Use the telescope's eyepiece to look at the two objects.\n4. If the two objects are far apart, the image will be sharp.

When the Sun's rays hit Earth, they bounce back a portion of the light that hit them as infrared light. This happens because some of the energy in the light was not used to heat the ground. The ground, in turn, emits infrared light.\nThe greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb the infrared light. When the greenhouse gases absorb the infrared light, the energy from the light is transferred to the greenhouse gases. This makes the greenhouse gases warm.\nWhen the greenhouse gases warm, they re-emit some of the energy as infrared light. The infrared light that is emitted by the greenhouse gases moves in all directions. Some of the infrared light moves straight up.\nThe infrared light that moves straight up ends up reaching the Sun. When the Sun's surface reaches the infrared light, the infrared light is re-emitted as more light. This extra light is called backscattering.\nThe greenhouse effect is the result of the backscattering of light by the gases in the atmosphere. The backscattering of light keeps the atmosphere and the ground warmer than they would be without the greenhouse effect.\nSOLUTION: The correct answer is A.\nGreenhouse gases absorb infrared light from the Sun which then heats the atmosphere and the surface."}

This trapped energy warms the planet. The greenhouse effect is important because it keeps a planet's temperature within the range that allows life to exist.\nA planet's atmosphere traps energy from the sun in the form of heat. This heat energy is called insolation.\nThe greenhouse effect happens when the atmosphere traps some of the insolation. This trapped insolation warms the planet. The strength of a planet's greenhouse effect depends on the type and amount of gases in the atmosphere.\nThe greenhouse effect requires an atmosphere that contains certain gases. These gases are called greenhouse gases. The greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere include water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone.\nThe greenhouse effect does not require an ozone layer. The ozone layer is a part of Earth's atmosphere that contains ozone. Some greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, have layers in the atmosphere. When these gases absorb insolation, the insolation warms the planet.\nMars does not have a strong greenhouse effect. Mars does not have enough of the gases that can form a greenhouse effect. The atmosphere on Mars is mostly made up of carbon dioxide. But there is not enough carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to create a strong greenhouse effect.\nMars is too far from the sun for the greenhouse effect to work. This choice is incorrect. The greenhouse effect can work on any planet, even one that is far from the sun."}

So, they do not have a clear surface and a well-defined interior. Their bulging at the equator is called oblateness.\nOblateness is caused by the planet's rotation and its overall mass. The rotation of a planet causes it to fling outward whatever mass is closest to the axis of rotation. For a planet, the axis of rotation is the line that goes through the planet's center.\nSOLUTION: A jovian planet bulges at the equator because of its rapid rotation.
