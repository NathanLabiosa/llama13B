About $3k\nTo answer this question, you need to convert the 1850 GDP per capita in the United States to 2011 prices using the method of purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP adjusts for the differences in the cost of goods and services between countries, allowing for a like-for-like comparison of GDP per capita. To do this, we need to first convert the 1850 GDP per capita to 2011 dollars using the method of deflating the nominal value using the consumer price index (CPI). Then, we can convert this value to 2011 PPP using the World Bank's PPP conversion factor for the United States in 2011.\nUsing the CPI and PPP conversion factors, we can calculate the 2011 value of the 1850 GDP per capita as follows:\n1850 GDP per capita = $300\n1850 GDP per capita in 2011 dollars = $300 / (1 + 0.028) ^ (1850"}

Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising in an economy over a period of time. By controlling for inflation and PPP-adjustment, you can compare the purchasing power of a currency over time and adjust for changes in currency values.\nIn this case, the question asks about the increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016 in South Korea. To calculate this, you would need to first find the GDP per capita for each year and then compare it to the previous year. You would also need to adjust for inflation using a measure like the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nOnce you have adjusted for inflation and PPP-adjustment, you can determine the increase in GDP per capita over time.

The number of Southern states that were in favor of integration is also not known, but it is estimated to be a significant number.
