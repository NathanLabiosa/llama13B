Friedman believed that businesses should not have a moral obligation to society, and that their role is to produce goods and services that people want at the lowest possible cost. He also believed that the government should not interfere with business activities, as long as they do not harm society.\nIn contrast, proponents of the stakeholder theory argue that businesses have a broader responsibility to society beyond just their shareholders. They believe that businesses should consider the interests of all of their stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, local communities, and the environment, when making decisions.

Clarity refers to the presentation of information, including the use of clear and concise language, and the avoidance of jargon or technical terms that may be difficult for stakeholders to understand. Accuracy refers to the accuracy and reliability of the information that is disclosed, including the avoidance of misleading or false information.\n\nThese three criteria provide a useful framework for evaluating the quality of corporate transparency and can help to ensure that stakeholders have access to the information they need to make informed decisions about a company's operations and performance."}

This can be done by intentionally obscuring the true cost of the product or service, but it is not the same as predatory pricing, deceptive pricing, or price fixing.\nPredatory pricing occurs when a company intentionally prices a product or service below its cost in order to drive competitors out of the market, and then later raises the price to monopolize the market. Deceptive pricing refers to a pricing strategy that is deceptive to consumers, such as advertising a price that is not reflective of the actual cost of the product or service. Price fixing is an illegal practice where companies agree to fix prices for goods or services."}

For example, if a company is required to invest in pollution-control technology in order to meet environmental regulations, this can increase their production costs. If the company's products or services are not priced competitively, the increased production costs can decrease their revenue.\nAnother way in which better environmental performance can decrease revenue is by leading to a negative perception among customers or stakeholders. For example, if a company's environmental performance is poor, it can damage their reputation and lead to a loss of customers or clients. This can also decrease their revenue."}
