One of the key challenges that developing countries face in taking advantage of the potential of globalisation for advancing food security is the presence of subsidies and trade barriers in wealthy countries that make it difficult for them to compete in the global marketplace. These subsidies and trade barriers can make it difficult for developing countries to access markets and resources, and can also make it difficult for them to produce and export their own agricultural products. Additionally, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) does not cover agriculture, which means that globalisation has not been subject to the same regulatory framework as other sectors. This lack of regulation has made it easier for multinational corporations to dominate the global food system, which can have negative impacts on food security and the livelihoods of small-scale farmers. Finally, supermarkets are one of the ways in which"}

{"question": "It is correct to state about the epidemiology of Anorexia Nervosa that:\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Females are three times more affected than males"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It never happens in children or post menopausal women"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Males from any socioeconomic background can be affected"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Prevalence rates are 2% for female adolescents"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) It never happens in children or post menopausal women.\nIt is not correct to state that females are three times more affected than males, and it is also not correct to state that males from any socioeconomic background can be affected, as the prevalence rates for males are much lower than for females. Additionally, it is not correct to state that anorexia never occurs in children or postmenopausal women, as it can in fact occur in both of these age groups."}
{"question": "What should elite athletes ideally consume during prolonged high intensity exercise (>2.5 hours)?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "60 g glucose per hour"}, {"label": "B", "text": "60 g glucose plus fructose per hour"}, {"label": "C", "text": "90 g glucose per hour"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90 g glucose plus fructose per hour"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) 60 g glucose per hour.\nResearch has shown that a sustained intake of 60 g of glucose per hour during prolonged high-intensity exercise can help maintain blood glucose levels, prevent hypoglycemia, and improve performance. This is because glucose is the primary source of energy for the body, and providing a steady supply of glucose during exercise can help the body maintain its energy levels and performance.\nIn contrast, providing a mixture of glucose and fructose (such as in choice B or C) has not been shown to provide any additional benefits and may even have a negative impact on performance.\nIt's worth noting that individual needs and tolerances may vary, so it's important to consult with a healthcare professional or sports nutritionist to determine the best strategy for meeting an athlete's specific needs and goals."}
{"question": "What endogenous substrate source provides the most energy during moderate to high intensity exercise?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Liver glycogen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Muscle glycogen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Intramuscular lipid"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Adipose tissue lipid"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) Liver glycogen.\nDuring moderate to high intensity exercise, the liver is the primary source of energy because it is the most readily available and easily accessible source of energy for the body. The liver stores glycogen, a complex carbohydrate that can be rapidly converted into glucose, which is the body's main source of energy. Muscle glycogen and intramuscular lipid are also sources of energy, but they are not as readily available as liver glycogen. Adipose tissue lipid is a source of energy, but it is not a primary source during moderate to high intensity exercise."}

It is different from non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), which includes all physical activities that are not specifically planned or structured, such as fidgeting, walking to a nearby room, and other small movements.\nPhysical activity (non-resting) energy expenditure refers to the energy expended during exercise and other forms of physical activity not associated with standing or walking. Basal metabolic rate, on the other hand, refers to the energy expended by the body in order to maintain basic physiological functions, such as breathing, digestion, and heartbeat, at rest."}
{"question": "Are most developing-country farmers engaged in subsistence or commercial production?\n", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Almost all are subsistence farmers."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Very few engage in subsistence production, instead selling almost all of their produce on the market."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Virtually all small-scale producers are engage in some self-provisioning and market sales."}, {"label": "D", "text": "37% engage in pure subsistence production."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Virtually all small-scale producers are engaged in some self-provisioning and market sales.\nThe question asks about the level of engagement in subsistence and commercial production among developing-country farmers. Choice A implies that almost all farmers are subsistence farmers, which is not accurate. Choice B suggests that very few farmers engage in subsistence production, while selling almost all of their produce on the market, which is also not accurate. Choice C suggests that virtually all small-scale producers are engaged in some form of self-provisioning and market sales, which is a more accurate description of the situation.\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the vast majority of small-scale farmers in developing countries are engaged in mixed farming systems, which include both subsistence and market-oriented production. This means that they may sell some of their produce on the market, but they also consume a significant portion for their own use. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Virtually all small-scale producers are engaged in some self-provisioning and market sales."}
