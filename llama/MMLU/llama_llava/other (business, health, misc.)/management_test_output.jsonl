It measures the degree of competition among existing firms in an industry. If the level of rivalry is high, it means that there are many firms competing for the same customers and resources, and the profitability for all firms is likely to be lower. Conversely, if the level of rivalry is low, there are fewer competitors, and the firms may be able to charge higher prices and enjoy higher profits.\nThe other four forces also"}

Strategy formulation is the process of creating a long-term plan for the organization that outlines its mission, vision, goals, and objectives. Functional planning is the process of breaking down an organization's goals into smaller, more manageable tasks and projects."}

Frank Gilbreth is most noted for his work on time and motion studies, which is the study of how people and machines can be made more efficient by analyzing and improving the way they do their work. This involved breaking down tasks into their smallest components and optimizing the order in which they were performed. This work was a major contributor to the field of industrial engineering and is still used today in many industries to improve productivity and efficiency."}

Scenario planning involves creating and analyzing different potential outcomes, or scenarios, to help organizations prepare for and respond to a wide range of possibilities. This can include everything from natural disasters and supply chain disruptions to economic downturns and political instability.\nScenario planning is often used in the context of business continuity planning, which is the process of identifying and preparing for potential disruptions to an organization's operations. By identifying and planning for potential risks and situations, organizations can better protect themselves from the impacts of unexpected events and ensure that they can continue to function and serve their customers in the event of a disruption.\nSynergy planning, ad hoc planning, and business level planning are not correct answers for the question."}

It is during this stage that the group begins to reach consensus on decisions and agreements.\nThe other choices, (A) storming, (B) performing, and (C) forming, are all part of Tuckman's model but are earlier stages of group development. Storming is the stage when members of the group begin to assert their own opinions and needs, which can lead to conflict and disagreement. Performing is the stage when the group is functioning well as a team and is able to achieve its goals efficiently. Forming is the stage when the group is first coming together and members are getting to know each other and forming relationships.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Norming, which is the stage where the group begins to develop its norms and rules and reach consensus on decisions and agreements."}
