Nociception, or the perception of pain, decussates in the medial lemniscus, which is a part of the brainstem that receives input from sensory receptors in the body. Discriminative touch, or the ability to feel different types of touch, decussates in the lateral lemniscus, which is a part of the brainstem that receives input from the thalamus. Skilled movements, such as those involved in walking, writing, and playing a musical instrument, are thought to decussate in the pyramids."}

The buccal surfaces are the surfaces of the teeth that contact the inner side of the cheeks when biting, and plaque can build up on these surfaces due to the difficulty in reaching them with a toothbrush and floss. The labial surfaces of the lower incisors are also prone to plaque buildup because these surfaces are exposed to the lips, which can harbor bacteria that can cause plaque buildup.\nAdditionally, the palatal surfaces of the upper molars and lingual surfaces of the lower incisors are less likely to accumulate plaque due to their location and difficulty in access.

The lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve provides sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, which includes the front, middle, and tip of the tongue. Damage to this nerve can cause a loss of sensation in the affected area, which can be accompanied by other symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or altered taste sensation.\nThe other options (B) chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, (C) lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve, and (D) hypoglossal nerve, do not match the symptoms described in the question."}
{"question": "In men, specimens for gonococcal cultures are most commonly obtained from which of the following structures?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Anus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bladder"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Urethra"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Testicle"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Urethra. Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The urethra is the tube through which urine passes out of the body, and it is a common site for gonorrhea to be cultured. The anus, bladder, and testicle are not common sites for culturing gonorrhea."}
{"question": "Which of the following structures should be visible on a dental panoramic radiograph?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The mandibular canal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The mandibular canal and maxillary sinus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The mandibular canal, maxillary sinus and hard palate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The mandibular canal, maxillary sinus, hard palate and zygomatic arch"}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) The mandibular canal.\nThe mandibular canal is a narrow passageway that runs through the mandible (lower jaw) and contains the mandibular nerve, which is responsible for sensation and movement in the lower jaw and surrounding muscles. It is a common structure to be visible on a dental panoramic radiograph.\nThe mandibular canal and maxillary sinus are two different structures and are not part of the same canal. The maxillary sinus is a cavity within the maxilla (upper jaw) that is lined with mucous membranes and is filled with air. It is also commonly visible on a dental panoramic radiograph.\nThe mandibular canal, maxillary sinus, hard palate and zygomatic arch are all different structures and are not part of the same canal or visible on the same radiograph.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) The mandibular canal."}
