The HM approach to sectoral security analysis agrees with the idea that security can be viewed using a sectoral framework, and recognizes the depth of analysis that is enabled by such an approach. This means that the framework accepts the idea that security can be analyzed through different lenses or sectors such as economic, political, social, and military. The HM approach is not against the Buzan et al.'s theory of sectoral security analysis, but rather, it recognizes the importance of using a sectoral approach to analyze security in a more comprehensive and holistic manner."}

This means that the state is the primary unit of analysis in the study of International Relations, and that other actors such as non-state actors, international organizations, and non-state actors do not play a significant role in the international system.\nSo, option A is incorrect because it suggests that international politics is not the same everywhere, and that it is only 'realist' in certain places at certain times. This goes against the idea that states are the primary unit of analysis and that they act as rational and self-interested actors in the international system. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that the nation state does not exist as a unitary actor within the international system.

Deepening and broadening of security refers to the expansion and evolution of the concept of security beyond traditional military and political concerns to include new areas such as economic, environmental, and social aspects. The nexus between identity and security is an example of a broadening of security, while war, the military, and the sovereign state are examples of deepening of security, as the concept of security is being expanded to include the role of the military and the sovereign state in ensuring security.

The recent global economic crisis can be seen as a challenge to this perspective because it highlights the limitations of the free market system and the need for more government intervention and international cooperation to prevent economic collapse and contagion. The crisis showed that government regulation and oversight of financial markets is necessary to prevent catastrophic failures, and that international cooperation is needed to address global economic issues. The failure of international cooperation to prevent the crisis can also be seen as a challenge to the liberalist perspective, which emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and limited government intervention."}

In order to effectively manage the risks and challenges associated with nuclear weapons, it was necessary to develop new institutions, including institutions for security studies, that could help guide decision-making and provide the necessary expertise. The need for these institutions was driven by the complex and rapidly changing nature of nuclear technology, which required a high degree of coordination and expertise.\nThis is reflected in the A and B answer choices. A suggests that civilian expertise was necessary because of the need for fast-changing technologies, while B suggests that nuclear technology was inherently more empirical and required a strong military leadership to coordinate planning. However, these factors were not as important as the need for a strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political, and military planning in the context of nuclear weapons.\nIt is important to note that the need for security studies institutions was not limited to the Cold War era, but has continued to evolve over time in response to new challenges and technologies."}

Option D is incorrect because it describes Western power and Eurocentric perceptions rather than the international itself.\nOption (B) is the correct answer because it describes the international as a space generated by the knowledge and practice of Western powers to favor the so-called third world. The term \"thick space\" refers to the idea that the international is not a simple or uniform space, but rather a complex and densely interconnected space that is shaped by a variety of factors, including political, economic, social, military, and cultural relations.

Hegemonic ethnicity refers to the dominant ethnic group within a society, which often has a disproportionate amount of power and influence.\nIt is important to note that these concepts are interconnected and can interact in complex ways. For example, a nation-state's sovereignty can be threatened if its identity is weak or if it is dominated by a hegemonic ethnic group. Likewise, a society's identity can be strengthened if its sovereignty is maintained, and a hegemonic ethnic group can be more secure if its identity is strong.\nTherefore, all of these options are essential to societal security, and none of them can be ignored or undervalued if a society is to remain stable and secure."}

Non-state actors, including illegal groups, are also key players.\nThe defence trade is the business of selling and acquiring military equipment and technologies. It involves a wide range of actors, including state-level military organizations, defense contractors, and private companies. Non-state actors, such as arms dealers and criminal organizations, are also involved in the defense trade. These non-state actors may engage in illegal activities such as smuggling, trafficking, and selling weapons and small arms on the black market.\nIt is important to note that the defense trade is regulated by international law, including the arms trade treaty (ATT), which aims to prevent the diversion of arms to terrorists and other unauthorized recipients. The ATT has been signed by 104 countries and is legally binding for those who have ratified it."}

The negativity attached to HM during the Cold War restricted the prominence of HM at this time, excluding it from mainstream security studies.\nThe correct answer is choice C.\nThis statement accurately describes the historical context in which the development of HM as a paradigm within security studies took place. During the Cold War, HM was seen as a negative concept and was not considered a mainstream area of study in security studies. This was due to the ideological and political differences between the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, which made the concept of human security seem irrelevant and even hostile. However, as the Cold War came to an end, the security landscape changed, and the focus shifted from the ideological and political differences to more practical and relevant security issues. This allowed for the gradual inclusion of HM into security dialogue, making it one of the main paradigms within security studies."}

While it is important to recognize and act on instances of cyber warfare, it is also important to accept that there can be no absolute security, and to focus on building resilience and reducing the threat. This means designing IT systems that are resistant to attack, and building international cooperation and information exchange to share data and resources and to build defenses against common threats.\nBy accepting that there can be no absolute security, organizations can focus on designing resilient systems that are less vulnerable to attack, and on building international cooperation to share information and resources. This will help to reduce the overall threat and increase the resilience of the systems and networks that are critical to our national and global security."}

Arms control is typically used in the context of traditional military weapons, and its application to cyber-security is limited due to the unique characteristics of cyber threats. Cyber-security threats are not physical or tangible, and are difficult to measure or monitor in the same way as traditional weapons. Additionally, cyber-security threats can originate from anywhere in the world, making it difficult to enforce international agreements. Therefore, it is unlikely that arms control strategies would be effective in managing cyber-security threats."}

While inequality can contribute to social unrest, it does not necessarily lead to revolutionary uprisings or military conflict. In fact, many countries with high levels of inequality have low levels of political instability and conflict.\nIt's also worth noting that the effects of inequality can be mitigated and managed through effective policies and programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality, such as social welfare programs, job training, and education. These policies can help to narrow the gap between rich and poor, and reduce the likelihood of social unrest and conflict.\nIn summary, while inequality can have negative effects on global security, it is not necessarily a direct threat to global security in the traditional sense of military conflict or political instability.
