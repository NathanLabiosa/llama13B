Choice (B) is incorrect because means are approximately normal, so we can use them to make z-scores. Choice (C) is incorrect because the sampling distribution of sample means is also approximately normal, so we can use z-scores for inference procedures for means. Choice (D) is also incorrect because it states that more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic when using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, which has nothing to do with the use of z-scores for inference procedures for means."}

This technique involves dividing the population into strata (groups) based on certain characteristics, such as age, gender, or location, and then randomly selecting a sample from each stratum. This can help to reduce bias in a sample survey by ensuring that the sample is representative of the population as a whole.\nOn the other hand, (A) Following up with those who did not respond to the survey the first time may not necessarily reduce bias, as those who did not respond may have different characteristics than those who did. (B) Asking questions in a neutral manner is important, but it may not be enough to eliminate bias entirely. (D) Selecting samples randomly is important, but it may not be sufficient to reduce bias in a sample survey if the population is not representative.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C), using stratified random sampling."}

Therefore, the statement \"In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the sampled mean weight of the oranges\" is not true.\nOn the other hand, the statement \"Ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces\" is true. This is because the confidence interval is a range of values that is calculated based on the sample weights. It represents the range of weights that we would expect to find if we repeated the same sampling procedure many times. Since the sample weighed 50 oranges, the range of weights within which we would expect to find 95 percent of"}

Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be narrower than that using 15 observations.\n\nThe mean and standard deviation of a sample are used to calculate the confidence interval, which represents the range of values within which the true population mean probably falls. The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the estimate of the population mean is. Therefore, it is advantageous to take more observations, as this will result in a narrower confidence interval and a more precise estimate of the population mean.\n\nThe statement \"Because the mean and the standard deviation are about the same, the confidence interval computed using 35 observations should be approximately the same as that computed using 15 observations.\" is not correct. The mean and standard deviation are not the same thing and they cannot be used interchangeably to calculate a confidence interval.

Therefore, it is logical to block on exercise level, which is the variable that is associated with cholesterol level. If gender is not associated with cholesterol level, then it is not a relevant variable to block on. Similarly, if the type of drug is not associated with cholesterol level, then it is not a relevant variable to block on.\nIt is important to note that this is just one example of a possible block design, and there may be other valid block designs that are not mentioned in the question. The key is to choose a block design that takes into account the variables that are relevant to the study and that maximizes the power of the study."}

By blocking on exercise intensity, the experiment can determine whether taking fish oil or garlic capsules has more of an effect on cholesterol levels, while controlling for the potential confounding variable of exercise intensity. Blocking on sleep length or cholesterol level would not be appropriate as they are not associated with cholesterol levels. Blocking on capsule type would not be useful as it is not expected to have an impact on cholesterol levels.\nIt is important to note that blocking on all three variables (exercise intensity, sleep length, and cholesterol level) would not be feasible, as it would be impossible to control for all variables in an experimental setting. Therefore, the researcher should choose one variable to block on and control for the others. In this case, blocking on exercise intensity makes the most sense as it is the most relevant variable to the study question."}

In a linear regression model, the residuals are expected to have a mean of zero, which means that the errors in the model are expected to cancel out and the overall relationship should be linear.\nOption (A) is incorrect because influential scores have large residuals. An influential point is a point in the data that has a large impact on the regression line, even if it is not the most extreme point. Influential points can have either large positive or negative residuals, and they can cause the regression line to deviate from the true relationship.\nOption (B) is incorrect because the number of positive residuals and negative residuals should be the same. A linear regression model assumes that the errors in the model are independent and identically distributed, meaning that the errors in the model have the same distribution and follow a normal distribution.\nOption (D) is incorrect because if the correlation is 0, there is no relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.

For example, other factors such as the amount of homework, extracurricular activities, or the quality of the school's curricula could also play a role in the students' academic performance. The experiment does not control for these variables, which could lead to a false conclusion about the effect of reading on GPA.

Blocking is a technique used in experimental designs to reduce confounding, which is when variables other than the independent variable (IV) affect the dependent variable (DV) in the experiment. Blocking prevents subjects from being randomly assigned to different treatments based on their characteristics, such as age, sex, or previous exposure to the treatment, which can lead to confounding. Blocking can be done by grouping subjects into different blocks based on these characteristics, and then randomly assigning them to different treatments within each block. This reduces the likelihood of confounding, and leads to more accurate and reliable experimental results."}

The minimum sample size needed to achieve a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 2.5% is 40. This is because 40 is the square root of 0.95^2. This formula is used to calculate the sample size needed for a confidence interval, assuming that the margin of error is a certain percentage of the population value. The confidence level is the probability that the sample will contain the true population value, and the margin of error is the maximum difference between the estimated population value and the true population value that is still considered accurate. So, the formula is:\nn = sqrt[(1 / (1 - (1 - confidence level)^2))]\nwhere n is the minimum sample size needed, and confidence level is the probability that the sample will contain the true population value.\nIn this case, the confidence level is 95%, so the formula becomes:\nn = sqrt[(1 / (1 - 0.95^2))]\nn = sqrt(1 / (1 - 0.95^2)) = sqrt(1 / 0.05) = sqrt(5"}

This means that the results of the survey may not accurately reflect the views of the population as a whole. However, if the sample is selected randomly and is representative of the population, sampling error can be effectively eliminated.\nIn observational studies, there is a risk of bias and confounding variables, which can influence responses. In experiments, the treatments are carefully planned to result in responses that are as similar as possible, but the results may not generalize to the real world.\nTherefore, the statement that \"sampling error is effectively eliminated\" in a well-designed, well-conducted sample survey is a true statement."}
