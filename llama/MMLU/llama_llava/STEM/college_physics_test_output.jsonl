{"question": "White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33). A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle.

The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection for normal incidence. However, when a thin layer of oil is added to the water, the refractive index of the oil is higher than that of the water, causing the angle of incidence to be less than the angle of reflection. This means that the light is internally reflected inside the oil layer.\nWhen the light reaches the boundary between the oil and the water, it is refracted by the water and continues to propagate. Since the light is now in a medium with a lower refractive index, it is bent towards the normal and the angle of incidence increases. This causes the light to be reflected towards the air, where it is absorbed or transmitted.\nThe wavelength of light that is most strongly reflected is the one that is closest to the angle of incidence at the boundary between the oil and water. Since the angle of incidence at this boundary is larger than the angle of reflection, the light is most strongly reflected at 650 n"}

This is because the time required for one revolution of the satellite is proportional to the square root of the radius of the orbit, which is directly related to the mass of the planet.\n\nThe orbit of a satellite around a planet is determined by the gravitational force acting on the satellite. The gravitational force between two masses, m and M, is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the time required for one revolution of the satellite is inversely proportional to the square root of the radius of the orbit.\n\nTherefore, the time required for one revolution of the satellite is proportional to R^(3/2). This means that if the mass of the planet is increased, the radius of the orbit will also increase, and the time required for one revolution of the satellite will decrease."}
