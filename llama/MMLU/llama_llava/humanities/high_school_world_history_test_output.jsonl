{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms."}, {"label": "B", "text": "can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India."}, {"label": "C", "text": "should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression."}, {"label": "D", "text": "seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "C. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nThe second paragraph of the passage states that the revolt of 1857 involved an insurrection against British rule in India, and that the revolt was a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Killing of civilians during wartime"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The passages above primarily describe the violence perpetrated by British soldiers during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Indian Mutiny.

The passage states that the national plan advanced by Nkrumah is based on co-operation with all States, regardless of their economic system, and that the issue is not the return on investment for foreign investors, but rather the question of power. This suggests that Nkrumah's approach is influenced by a belief in social Darwinism, the idea that societies and countries should compete and survive based on their own merits and resources, rather than being influenced by external forces. This aligns with the concept of nationalism and self-determination, which are core principles of social Darwinism."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

While the passage doesn't explicitly mention the slave trade, it does mention that there are pagan nations in Mansa Musa's kingdom that he doesn't collect the tribute (jizya) from, but simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits.

Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.

It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

The passage also mentions that the slave traders were commanded by religious leaders who gave them the permission to commit such crimes against non-Muslims under the guise of spreading Islam. Thus, the religious beliefs of the slave traders played a significant role in their actions and their treatment of non-Muslim Africans."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nWhether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices"}, {"label": "B", "text": "That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The first passage can be said to undermine the commonly held assumption that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. The passage suggests that there was a debate within the British Empire about whether to continue the practice of sati, which was a Hindu custom where a widow would immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre. While some believed it was a necessary evil to retain British control in India, others argued that it was morally reprehensible and should be abolished. This passage suggests that not all European colonizers were eager to force their cultural norms on native populations and that there was a debate within the British Empire about this issue."}

The most directly result of this speech was the call to arms by Christians in response to the capture of Jerusalem by the Seljuk Turks in 1071 C.E. The Pope's speech was a call to arms to reclaim the Holy Land for Christianity and to regain control of the trade routes. This led to the Crusades, which were military campaigns organized by Western Christianity to regain the Holy Land from Muslim control. The Crusades lasted for over 200 years and had a significant impact on the history of the region, including the conquest of Constantinople and the decline of Mediterranean trade routes.

This suggests that the custom of not veiling women may have been a part of the local culture in Mali. It was not a rebellion against the oppression of women in Islam, as the account does not indicate any indication of oppression or gender inequality.\nIt was also not due to the climate of Mali being too hot or impractical for veiling, as the account does not mention any such factors.

Nkrumah believed that the lack of union among African countries was preventing them from fully utilizing their resources and achieving their national aspirations.\nHowever, the spread of communism throughout the continent was a significant factor that prevented the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage. The Soviet Union, which was a major supporter of communism, had a significant influence in Africa, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. Many African countries were drawn to the ideology of communism, and some even established socialist governments. This led to a divide between pro-communist and non-communist African countries, and it made it difficult to achieve unity among African countries."}

The poet also describes the event as the classic event that demonstrates the will to oppress and the blood the rich lust after. The poem concludes with a call to remember the event and the unquenchable will for freedom and to be glad that the dead are remembered.\nThis suggests that the poet sees the incident as a powerful representation of the oppression in South Africa and the fear that the rest of the world might have towards it. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.\"\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.\nDuring the time period in which this text was written, who was allowed to participate in the Greek democratic process?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "All adult men born within the geographic boundaries of the state"}, {"label": "B", "text": "All adult men and women born within the geographic boundaries of the state"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All adult men who were citizens of the state by birth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All adult men and women who were citizens of the state by birth"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) All adult men who were citizens of the state by birth.\nDuring the time period in which this text was written, only male citizens who were born within the geographic boundaries of the state were allowed to participate in the democratic process in Greece.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.

Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the author is interested in obtaining furs from the natives as a means of maintaining control over them and as a way of securing the Company's trading monopoly."}

The King and Queen of Castile and Aragon, who were also the monarchs of the Spanish Empire, were likely motivated to secure Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line for several reasons. One of these reasons was that they believed it would be more difficult to conquer and colonize India than the New World.\nIndia was already a well-established civilization with a strong economy and a large population, while the New World was largely unexplored and uninhabited by European colonizers. The Spanish also believed that the native populations of the New World would be more receptive to Spanish rule and conversion to Catholicism, which would facilitate the Spanish expansion in the Americas.

The Spanish nobleman could require his Indians to furnish his table with the fruits of his ancestors. This indicates that the invaders brought these crops to the Americas and enslaved the local population to work on plantations, which led to the exchange of crops and food items between the Americas and Europe."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nWhether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe tone of the first passage best supports which of the following suppositions about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality."}, {"label": "D", "text": "They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The tone of the first passage best supports the supposition that the British were primarily motivated by a concern for their own authority and security in India. The passage states that the decision to eradicate the sati ritual is surrounded by an \"awful responsibility\" and that the British had a \"powerful neighbour\" and a \"supreme\" position in India, emphasizing their need to maintain control over the subcontinent. The passage also references the power of the British to influence Indian culture and customs, suggesting a more pragmatic approach rather than a principled one. Therefore, the statement \"The tone of the first passage best supports the supposition that the British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.\" is incorrect."}

This is in contrast to the competing ideologies of the Cold War (between the United States and the Soviet Union), which was the context of the quote from Kwame Nkrumah. The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Western Bloc (the United States, its allies, and their NATO allies) and the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its allies) after World War II. The quote from Kwame Nkrumah suggests that the struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world, but at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in a way that impoverishes the less developed.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.
