Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us.

He also mentions that the case is not just about Zenger or New York, but about the future of liberty in the British colonies.

The President Harry S. Truman in 1947 stated that the seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want, and that their growth is fostered by poverty and strife. He also mentioned that the hope of a people for a better life must be kept alive in order to prevent the spread of totalitarian regimes. The policy of containment was a strategy adopted by the United States to prevent the spread of communism and to limit the influence of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. This policy involved containing communist expansion, supporting anti-communist movements, and avoiding direct military confrontation with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) the policy of containment."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"If you analyze it I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism. I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves.

It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Christopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people."}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people.\nThe passage states that the Spanish conquistadors of the Americas \"merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition\" that led to a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse, and that this tradition was based on a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity.

The reservations were primarily related to the ceding of territory to Poland, which was considered by some to be too large and by others to be too small. The Senate did not reject the treaty because it treated Germany too leniently or because it required increased American involvement in European affairs.\nIt is important to note that the Treaty of Versailles was not approved by all of the countries involved in the war, including Germany. The treaty imposed significant financial and territorial penalties on Germany and was therefore widely criticized by German leaders.

The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.

Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence.

An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.\n\u2014President George Herbert Walker Bush, Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, September 11, 1990\nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush's vision of a \"new world order\" was most directly made possible by", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "American economic prosperity."}, {"label": "B", "text": "President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the Iranian Hostage Crisis."}, {"label": "D", "text": "the end of the Cold War."}], "answerKey": "D", "model_answer": "The correct answer is D. The end of the Cold War made President George Herbert Walker Bush's vision of a \"new world order\" possible. The Cold War was a state of geopolitical tension after World War II between the United States and its Western allies and the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc allies, characterized by proxy wars, espionage, and competitive strategic and conventional arms races. The end of the Cold War in the early 1990s led to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the bipolar world order of the Cold War era, paving the way for a new world order that was less divided and more cooperative. President Bush's speech and the ideas he expressed were part of this broader shift in global politics, and the end of the Cold War allowed these ideas to take shape and become a reality."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our American civilization\u2026.The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nWhich one of the following was an unintended consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Liberal Democrats abandoned anti-war protests in a show of support for President Johnson."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Conservative Republicans mobilized to defend traditional mores and curb government authority."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Economic recession catalyzed by increased government spending causing \"stagflation.\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "A majority of Northern black voters abandoned the Democrat party, siding with Republicans."}], "answerKey": "B", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Conservative Republicans mobilized to defend traditional mores and curb government authority.\nThis quote describes the successes of liberalism in the 1960s, including the passage of major civil rights legislation, the expansion of social welfare programs, and the promotion of a more just and equal society. However, the quote also notes that some conservative Republicans were mobilized to defend traditional mores and curb government authority, which was an unintended consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s.\nOption (A) Liberal Democrats abandoned anti-war protests in a show of support for President Johnson is incorrect because it does not address the unintended consequences of the liberal successes of the 1960s. Option (C) Economic recession caused by increased government spending causing \"stagflation\" is also incorrect because it does not address the unintended consequences of the liberal successes of the 1960s.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nLet us not, I beseech you sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.\u2026 It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!

These policies included the Boston Massacre, the Intolerable Acts, the Quebec Act, the Stamp Act, and the Tea Act, among others. These policies, combined with British control over the colonies through the British Parliament, led to a growing sense of frustration and resistance among many colonists. As a result of these policies and the growing tensions between the colonies and the British government, the American Revolution eventually broke out, leading to a conflict that would ultimately result in American independence."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nHere is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n\u2014Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nRiis's work as an investigator of the lives of the poor can most directly be associated with which of the following?", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yellow Journalism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Abolitionism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The muckrakers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Socialism"}], "answerKey": "C", "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) The muckrakers.\nJacob Riis was a muckraker, a journalist and social reformer who exposed social and economic injustices in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
