When an object is at a higher elevation, it has more GPE than when it is at a lower elevation. As the skydiver jumps out of the plane, she gains GPE due to her increased distance from the Earth's surface. However, as she opens up her parachute and drifts toward the flat ground, she loses GPE due to her decreased distance from the Earth's surface. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the skydiver and Earth decreases as she drifts toward the flat ground.\n\nThis decrease in GPE can be explained using the following steps:\n\n1. The skydiver jumps out of the plane and gains GPE due to her increased distance from the Earth's surface.\n2.

Objects with higher temperatures have more thermal energy than objects with lower temperatures. Therefore, a 175-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 65\u00b0F will have more thermal energy than a 175-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 40\u00b0F.\n\nTo determine which object has more thermal energy, we can use the formula for thermal energy:\n\nThermal Energy (E) = m x c x T\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object, c is the specific heat capacity of the object, and T is the temperature of the object.\n\nFor a 175-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 65\u00b0F, the thermal energy can be calculated as follows:\n\nE = m x c x T = 17",

In each pair of magnets shown, the magnets are made of the same material and have the same strength. However, some of the magnets are different sizes.\n\nTo determine the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, we can use the formula:\n\nF = k \\* (m1 \\* m2) / d^3\n\nwhere F is the magnetic force, k is the magnetic constant, m1 and m2 are the magnetic moments of the two magnets, and d is the distance between them.\n\nSince all the magnets shown are made of the same material and have the same strength, the magnetic constant k is the same for all the magnets.

    "7119": "SOLUTION: To determine which block has more thermal energy, we need to consider the heat capacity of each block. Heat capacity is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a substance by one degree Celsius (or one degree Fahrenheit). The heat capacity of an object depends on its mass and the specific heat capacity of the substance it is made of.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of an object is the amount of heat energy required to raise its temperature by one degree Celsius (or one degree Fahrenheit) per unit of mass. For example, water has a specific heat capacity of about 4.18 joules per gram per degree Celsius (or 0.25 joules per gram per degree Fahrenheit), while iron has a specific heat capacity of about 0.38 joules per gram per degree Celsius (or 0.26 joules per gram per degree Fahrenheit).\n\nTherefore, if two blocks of iron have the same specific heat capacity, they will both require the same amount of heat energy to raise their temperature by one degree Celsius (or one degree Fahrenheit) per unit of mass.",

    "17611": "Answers: (A) Both are caused by heating.\n\nExplanation: The two changes mentioned in the text are melting wax and rain forming in a cloud. Both of these changes are caused by heating.\n\nMelting wax is a physical change that occurs when the temperature of the wax is increased, causing its molecular bonds to weaken and eventually break. This results in the wax becoming a liquid state, known as melting.\n\nRain forming in a cloud is also a physical change caused by heating. Water droplets in the clouds absorb heat energy from the sun or the Earth's surface, causing them to vaporize and rise into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises, it cools, and the water droplets condense back into liquid form, resulting in the formation of raindrops.\n\nTherefore, both melting wax and rain forming in a cloud are caused by heating, making option (A) the correct answer."
