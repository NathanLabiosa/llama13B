{"question_id": "3153", "prompt": "Which of the following could Robert's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n<image>", "text": "Human: Which of the following could Robert's test show?\n The answer is Robert's test could show the movement and stability of the parachute with a 1 m vent at 200 km per hour in the wind tunnel.", "answer_id": "T6juEeTdrkNJmPXziCNkwL", "model_id": "llava13B", "metadata": {}}

The palm tree would require a larger area of space compared to the marigolds, and palm trees generally need more attention to factors such as sunlight, water, and soil conditions. Furthermore, maintaining a palm tree can be more costly than maintaining marigolds, as palm trees need regular fertilization, pest control, and pruning.
