The containers are filled with either sample A or sample B. To compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample, we would need to calculate the total energy of the particles in each container.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two Syrian hamsters.\nOptions: (A) 3/4 (B) 2/4 (C) 4/4 (D) 0/4 (E) 1/4\n<image>", "text": "Assistant: Given that the cross involves two Syrian hamsters with one having the dominant straight fur gene and the other having the recessive wavy fur gene, the probability of a offspring having wavy fur is 0. In the Punnett square, the possible genotypes and resulting phenotypes are:\n(FF) - Straight fur\n(FF) - Straight fur\n(Ff) - Wavy fur (1/4)\n(fF) - Wavy fur\n(ff) - Wavy fur\nSince the cross involves two individuals with the same dominant allele (F), none of the offspring will have wavy fur. The only possible genotypes and phenotypes in this case are (FF) - Straight fur.
