In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).\nA certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene.\nOptions: (A) white flowers (B) red flowers"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\n###\nANSWER: A."}], "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Based on the given information, the phenotype of the plant with the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene is (B) red flowers.\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n1. The scarlet rosemallow plant has two alleles for the flower color gene, F and f.\n2. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).\n3. A certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene, meaning it has two copies of the dominant allele (F).\n4. Since the dominant allele (F) is present in the homozygous genotype (ff), the plant will have red flowers.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype of the plant with the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene is (B) red flowers."}

In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two muskmelon plants.\nOptions: (A) 4:0 (B) 0:4 (C) 3:1 (D) 2:2 (E) 1:3\n<image>"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n\nSOLUTION: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sweet fruit or sour fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.\nSweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene.

So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.

Since the allele for sour fruit is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit, the offspring will inherit the allele for sour fruit from one parent and the allele for sweet fruit from the other parent.\nTo calculate the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which states that in a population with no selection or mutation, the genotype frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next.\nIn this case, the genotype frequencies for the muskmelon plants are as follows:\nGenotype | Frequency\n---|---\nf/f | 0.5\nF/f | 0.5\nf/F | 0.25\nF/F | 0.25\n\nUsing the Hardy-Wein"}

Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.\nAn organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.\nAn organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.\nSOLUTION: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bilberry.\nNo arrow points to the lichen. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the lichen.\nNo arrow points to the bear sedge. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the bear sedge.\nThere are two arrows pointing to the collared lemming. One arrow starts from the bear sedge, and the other arrow starts from the lichen. Neither the bear sedge nor the lichen has an arrow pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the collared lemming.\n###\nANSWER: B."}], "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The organism that contains matter that was once part of the bilberry is (A) collared lemming.\nExplanation: Collared lemming is a herbivore that feeds on lichens, which are a type of organism that contains matter that was once part of the bilberry. Lichens are a composite organism made up of a fungus and an alga or a bacterium. Bilberries are a type of berry that can be found in tundra ecosystems and are an important food source for many animals, including the collared lemming."}

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.

In this group, the gene for the stem height trait has two alleles. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h).\nA certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype hh for the stem height gene.\nOptions: (A) a short stem (B) a tall stem"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The pea plant's genotype for the stem height gene is hh. The pea plant's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for a short stem. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nThe pea plant's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.\n###\nANSWER: A."}], "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The phenotype of the plant with the homozygous genotype hh for the stem height gene would be a tall stem.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe phenotype of an organism is the physical expression of its genotype. In this case, the genotype of the plant is hh, which means it has two copies of the allele for a tall stem (H). Since the allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h), the plant's phenotype for the stem height trait would be a tall stem.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) a tall stem."}

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\nSOLUTION: Step 1: Think about each change.\nWater evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.\nRain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change.

The condensed water droplets then fall back to the Earth's surface as rain or snow.\n\nTherefore, both water evaporating from a puddle and rain forming in a cloud are caused by heating.

Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position in relation to a gravitational force, such as the Earth's gravity.

Chester has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.\nOptions: (A) rough fur (B) soft fur"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Chester's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Chester's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for soft fur. So, Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Chester's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for soft fur (f) is recessive to the allele for rough fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nChester's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles.

The water is the solvent.\nThe concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.\nconcentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent\nSOLUTION: In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.\nUse the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.\nSolution A and Solution B have the same number of blue particles per milliliter.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling.

So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.\nThe amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth.

When an object is at a higher elevation, it has more GPE than when it is at a lower elevation. As the skydiver jumps out of the plane, she gains GPE due to her increased distance from the Earth's surface. However, as she opens up her parachute and drifts toward the flat ground, she loses GPE due to her decreased distance from the Earth's surface. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the skydiver and Earth decreases as she drifts toward the flat ground.\n\nThis decrease in GPE can be explained using the following steps:\n\n1. The skydiver jumps out of the plane and gains GPE due to her increased distance from the Earth's surface.\n2.

A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape.

Ringo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene.\nOptions: (A) black fur (B) brown fur"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Ringo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for brown fur. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Ringo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nRingo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur.\n###\nANSWER: B."}], "model_answer": "SOLUTION: Ringo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene.

So, in this food web, matter does not move from the sea cucumber to the bat star..\n###\nANSWER: C."}], "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The organism that contains matter that eventually moves to the bat star is the phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are tiny, single-celled plants that live in the ocean's surface waters. They use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through a process called photosynthesis.\n\nPhytoplankton are eaten by smaller organisms such as zooplankton, which are small animals that feed on phytoplankton and other microscopic organisms. Zooplankton are then eaten by larger organisms such as fish, squid, and other sea creatures.\n\nThe bat star is a predator that feeds on other sea creatures such as fish, squid, and crustaceans. In this food web, the matter consumed by the bat star originated from the phytoplankton, which were eaten by the zooplankton, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) sea cucumber, (B) sea otter, and (C) phytoplankton."}

This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.\nYou grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.\nBy comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.\nSOLUTION: In this experiment, Luther investigated whether baking soda can remove crayon from a wall. The sections of wall scrubbed with water only did not get baking soda.

He says, \"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.\" Scholars have long debated the exact meaning of the phrase, but many claim that Job is saying that he narrowly escaped death.\nThe allusion by the skin of his teeth means just barely.\n###\nANSWER: A."}], "model_answer": "SOLUTION: The source of the allusion in the sentence \"Ben got off the mountain by the skin of his teeth\" is the Bible.\nThe phrase \"by the skin of his teeth\" originated from a story in the Bible's Book of Job (Job 19:20), where Job says, \"Oh, that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!\" In this context, Job is expressing his deep sadness and despair over the loss of his family and possessions. The phrase \"by the skin of his teeth\" has since been used metaphorically to describe a narrow escape or a close call, as in the sentence \"Ben got off the mountain by the skin of his teeth.\"\n\nIn summary, the source of the allusion in the sentence \"Ben got off the mountain by the skin of his teeth\" is the Bible's Book of Job, where the phrase \"by the skin of his teeth\" originated as a metaphor for a narrow escape or a close call."}

(B) Both are chemical changes. (C) Both are caused by cooling. (D) Both are only physical changes."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.\nSOLUTION: Step 1: Think about each change.\nMelting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.\nRain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. These droplets make up a cloud. When there is enough water in the air, the droplets will fall as rain.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes.

But melting wax is not.\n###\nANSWER: D."}], "model_answer": "Answers: (A) Both are caused by heating.\n\nExplanation: The two changes mentioned in the text are melting wax and rain forming in a cloud. Both of these changes are caused by heating.\n\nMelting wax is a physical change that occurs when the temperature of the wax is increased, causing its molecular bonds to weaken and eventually break. This results in the wax becoming a liquid state, known as melting.\n\nRain forming in a cloud is also a physical change caused by heating. Water droplets in the clouds absorb heat energy from the sun or the Earth's surface, causing them to vaporize and rise into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises, it cools, and the water droplets condense back into liquid form, resulting in the formation of raindrops.\n\nTherefore, both melting wax and rain forming in a cloud are caused by heating, making option (A) the correct answer."}
