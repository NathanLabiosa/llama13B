In this case, you might test your hypothesis by taking your dog to the veterinarian. The veterinarian can check your dog for fleas.\nThe fifth step is to analyze your results. In this case, you might find out that your dog does not have fleas.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion.

An observation is something that you notice. For example, you might notice that your dog is scratching a lot. You might also notice that your dog is losing hair.\nThe next step is to ask a question. You might ask, \"Why is my dog scratching and losing hair?\"\nThe third step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an educated guess. You might guess that your dog is scratching and losing hair because he has fleas.\nThe fourth step is to test your hypothesis. You might test your hypothesis by taking your dog to the vet. The vet might tell you that your dog has fleas.\nThe fifth step is to analyze your results. You might analyze your results by looking at your dog's skin. You might see that your dog's skin is red and irritated.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion. You might conclude that your dog has fleas.\nThe seventh step is to communicate your results. You might tell your parents that your dog has fleas.\nOptions: (A",

An observation is a description of something that you see or experience. For example, you might observe that a plant is growing in a certain place.\nThe next step is to ask a question. A question is a sentence that asks about something that you want to learn. For example, you might ask, \"Why is the plant growing in that place?\"\nThe next step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a possible answer to your question. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant is growing in that place because it gets a lot of sunlight there.\nThe next step is to test your hypothesis. To test your hypothesis, you must do an experiment. An experiment is a procedure that you follow to test your hypothesis. For example, you might move the plant to a place that gets less sunlight. If the plant dies, then your hypothesis is incorrect. If the plant lives, then your hypothesis is correct.\nThe final step is to draw a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that explains what you learned from your experiment. For example, you might conclude that the plant needs a lot of sunlight to live.\nOptions: (A) The scientific method is a series of steps that scientists follow to learn about the world.

An observation is a description of something that you see or experience. For example, you might observe that a plant is growing in a certain way.\nThe next step is to ask a question about the observation. For example, you might ask why the plant is growing in that way.\nThe third step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a possible explanation for the observation. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant is growing in that way because it is getting too much sunlight.\nThe fourth step is to test the hypothesis. To test the hypothesis, you must design an experiment. An experiment is a procedure that tests a hypothesis. For example, you might design an experiment to test whether the plant is getting too much sunlight.\nThe fifth step is to analyze the results of the experiment. To analyze the results, you must collect data. Data are facts and figures that are collected during an experiment. For example, you might collect data on how much sunlight the plant is getting.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that explains what you have learned from the experiment. For example, you might conclude that the plant is growing in that way because it is getting too much sunlight.\nOptions: (A) The scientific method is a series of steps that scientists use to solve problems.

An observation is something you notice. For example, you might notice that your dog is scratching a lot.\nThe next step is to ask a question. You might ask, \"Why is my dog scratching so much?\"\nThe third step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an educated guess. You might guess that your dog is scratching because he has fleas.\nThe fourth step is to test your hypothesis. You might test your hypothesis by taking your dog to the vet. The vet can tell you if your dog has fleas.\nThe fifth step is to analyze your results. If your dog has fleas, you can conclude that your hypothesis was correct. If your dog does not have fleas, you can conclude that your hypothesis was incorrect.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion. If your hypothesis was correct, you can conclude that your dog was scratching because he had fleas.

An observation is a description of something that you see or experience. For example, you might observe that a plant is growing in a pot.\nThe next step is to ask a question about the observation. For example, you might ask, \"How does the plant grow?\"\nThe third step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an educated guess about the answer to the question. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant grows because it is getting water and sunlight.\nThe fourth step is to test the hypothesis. To test the hypothesis, you would need to do an experiment. For example, you might put the plant in a dark closet for a week. If the plant stops growing, then you would know that your hypothesis was wrong.\nThe fifth step is to analyze the results of the experiment. If the plant stops growing, then you would know that your hypothesis was wrong. You would then need to form a new hypothesis and test it.\nThe sixth and final step is to draw a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that explains what you learned from the experiment. For example, you might conclude that the plant needs sunlight to grow.\nOptions: (A) The scientific method is a series of steps that scientists use to answer questions.

An observation is a description of something that you see or experience. For example, you might observe that a plant is growing in a certain place.\nThe next step is to ask a question. A question is a sentence that asks about something that you want to learn. For example, you might ask, \"Why is the plant growing in that place?\"\nThe third step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a possible answer to a question. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant is growing in that place because it gets a lot of sunlight there.\nThe fourth step is to test the hypothesis. To test a hypothesis, you must do an experiment. An experiment is a procedure that you follow to test a hypothesis. For example, you might move the plant to a place that gets less sunlight. If the plant dies, then your hypothesis is not correct. If the plant lives, then your hypothesis might be correct.\nThe fifth step is to analyze the data. Data are the results of an experiment. To analyze data, you must look at the data and think about what they mean. For example, if the plant dies when you move it to a place that gets less sunlight, then you know that the plant needs a lot of sunlight to live.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that answers the question. For example, you might conclude that the",

An observation is a description of something that you see or experience. For example, you might observe that a plant is growing in a pot.\nThe next step is to ask a question. A question is a sentence that asks about something that you want to learn. For example, you might ask, \"How does the plant grow?\"\nThe third step is to make a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a possible answer to your question. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant grows because it gets water and sunlight.\nThe fourth step is to test your hypothesis. To test your hypothesis, you must do an experiment. An experiment is a procedure that you follow to test your hypothesis. For example, you might do an experiment to see if the plant grows without water and sunlight.\nThe fifth step is to analyze your data. Data are the results of your experiment. To analyze your data, you must look at your data and think about what they mean. For example, you might analyze your data to see if the plant grew without water and sunlight.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that answers your",

An observation is a description of something that you see or experience. For example, you might observe that a plant is growing in a pot.\nThe next step is to ask a question about the observation. For example, you might ask, \"How does the plant grow?\"\nThe third step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an educated guess about the answer to the question. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant grows because it is getting water and sunlight.\nThe fourth step is to test the hypothesis. To test the hypothesis, you would need to do an experiment. For example, you might put the plant in a dark closet and see if it still grows.\nThe fifth step is to analyze the results of the experiment. For example, you might find that the plant does not grow in the dark closet.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that explains what you learned from the experiment. For example, you might conclude that the plant needs sunlight to grow.\nOptions: (A) The scientific method is a series of steps that scientists use to answer questions. (B) The scientific method is a series of steps that scientists use to answer questions about plants. (C) The scientific method is a series of steps that scientists use to answer questions",

An observation is a description of something that you see or experience. For example, you might observe that a plant is growing in a certain way.\nThe next step is to ask a question about the observation. For example, you might ask why the plant is growing in that way.\nThe third step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a possible explanation for the observation. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant is growing in that way because it is getting too much sunlight.\nThe fourth step is to test the hypothesis. To test the hypothesis, you must design an experiment. An experiment is a procedure that tests a hypothesis. For example, you might design an experiment to test whether the plant is getting too much sunlight.\nThe fifth step is to analyze the results of the experiment. To analyze the results, you must collect data. Data are facts and figures that are collected during an experiment. For example, you might collect data on how much sunlight the plant is getting.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that explains what you have learned from the experiment. For example, you might conclude that the plant is growing in that way because it is getting too much sunlight.\nOptions: (A) The scientific method is a series of steps that scientists use to solve problems.
