    "3153": "Which of the following could Robert's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (D) how much a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing at 200 km per hour\nThe answer is D\n\nQuestion: What is the main idea of the text?\nContext: Read the text.\n\nThe first step in the engineering-design process is to identify a problem.

For example, you might ask why the plant is growing in that way.\nThe third step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a possible explanation for the observation. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant is growing in that way because it is getting too much sunlight.\nThe fourth step is to test the hypothesis. To test the hypothesis, you must design an experiment. An experiment is a procedure that tests a hypothesis. For example, you might design an experiment to test whether the plant is getting too much sunlight.\nThe fifth step is to analyze the results of the experiment. To analyze the results, you must collect data. Data are facts and figures that are collected during an experiment. For example, you might collect data on how much sunlight the plant is getting.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (D) how much a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing at 200 km per hour\nThe answer is D\n\nQuestion: What is the main idea of the text?\nContext: Read the text.\n\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem.

An observation is a description of something that you see or experience. For example, you might observe that a plant is growing in a certain place.\nThe next step is to ask a question. A question is a sentence that asks about something that you want to learn. For example, you might ask, \"Why is the plant growing in that place?\"\nThe third step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a possible answer to a question. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant is growing in that place because it gets a lot of sunlight there.\nThe fourth step is to test the hypothesis. To test a hypothesis, you must do an experiment. An experiment is a procedure that you follow to test a hypothesis. For example, you might move the plant to a place that gets less sunlight. If the plant dies, then your hypothesis is not correct. If the plant lives, then your hypothesis might be correct.\nThe fifth step is to analyze the data. Data are the results of an experiment. To analyze data, you must look at the data and think about what they mean. For example, if the plant dies when you move it to a place that gets less sunlight, then you know that the plant needs a lot of sunlight to live.\nThe sixth step is to draw a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that answers the question. For example, you might conclude that the",

The 's skin is adapted to ward off predators.\nFigure: strawberry poison frog.\nOptions: (A) gray tree frog (B) Spanish shawl nudibranch\nThe answer is B\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is the best summary of the text?\nContext: Read the text.\nThe first step in the scientific method is to make an observation. An observation is a description of something that you see or experience. For example, you might observe that a plant is growing in a certain place.\nThe next step is to ask a question. A question is a sentence that asks about something that you want to learn. For example, you might ask, \"Why is the plant growing in that place?\"\nThe next step is to form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a possible answer to your question. For example, you might hypothesize that the plant is growing in that place because it gets a lot of sunlight there.\nThe next step is to test your hypothesis. To test your hypothesis, you must do an experiment. An experiment is a procedure that you follow to test your hypothesis. For example, you might move the plant to a place that gets less sunlight. If the plant dies, then your hypothesis is incorrect. If the plant lives, then your hypothesis is correct.\nThe final step is to draw a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that explains what you learned from your experiment. For example, you might conclude that the plant needs a lot of sunlight to live.\nOptions: (A) The scientific method is a series of steps that scientists follow to learn about the world.
