One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars.

The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

It was a volcano erupting under the water!\nFigure: the erupting undersea volcano seen by the sailors on the Isleifur II.\nOptions: (A) He heard a report on the radio warning about a volcanic eruption.

Then, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar.\nFigure: a new steel nail on a pile of rusty nails.\nOptions: (A) Do steel nails rust in fewer days when submerged in a large volume of liquid compared to a small volume? (B) Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar? (C) Do steel nails rust faster in water than in vinegar?\nThe answer is B\n\nQuestion: What is the main idea of the passage?\nContext: Read the passage below.\n\nThe first time I saw a rainbow, I was in awe.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.
