In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).\nA certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene.\nOptions: (A) white flowers (B) red flowers"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\n###\nANSWER: A."}], "model_answer": "uestion: What information supports the conclusion that Olivia inherited this trait?\nContext: Read the description of a trait.\nOlivia has straight hair.\nOptions: (A) Olivia's neighbor also has straight hair.

In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).\nA certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene.\nOptions: (A) white flowers (B) red flowers"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\n###\nANSWER: A."}], "model_answer": "uestion: What information supports the conclusion that Olivia inherited this trait?\nContext: Read the description of a trait.\nOlivia has straight hair.\nOptions: (A) Olivia's neighbor also has straight hair.

In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).\nA certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene.\nOptions: (A) white flowers (B) red flowers"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\n###\nANSWER: A."}], "model_answer": "uestion: What information supports the conclusion that Olivia inherited this trait?\nContext: Read the description of a trait.\nOlivia has straight hair.\nOptions: (A) Olivia's neighbor also has straight hair.

In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).\nA certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene.\nOptions: (A) white flowers (B) red flowers"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\n###\nANSWER: A."}], "model_answer": "Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the flower color trait?\nContext: In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n\nSOLUTION: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a reddish-brown coat or a black coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for a black coat, is dominant over the l allele, which is for a reddish-brown coat.\nA reddish-brown coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the recessive version of the coat color trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat color gene.
