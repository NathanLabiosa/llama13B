One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour", "text": "Gordon's test in the wind tunnel showed how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour.

Each student has different books in her backpack.\nOptions: (A) a backpack carrying 9 pounds (B) a backpack carrying 6 pounds", "text": "In this scenario, the backpack carrying 9 pounds would be pulled with a larger force than the backpack carrying 6 pounds.\nTo see why, let's consider the force required to move an object. The force required to move an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. In this case, the mass of the backpacks is the same, so we can compare the acceleration of the two backpacks.\nThe acceleration of an object is determined by its mass and the force applied to it. In this case, the force applied to the backpacks is the force exerted by the students on the backpacks. Since the students are pulling the backpacks with the same force, the acceleration of the two backpacks will be the same.\nHowever, the backpack carrying 9 pounds has a greater mass than the backpack carrying 6 pounds.

{"question_id": "5200", "prompt": "Logan starts to pull the wagon across the yard. To move the wagon at the same speed each time, which friend does Logan need to pull with a larger force?\nContext: Logan gives two friends a ride in his wagon. One friend sits in the wagon at a time.\nOptions: (A) a friend who weighs 24 pounds (B) a friend who weighs 25 pounds", "text": "The correct answer is (B) a friend who weighs 25 pounds.\nTo move the wagon at the same speed each time, Logan needs to pull with a force that is proportional to the weight of the friend sitting in the wagon. Since the wagon can only hold one friend at a time, the force required to move the wagon will depend on the weight of the friend sitting in the wagon.\nIf Logan pulls with a force that is proportional to the weight of the friend sitting in the wagon, then the force required to move the wagon will be the same for each friend.\nFor example, if a friend weighs 25 pounds, then Logan will need to pull with a force that is proportional to 25 pounds. If a friend weighs 24 pounds, then Logan will need to pull with a force that is proportional to 24 pounds.\nTherefore, the friend who weighs 25 pounds will require a larger force to move the wagon at the same speed as the friend who weighs 24 pounds."}

The carts are the same. Each cart is holding different tools.\nOptions: (A) a cart holding 50 pounds (B) a cart holding 62 pounds", "text": "The cart holding 62 pounds is pulled with a larger force.\nExplanation: The force required to pull a cart is equal to the weight of the cart multiplied by the force applied perpendicular to the direction of motion. Since the weight of the cart is the same in both cases, the difference in force is due to the force applied perpendicular to the direction of motion.\nIn the case of the cart holding 50 pounds, the force applied perpendicular to the direction of motion is 50 pounds (the weight of the cart) multiplied by the force applied. In the case of the cart holding 62 pounds, the force applied perpendicular to the direction of motion is 62 pounds (the weight of the cart) multiplied by the force applied.\nTherefore, the cart holding 62 pounds is pulled with a larger force."}

{"question_id": "8296", "image": "8296/image.png", "prompt": "<image>\nWhich term matches the picture?\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning", "text": "The correct term that matches the picture is operant conditioning."}

{"question_id": "8732", "image": "8732/image.png", "prompt": "<image>\nBased on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nContext: Read the text about cats.\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.

(D) Both are only physical changes.", "text": "(B) Both are caused by heating.\nExplanation:\nBoth sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle and dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas are caused by heating. Sediment settling occurs when the particles in the muddy puddle become heavier and sink to the bottom due to their increased density caused by the cooling of the water. Similarly, dry ice sublimates when it is exposed to air, and the process is caused by the absorption of heat from the surroundings.\nOption (A) is incorrect because sediment settling is a physical change, while dry ice sublimation is a chemical change.

Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients.\nFigure: studying bacteria in a laboratory.\nOptions: (A) whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin (B) whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin (C) whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster", "text": "Kaylee's test showed that the bacteria produced more insulin when given extra nutrients. This indicates that the engineering-design process was successful in developing a solution to the problem of increasing the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria. The test results suggest that the bacteria were able to produce more insulin with the added nutrients, which supports the idea that the engineering-design process can be used to develop effective solutions to problems."}

{"question_id": "16126", "image": "16126/image.png", "prompt": "<image>\nBased on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nContext: Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech.", "text": "The Egyptian fruit bats can communicate with many kinds of animals, but they are unique in their ability to communicate about specific problems and understand some human speech. They can communicate about specific problems, such as arguing over food, figuring out where they are going to sleep, and addressing different members of the group. Additionally, they can understand some human speech, as they have been known to respond to human speech and even imitate it."}

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDuncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour", "text": "Duncan's test in the wind tunnel showed how much the parachute with a 1 m vent swung at 200 km per hour.
