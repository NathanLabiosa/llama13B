One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour", "text": "The test conducted by Gordon in the wind tunnel showed that a parachute with a 1 m vent was steady at 200 km per hour."}

(C) Does a pie crust made with white flour burn more quickly than a pie crust made with whole wheat flour?", "text": "Farid can investigate the factors that affect whether a pie crust will burn in the oven using the following experiment:\n\nExperiment: Compare the burning time of a pie crust made with white flour in a glass pie pan versus an aluminum pie pan.\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n2. Roll out one pie crust made with white flour to fit a glass pie pan. Place it in the glass pie pan and press the edges to form a tight seal.\n3. Roll out the second pie crust made with white flour and place it in an aluminum pie pan. Press the edges to form a tight seal.\n4. Place both pies in the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes.\n5. Remove the pies from the oven and carefully check the burning time of each pie crust. A crust is considered burned when it starts to turn brown and becomes hard and crisp.\n6. Record the burning time of each pie crust.\n\nResults:\n\n* If the white flour pie crust in the glass pie pan burns more quickly than the aluminum pie crust, it may indicate that the glass pan causes the crust to heat up faster, leading to burning.\n* If the white flour pie crust in the aluminum pie pan burns more quickly than the glass pie crust, it may indicate that the aluminum pan causes the crust to heat up faster, leading to burning.\n* If the white flour pie crust in both pans burns at the same rate, it may indicate that other factors, such as the thickness of the crust or the type of filling, have a greater impact on burning time.\n\nConclusion:\n\n* The experiment can help Farid determine whether the type of pan or other factors affect the burning time of a pie crust.\n* The results of the experiment can provide insights into how to prevent pie crusts from burning during baking."}

Therefore, the colder piece of rope will have more thermal energy than the hotter piece of rope.\n\nThe formula for thermal energy (U) is:\nU = m \\* c \\* T\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object, c is the specific heat capacity of the object, and T is the temperature of the object.\n\nSince the two pieces of rope have the same mass (15 grams), the only difference between them is their temperature. Therefore, we can write:\n\nU\\_hot = m \\* c \\* T\\_hot\nU\\_cold = m \\* c \\* T\\_cold\n\nwhere T\\_hot is the temperature of the hotter piece of rope and T\\_cold is the temperature of the colder piece of rope.\n\nSince the hotter piece of rope has a higher temperature than the colder piece of rope, it will also have a higher thermal energy. However, since the mass of the two pieces of rope is the same, the specific heat capacity of the rope will be the same for both pieces. Therefore, we can write:\n\nU\\_hot > U\\_cold\n\nm \\* c \\* T\\_hot > m \\* c \\* T\\_cold\n\nT\\_hot > T\\_cold\n\nTherefore, the hotter piece of rope has more thermal energy than the colder piece of rope, but the colder piece of rope has more thermal energy than the hotter piece of rope."}

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed.

{"question_id": "3479", "prompt": "How long does it take for an ice cube to melt on a hot sidewalk?\nContext: Select the better estimate.\nOptions: (A) 4 hours (B) 4 minutes", "text": "The correct answer is (B) 4 minutes.\n\nWhen an ice cube is placed on a hot sidewalk, it will melt due to the heat from the sidewalk. The rate at which it melts depends on various factors such as the temperature of the sidewalk, the size of the ice cube, and the humidity in the air. In general, an ice cube will melt relatively quickly on a hot sidewalk, but the exact time it takes to melt completely cannot be determined without more information.\n\nHowever, we can make a reasonable estimate based on the fact that ice typically melts at a rate of about 1 cm per 10 minutes when left in room temperature water. If the sidewalk is significantly hotter than room temperature, the ice cube will melt more quickly. For example, if the sidewalk temperature is 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F), the ice cube will melt in just a few minutes.\n\nTherefore, the better estimate for the time it takes for an ice cube to melt on a hot sidewalk is 4 minutes."}

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour", "text": "The engineering-design process is a systematic approach to problem-solving that involves multiple steps, including identifying the problem, researching, planning, prototyping, testing, and evaluating the solution. In this case, Ernest used the engineering-design process to develop a solution for the parachute of a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He added a vent at the center of the parachute to ensure a smooth landing at high speeds. To test the solution, he put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel and observed how much it swung at 200 km per hour. The test showed that the parachute with a 1 m vent swung too much, indicating that the vent was too small. Therefore, the solution was not successful in meeting the requirements of the design."}

It is used to hold small fish or other aquatic creatures. The volume of a fish bowl can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = (Area \u00d7 Length) / 2\n\nwhere Area is the surface area of the fish bowl and Length is the length of the fish bowl.\n\nFor a typical fish bowl, the surface area can be estimated as the product of the diameter and the depth. The diameter of a fish bowl is typically around 6 inches (15 cm), and the depth is usually around 4 inches (10 cm). So, the surface area of the fish bowl can be estimated as:\n\nArea = (6 inches) \u00d7 (4 inches) = 24 square inches\n\nThe length of the fish bowl is usually around 8 inches (20 cm). So, the volume of the fish bowl can be estimated as:\n\nVolume = (24 square inches) \u00d7 (8 inches) / 2 = 38.4 ounces (around 1120 ml)\n\nTherefore, the best estimate for the volume of a fish bowl is (C) 1 gallon, which is 3.785411784 liters.

The higher the temperature of an object, the more thermal energy it has. The formula for thermal energy (U) is:\n\nU = m \\* c\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and c is the specific heat capacity of the object.\n\nFor both objects, we know that they are identical except for their temperatures. Therefore, they have the same mass (150 grams). To find the thermal energy of each object, we need to know their specific heat capacities.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water (which is the majority component of orange juice) is approximately 4.18 J/g\u00b0C. The specific heat capacity of air is approximately 1005 J/kg\u00b0C.\n\nFor the glass of orange juice at 50\u00b0F, we can use the specific heat capacity of water:\n\nU1 = m1 \\* c1 = (150 g) \\* (4.18 J/g\u00b0C) \\* (50\u00b0F \\* 9/5\u00b0C = 200\u00b0F) = 112,200 J\n\nFor the glass of orange juice at 40\u00b0F, we can use the specific heat capacity of air:\n\nU2 = m2 \\* c2 = (150 g) \\* (1005 J/kg\u00b0C) \\* (40\u00b0F \\* 9/5\u00b0C = -40\u00b0F) = 22,800 J\n\nTherefore, the glass of orange juice at a temperature of 40\u00b0F has less thermal energy than the glass of orange juice at a temperature of 50\u00b0F."}

{"question_id": "8296", "image": "8296/image.png", "prompt": "<image>\nWhich term matches the picture?\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning", "text": "The term that matches the picture is (B) classical conditioning."}

{"question_id": "8732", "image": "8732/image.png", "prompt": "<image>\nBased on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nContext: Read the text about cats.\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.

Preheat the oven to the same temperature (usually around 350\u00b0F or 180\u00b0C) and prepare the pie crusts according to the recipe.\n2. Divide one pie crust into two equal pieces and shape them into disks. Place one disk in a glass pie pan and the other in an aluminum pie pan.\n3. Bake the crusts in the oven for a set amount of time, such as 10-15 minutes, or until they are slightly golden brown.\n4.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour", "text": "(B) How steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour."}

Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech.", "text": "Option (B) is the correct answer.
