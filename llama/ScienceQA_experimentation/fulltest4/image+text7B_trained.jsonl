One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour", "text": "The image shows a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel. The purpose of this test is to determine the effectiveness of the parachute design in the event of a high-speed landing. Gordon's test could show the stability of the parachute with a 1 m vent at 200 km per hour. By observing the parachute's movement and swinging, Gordon can evaluate whether the vent size is appropriate for the intended landing conditions. The test results will help refine the parachute design and ensure a safe landing for the spacecraft."}

She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Helen wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.\nSo, Helen put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.\nFigure: a drone without blade guards.\nOptions: (A) if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly (B) if the blade guards would break in a crash (C) how much the drone weighed with the blade guards", "text": "The image shows a group of people, including Helen, gathered around a table with a drone. They are likely discussing the design and testing of the drone, specifically the blade guards. The test could show if the blade guards made the drone fly poorly, if they would break in a crash, or if they added too much weight to the drone. The test results would help Helen determine if the blade guards are a viable solution to the problem of propeller damage in the warehouse."}

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour", "text": "The engineering-design process is a systematic and iterative approach to solving problems. In this case, Ernest used a wind tunnel to test the effectiveness of a parachute with a 1 m vent at 200 km per hour. By observing the parachute's movement and measuring its swing, he could determine whether the vent size was appropriate for the spacecraft's landing requirements. The wind tunnel allowed him to simulate the high-speed conditions that the parachute would experience during landing. Therefore, the test could show whether the parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour."}

The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.\nA certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.\nThis different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.\nFigure: muscles in the human body.\nOptions: (A) chloride channel protein . . .

{"question_id": "8296", "image": "8296/image.png", "prompt": "<image>\nWhich term matches the picture?\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning", "text": "The term that matches the picture is operant conditioning."}

{"question_id": "8732", "image": "8732/image.png", "prompt": "<image>\nBased on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nContext: Read the text about cats.\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMason was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour", "text": "The image shows a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.\nIn a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.\nOptions: (A) 1/4 (B) 3/4 (C) 2/4 (D) 0/4 (E) 4/4", "text": "The Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies, one with vestigial wings (n) and the other with normal wings (N). The gene for the wing type trait has two alleles: n for vestigial wings and N for normal wings. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).\n\nTo determine the probability of a fruit fly produced by this cross having normal wings, we need to consider the possible combinations of alleles.

Nn: The fruit fly will have vestigial wings (n).\n3. nN: The fruit fly will have normal wings (N).\n4. nn: The fruit fly will have vestigial wings (n).\n\nSince the gene for the wing type trait is dominant (N), the probability of a fruit fly having normal wings (N) is 3/4, or 3/4 \u00d7 100% = 75%. The probability of a fruit fly having vestigial wings (n) is 1/4, or 1/4 \u00d7 100% = 25%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 0/4, as there is no possibility of a fruit fly having both alleles for vestigial wings (nn) in this cross."}

Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech.", "text": "(B) They can communicate about specific problems."}
