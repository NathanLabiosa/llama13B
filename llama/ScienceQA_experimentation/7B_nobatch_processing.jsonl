In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).\nA certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene.\nOptions: (A) white flowers (B) red flowers"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.\n###\nANSWER: A."}], "model_answer": " Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the flower color trait?\nContext: In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n\nSOLUTION: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a reddish-brown coat or a black coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for a black coat, is dominant over the l allele, which is for a reddish-brown coat.\nA reddish-brown coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the recessive version of the coat color trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat color gene.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce.

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.\nThe atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.\nAn elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.\nThe atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.\nFor example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.\nA compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.\nThe chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.\nFor example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.\nSOLUTION: You can tell whether sodium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.\nThe chemical formula for sodium bromide, NaBr, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and Br for bromine.

In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.\nThe volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12\nIf their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\nTo multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent.

In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.\nThe volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12\nIf their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\nTo multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 \u00b7 1000\n= 1.43 x 10^15 \u00b7 10^3\n= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)\n= 1.43 x 10^18\n\nSOLUTION: To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.\nThen compare the result to the volume of Mars. The volume of Mars is 1.63 x 10^11 km^3, which is less than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3.

Skip has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the horns gene.\nOptions: (A) not having horns (B) having horns"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: You need to determine Skip's phenotype for the horns trait. First, consider the alleles in Skip's genotype for the horns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nSkip's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait.

Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.\nScientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.\nA ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.\nThe balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.\nNotice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter.

A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.\nHere are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:\nThis is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.\nThis is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.\nThis is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.\nAn organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.\n###\nANSWER: C."}], "model_answer": " Which trait did Palaeopython have?

The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h).\nA certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype hh for the stem height gene.\nOptions: (A) a short stem (B) a tall stem"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "LECTURE: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nSOLUTION: The pea plant's genotype for the stem height gene is hh. The pea plant's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for a short stem. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nThe pea plant's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait.
