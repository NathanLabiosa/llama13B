This aligns with the common understanding that people often put in extra effort and time when they are seeking to achieve a specific goal or objective, such as a promotion, new job, or financial security.\n\nIn the second scenario, the known person, Billy, might not have been a close friend or family member but rather an acquaintance or colleague. The statement \"Billy wasn't a stranger, but they hadn't spoken to him often, either\" implies that there was some level of familiarity or recognition between the speaker and Billy but not close enough to be considered a part of their inner circle.\n\nFinally, the third scenario states that people read newspapers in the subway while commuting to work. This is a common sight in many cities with well-established public transportation systems, as it allows commuters to catch up on the news or prepare for the day while traveling to their destination. The other options, such as a bookstore or library, might be more typical places where people would read newspapers but are not accurate descriptions of where a commuter would likely read their newspaper during their daily commute.\n\nIn summary, the correct answers to these questions provide insights into human behavior and common scenarios, such as motivation and ambition, recognition of acquaintances, and daily newspaper reading habits."}
