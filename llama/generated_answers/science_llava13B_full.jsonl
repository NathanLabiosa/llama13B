{"question_id": "5", "image": "5/image.png", "prompt": "Which of the following could Gordon's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour .

{"question_id": "3505", "image": "3505/image.png", "prompt": "Which term matches the picture?\nContext: Read the text.\nInvertebrates make up the majority of Earth's living things, but there are many different groups, or phyla, of invertebrates. Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins.

{"question_id": "8296", "image": "8296/image.png", "prompt": "Which term matches the picture?\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning . Think step by step and justify your steps.\n<image>", "text": "Assistant: The term \"operant conditioning\" matches the picture, as it refers to a process in which an animal learns to associate a voluntary behavior with a reward or punishment.

Think step by step and justify your steps.", "text": "Assistant: The two changes, a copper statue turning green and firing a clay pot in a hot kiln, both involve the transformation of materials through different processes. In the case of the copper statue, exposure to the elements, especially air and moisture, over time causes the copper to oxidize and turn green. This is a physical change, as the structure of the copper remains the same, but its appearance and properties change.\n\nOn the other hand, firing a clay pot in a hot kiln involves a chemical and physical transformation. The clay undergoes a process called vitrification, where it is heated to a high temperature, causing the individual clay particles to fuse together and form a solid, yet porous, structure. The firing process also causes chemical reactions to occur within the clay, resulting in the formation of new compounds and strengthening the overall structure of the pot. The final product is both physically stronger and chemically altered compared to the original clay.\n\nTherefore, both changes involve the transformation of materials through processes that involve heat and chemical reactions, although the specific details and outcomes differ for the copper statue and the fired clay pot.", "answer_id": "Xf8C3mKLcNg23eLwJJqrFB", "model_id": "llava13B", "metadata": {}}

{"question_id": "8732", "image": "8732/image.png", "prompt": "Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nContext: Read the text about cats.\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.

In the case of the muddy puddle, the sediment contains solids (like soil) and liquids (like water), and over time, the particles will settle and form a layer at the bottom. Similarly, dry ice undergoes a sublimation process, where it changes from a solid (dry ice) directly into a gas (carbon dioxide) without becoming a liquid in between.

Think step by step and justify your steps.", "text": "Assistant: Both the processes of sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle and an iceberg melting slowly are examples of natural phenomena resulting from various environmental factors. In the case of the muddy puddle, sediment and other particles will settle due to gravity, which is a force of attraction between the particles and the Earth. Gravity causes denser objects to fall and less dense objects to rise. In the case of the melting iceberg, the cooling process, which could be caused by air or water currents, results in the gradual melting of the ice. As the temperature falls below the melting point, the ice converts from a solid to a liquid state.\n\nBoth processes involve changes in the state of matter or substance, with sediment settling being a deposition process and melting being a solid-to-liquid phase transition.

It was one of the original thirteen colonies in America, and it played a significant role in the formation and development of the United States. Massachusetts was established in 1620, when a group of English Puritans, led by John Winthrop, arrived at the site of the present-day city of Boston. They initially established a brief settlement at Salem but later moved to Boston, which became the colony's capital in 1630.\n\nThroughout its history, Massachusetts has been at the forefront of several important events in American history. The colony became a center of the transatlantic trade in codfish and other goods, which provided the economic foundation for its growth. In the 18th century, it played a crucial role in the American Enlightenment, with thinkers such as John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Benjamin Franklin helping to shape the intellectual and political climate that led to the American Revolution.\n\nAfter the revolution, Massachusetts became one of the original six states in the United States of America, and it continued to be a major industrial and economic center in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was the site of several significant historical events, such as the Boston Tea Party and the Siege of Boston, which were critical moments in the lead-up to the American Revolution.\n\nOverall, Massachusetts has a rich historical legacy as one of the first English colonies in North America, playing a central role in several critical periods in American history, including the development of the transatlantic trade, the American Enlightenment, the American Revolution, and the growth of industry in the 19th and 20th centuries.", "answer_id": "N5TWWHhsjyBE73ZN9heuSk", "model_id": "llava13B", "metadata": {}}

He can design an experiment that compares the cleanliness of dishes washed with a dishwasher, a soapy sponge, a soapy rag, liquid dish detergent, and bar soap. This will help him determine which method removes oil and grease more effectively from the dishes. To conduct this experiment, he can follow a series of steps:\n1. Preparing the dirty dishes: Emmett should ensure that the dishes are equally dirty to start with, and they contain some oil or grease that can be easily noticed.\n2. Setting up the experiment: Emmett can label the different treatments (e.g., A, B, and C) and ensure that the supplies are organized and ready to use.\n3. Washing the dishes: Emmett should wash each set of dirty dishes using one of the methods being tested (e.g., using a dishwasher, a soapy sponge, a soapy rag, liquid dish detergent, or bar soap).\n4. Observing and measuring the results: After washing, Emmett should inspect the dishes for any remaining oil or grease. He can use a clean cloth to wipe the dishes and re-inspect after each method. He should record his observations in a table or graph for a better understanding of the results.\n5. Analyzing the data: Emmett should compare the results from each treatment and determine which method removed the most oil and grease from the dishes.\n6. Concluding and communicating the results: Emmett can conclude the experiment by summarizing the findings and determine which method is the most effective for cleaning dirty dishes with oil or grease. He can share his findings with others to help them understand which method they should choose for cleaning their dishes.", "answer_id": "F6nzxsWrBDgeh6rKQwDpuE", "model_id": "llava13B", "metadata": {}}

These combinations are represented as L (dominant) and l (recessive). Since the cross is between two heterozygous individuals (Ll and LIL), the probability of the offspring being homozygous for the dominant allele (LL) or the recessive allele (l) depends on the specific combination of alleles inherited from each parent.\n\nFor example, if the parents are Ll and LIL, the offspring could inherit the L allele from both parents (LL), the l allele from both parents (ll), or one L and one l allele (Ll or ll). In this case, the probability of the offspring being homozygous for the dominant allele (LL) or the recessive allele (l) would be:\n\n1.

Think step by step and justify your steps.", "text": "Answer: (B) Both are physical changes.\n\nIn this case, the two changes being described are both physical changes. The process of sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a natural process that occurs due to gravity and the accumulation of particles in the water, making the water progressively clearer. Similarly, shaking up a salad dressing container causes physical mixing of the ingredients, which results in a uniform distribution of the dressing throughout the salad. Both processes involve the transformation of the physical state of the substances or system, but do not involve any chemical reactions.", "answer_id": "atZxT447AriY2QxhaN8URH", "model_id": "llava13B", "metadata": {}}

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour . Think step by step and justify your steps.\n<image>", "text": "Human: Which of the following could Kenji's test show?", "answer_id": "g8z3mxBZB9FH73GsHpMeH4", "model_id": "llava13B", "metadata": {}}

{"question_id": "16126", "image": "16126/image.png", "prompt": "Based on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nContext: Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech. .
