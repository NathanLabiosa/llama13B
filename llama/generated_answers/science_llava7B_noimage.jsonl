{"question_id": "3153", "prompt": "Which of the following could Robert's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour .

{"question_id": "18796", "prompt": "Which of the following could Colette and Alexandra's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nColette and Alexandra were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nOptions: (A) if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use (B) if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry .
