They learn about addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and other operations to help them make accurate calculations and solve problems.\n\nFor example, a child might ask about the cost of a toy in a store. They could use addition to calculate the cost of a toy that is on sale in the store along with the cost of a toy that is full-price. They might also use multiplication to make sure they have enough money to make the purchase.\n\nIn the same way, a child might calculate the cost of ingredients needed for a recipe, or they might use division to find the number of items in a set. By applying mathematical operations to real-world situations, children develop a stronger understanding of how math relates to their everyday lives.\n\nIn the given examples, the child reads the questions and answers, which encourages them to apply mathematical operations to solve problems. This helps them to build their problem-solving skills and develop a deeper understanding of basic math concepts."}
